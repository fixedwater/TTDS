      <TEXT>Years ago, when I was still practicing pediatrics, I was doing a yearly exam on a 9-year-old. He was telling me how strong he was getting to be.

Suddenly, he fired a question I didn’t expect: “Dr. Gordon, how strong do I have to be to be a man?”

Without stopping to consider, I answered, “Johnny, to be a man, you have to be strong enough to be gentle.” The adult answer confused the child, but as so often happens, the immediate, spontaneous answer found the truth.

I realized that it was now my responsibility to remember what this child had pulled out of me. When told about it, a minister friend broke into a big smile and nodded.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>While the rest of the nation waits to learn if it will ever get to read the final report of the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, and debates whether a recent letter written by Attorney General William P. Barr provided an adequate overview of the two-year investigation and its results, “Saturday Night Live” is here to tell you what it all means.

In its opening sketch this weekend, Robert De Niro returned to “S.N.L.” in his recurring role as Mueller, composing his report, which, section by section, was then summarized by Barr (Aidy Bryant), which in turn was distilled into a tweet posted by President Trump.

Each performer offered an introduction at the start of the sketch. De Niro said, “Dear Attorney General Barr, officials from the Justice Department and esteemed members of Congress.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Robert DeProspero, who after the attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan in 1981 became the Secret Service agent in charge of Reagan’s protection and added measures to shore up the president’s safety, died on Monday in Scottsdale, Ariz. He was 80.

His son, Robert, said the cause was amyloidosis, a rare disease in which an abnormal protein is deposited in tissues and organs.

Mr. DeProspero was driven by his obligation to shield the president from harm. “There’s no question that if you made a wrong move or did not do what you were supposed to do, it would ruin your life, your family’s life, and would ruin anyone who was associated with you,” he told The Associated Press in 1985.

A former biology teacher and wrestling coach, Mr. DeProspero joined the Secret Service in 1965 and protected presidents, vice presidents, presidential candidates and one former president, Dwight D. Eisenhower. He said the Secret Service could never do too much to fulfill its obligation to the president.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The Mueller investigation is over, and the only people close to Donald Trump who have been criminally charged are his former campaign chairman, former deputy campaign chairman, former personal lawyer, former national security adviser, former campaign foreign policy adviser and Roger Stone, the president’s longtime friend and strategist. The report written by the special counsel Robert Mueller, according to a quotation in a brief summary issued by Attorney General William Barr, says that “while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.” Naturally, the president and his allies are claiming, as one of Trump’s tweets said, “Complete and Total EXONERATION.”

I won’t pretend that the weekend’s news was not very good for Trump and dispiriting for those of us who despise him. Whatever else is in the Mueller report, it says, according to Barr, that the investigation “did not establish” that anyone from the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its 2016 election interference. The overtures we all know about — the Trump Tower meeting, Trump’s public call for Russia to obtain Hillary Clinton’s emails, which Russian hackers tried to do that very day — were not part of a crime, or at least not part of a crime that the special counsel could prove. There will be no deus ex Mueller bringing this wretched presidency to an early end. On the contrary, Trump is emboldened, and his foes momentarily defensive.

Until the Mueller report is publicly released, however, it’s impossible to tell how much of Trump’s victory is substantive and how much is spin. The report, evidently, leaves open the question of whether Trump obstructed justice. In his letter to Congress about the report, Barr said that he and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, made the determination that no obstruction of justice occurred. Of course, last year Barr wrote a memo calling Mueller’s obstruction investigation “grossly irresponsible” and “fatally misconceived,” which is surely why Trump appointed him in the first place. There is no reason for anyone to take his finding seriously.

      <TEXT>We call them upsets. But unless you root for the team on the wrong end of one, they are the happiest things on Earth. They should be called overjoyeds.

There are two kinds of tournament underdogs. There is the team that makes an unlikely deep run — to the second weekend, the regional final, the Final Four — by artfully dodging the biggest threats, by emerging as a great squad in its own right. Then there is the team that knocks off a contender before normalcy reasserts itself. The first kind is a new planet, or an aged single-malt scotch; the second kind is a comet, or a tequila shot.

[Follow our live coverage of Day 1 of the N.C.A.A. tournament here.]

Here are some tequila shots. No predictions are made for this year’s Loyola-Chicago, the No. 11 seed that made last year’s Final Four through the blessings of Sister Jean, good shooting and the luck of facing a No. 9 seed in the regional final.

Rather, these six teams stand a better chance of winning their first games than you — and, more important-, the other people in your pool — might think. Don’t sleep on the unlikeliest likeliest of all, at the bottom.</TEXT>

Lorraine Shanley’s husband was a New York City police officer who died in the line of duty, and in the years after his death, she became active in a charity that supports the families of other officers who died on the job. She eventually volunteered to be a treasurer for the charity, Survivors of the Shield, and was in charge of nearly $2 million in donations.

But prosecutors say a desire to help others was not her only motivation. They have accused Ms. Shanley of stealing about $410,000 over a seven-year period for her personal expenses, from dental work and landscaping to tickets to see Barbra Streisand in concert. She even pilfered the charity’s coffers to pay for her son’s criminal defense, according to a federal criminal complaint.

Ms. Shanley, 68, of Staten Island, was arrested on Thursday after she surrendered at the Manhattan federal prosecutor’s office in Lower Manhattan, a stone’s throw from Police Headquarters. She was charged with bank fraud and aggravated identity theft, and was released on a $100,000 bond after a brief appearance in Federal District Court.

She shook her head and declined to speak to reporters as she left the courtroom. If convicted, she faces up to 30 years in prison.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The more established Hindutva organizations, including the R.S.S. (the Hindu-nationalist paramilitary group) and B.J.P., have tried to distance themselves from such groups and have raised legal complaints against those who have tried to connect them to violence perpetrated by the Hindutva fringe. In February, a magistrate ruled that Rahul Gandhi, the president of the Congress Party, would stand trial for defamation for implying a link between the R.S.S. and Lankesh’s murder.

Late one night I met with N.P. Amruthesh, the lawyer for four of the accused men, who is himself a proud follower of the Sanatan Sanstha. An affable man, seemingly indifferent to appearances, he wore a worn orange dhoti and white shirt with a blue ink stain billowing out beneath the pocket. While we spoke, a news segment about Lankesh’s case appeared on his TV: The R.S.S., it was reported, had issued a statement saying that the latest man arrested, Mohan Nayak, who is not represented by Amruthesh, was not a member of the organization. Amruthesh laughed. “In my opinion, personal opinion, that is not correct,” he said. “When any person is working for Hindutva, it is your duty to give protection to that person. ... They’re claiming that he’s not our member, but I came to know that he always goes to R.S.S. activities and everything. These organizations, they don’t want to take the responsibility.” Such disavowals, he said, were bad for morale.

Narendra Modi, meanwhile, has kept his silence. He has never publicly mentioned Lankesh’s name or referred to her case. “Why should Prime Minister Modi react?” Muthalik, the Sri Ram Sene leader, said in a public speech. “Do you expect Modi to respond every time a dog dies in Karnataka?”

Perhaps the most extraordinary discovery the police have made in their investigation of Lankesh’s murder is a detailed diary recovered from the home of a leading suspect. In it were two lists, ostensibly of people the conspirators wanted dead, reportedly including Veerabhadra Chennamalla, a liberal-minded Hindu priest, and K.S. Bhagavan, an outspokenly atheist Shakespeare scholar. First on one of the lists was Girish Karnad, who is perhaps the greatest living Kannada playwright. All have been particularly forthright in their criticism of Hindutva.

Second on one list was Lankesh. In the months since she was shot, some of her friends and colleagues have grown more cautious about what they write and say and post to social media, even as this year’s unusually fraught and uncertain Election Day approaches. Others have found themselves speaking out almost compulsively where they wouldn’t have before. Prakash Raj, a popular film actor and friend of Lankesh’s who had previously been quiet on politics, is now running for office on what could be called the Gauri platform. “When we buried Gauri, we were actually sowing her,” he said at a literary festival in January. “They thought she could be silenced, but she lives through us. And if I end up in the Parliament, it will be Gauri’s voice that will be heard there.” When the B.J.P. came to national power in the past, it seemed to have won despite its ideology, campaigning on less divisive issues. But this year’s election feels like a referendum on Hindutva: Is India primarily a country for Hindus, or, as Lankesh insisted, for everyone who’s Indian?

The last two people to have a real conversation with Lankesh were two old friends, Madhu Bhushan and Kalpana Chakravarthy, who dropped by the newspaper office on the afternoon of the day she was murdered to search the archive of Lankesh Patrike, her father’s newspaper, for poems that Chakravarthy’s husband used to submit. They ended up sitting and talking for two and a half hours, as if time had stopped and none of them had anything to do, even though Lankesh’s paper was supposed to go to press the next day.

I met Bhushan, a feminist activist, four months later at Hotel Chalukya, whose restaurant is famous for its big, red triangular dosas. As she ate, she marveled at the vitality, the appetite for life and fight and fun that Lankesh had displayed just hours before she died. I asked what they talked about. “What didn’t we talk about?” Bhushan said. “It was an incredible conversation. We were catching up on 20 years.” They talked about their shared college days, about the era of P. Lankesh, but most of all, “nice, juicy gossip.” Friends had been urging Lankesh to get police protection, but Bhushan recalled Lankesh’s telling her: “I’ve had one marriage. I don’t need a policeman who will replace my husband.”

They talked and laughed until around 6 p.m. As I often saw when Lankesh’s friends spoke of her, Bhushan’s eyes glowed as she recounted the time she spent with her, as though the pleasure of her company still lingered. “She was a very, very genuine human being,” she said. “I guess that’s the most radical thing one can be.”/•/</TEXT>

      <TEXT>RABAT, Morocco — Pope Francis called Saturday to mend the “great and deep wound” opened by the migration crisis, as he spoke during a visit to Morocco which has become the chief destination for sub-Saharan African migrants seeking to reach Europe.

“We do not want our response to be one of indifference and silence,” Francis said to about 80 migrants at a Catholic charity center in Rabat, the Moroccan capital.

Years after the explosion of the migration crisis destabilized Europe and provided fodder for hard-line politicians who surged to power across the continent, the issue seems to have faded and a consensus has emerged that migration needs to be checked and borders closed.

But Francis, who for years has been a lone voice on the migration issue, used his two-day stay in Rabat not only to continue to promote moderate Islam, but also to implore the more comfortable corners of the world to accept, protect and integrate migrants. He urged people to take concrete steps and “act prudently rather than remain silent.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>President Trump has long been fixated on narrowing the trade deficit, which he believes is a measure of whether countries around the world are taking advantage of the U.S. Though few economists share that view, the new figures suggest that by his own metric, Mr. Trump is failing.

Reasons: The increase in the amount of goods imported was driven, in part, by a broader economic slowdown and the strength of the U.S. dollar, both of which weakened global demand for American exports.

The Trump administration’s trade war and tax cuts exacerbated the trend. In fact, the U.S. imported a record amount of goods from China, despite Mr. Trump’s tariffs on billions of dollars’ worth of Chinese goods, and American exports to China fell by nearly 50 percent in December. And money from the tax cuts helped Americans buy more imported goods.

Made in America: Four companies in the U.S. were found to have falsely advertised that their products were American-made when in fact they were manufactured in China.</TEXT>

Napolitano, the former Arizona governor who served as Homeland Security secretary from 2009 to 2013, assesses current risks and vulnerabilities and asks how a security mind-set has affected our culture. THE GREAT FIREWALL OF CHINA: How to Build and Control an Alternative Version of the Internet, by James Griffiths. (ZED, $29.95.) The internet has long been a boon for the free exchange of information, but Griffiths argues that China’s success at monitoring and censoring web traffic poses a cautionary tale for users around the world. WHO WANTS TO BE A JEWISH WRITER? And Other Essays, by Adam Kirsch. (Yale, $26.) The noted poet and critic explores the intersections of literature, religion and politics, among other subjects. “What poetry and religion have in common is that they are both idioms in which we can talk seriously about the things that matter most.” THE ART OF VOICE: Poetic Principles and Practice, by Tony Hoagland with Kay Cosgrove. (Norton, $22.95.) In this craft guide to poetry writing, rich with lively examples, Hoagland (who died in October) argues that a distinctive voice is crucial but too often overlooked. A closing section offers writing prompts and exercises. THE FOUR HORSEMEN: The Conversation That Sparked an Atheist Revolution, foreword by Stephen Fry. (Random House, $23.) The so-called new atheist movement was crystallized in 2007 by a viral documentary that recorded Christopher Hitchens, Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris and Daniel Dennett talking over drinks. This book transcribes their conversation, with added essays.

A fair amount of it is set in and around malls, as Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah takes us on flights of fantasy and horror that subtly, and not so, evoke our conversations around race, violence and opportunity. You will stomach reading of a chainsaw massacre just for the striking, resonant payoff at the end. And your post-Thanksgiving shopping may never be the same. It’s also absurdly funny, but you’ll wonder if you should be laughing .”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>A sheriff in Oklahoma, five of her deputies and several other staff members resigned this week in protest of a judge’s order to reopen a county jail that they had deemed unsafe.

The sheriff, Terry Sue Barnett of Nowata County, said the jail had deteriorated past a point where it could safely house inmates and members of law enforcement. She pointed in particular to a carbon monoxide leak that sent four employees to an emergency room late last month and prompted the jail to temporarily transfer its inmates to another facility.

“The condition of the jail is such that it does not comply with constitutional standards,” Sheriff Barnett said at a news conference on Monday announcing that she, the five deputies, the county undersheriff, the head dispatcher and the canine ranger were stepping down. (She also said the canine ranger’s “paw friend” had resigned, adding, when people did not laugh, “That is supposed to be funny.”)

The carbon monoxide leak’s cause has still not been determined, Sheriff Barnett said, adding that there were other day-to-day safety problems plaguing the jail in Nowata County, which is about 40 miles north of Tulsa, in northeastern Oklahoma.</TEXT>

A lawsuit against Purdue Pharma has thrown back the curtain on the Sacklers, one of America’s wealthiest families. Their company produced OxyContin and subsequently covered up the drug’s addictive qualities, according to the suit. Until recently, the Sacklers have been known for their philanthropy more than their business. But that is changing, as Samantha Bee pointed out in a withering segment of “Full Frontal” on Wednesday.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Whenever bad news arrives, grief swoops down to saturate the decisive moment with significance — suddenly, we’ve never been able to see more clearly. In our effort to cope and ‘‘stay on top of things,’’ ordinary occurrences can become symbolic. While listening to a friend’s anguish and searching for words of comfort, the speaker in this poem happens to gaze out her window — and finds in the natural world her totem, as well as a frighteningly apt parable for endurance. Selected by Rita Dove

The muffled, ruptured voice of a friend

turns into an electrical signal and breaks open

to tell me her sister has died. A muted pause,

then a heaving. Sounds sucked from lungs.

Outside, as the sun descends to inch-high

on the fallow horizon, a hawk grasp-lands

on the telephone pole. Brawny and barrel-

chested, it perches eyeing the late winter

seed head of switchgrass. Later, we’re talking

about self-care, being strong, surviving

a long time. The hawk launches as the sun

oozes puce and ochre and sinks. I write

to another friend who says her partner

is like a hawk — steadfast, wary. I think

of the sharp-shinned hunters, the Cooper’s,

the Swainson’s, how hawks are both serene

and scary as hell, scary that is, if you’re

the mouse. That’s the trick, we say,

isn’t it? Don’t be the mouse.

      <TEXT>SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea on Saturday escalated its attempt to create a rift between South Korea and the United States, as Washington sent mixed signals over whether it would tighten or relax sanctions on the North.

Ever since the summit meeting between the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, and President Trump in Hanoi, Vietnam, late last month abruptly ended without a deal, North Korea has ceaselessly urged South Korea to distance itself from the United States and to push ahead with joint economic projects that have been held back by American-led United Nations sanctions.

North Korea’s official trade has been devastated by international sanctions imposed since 2016. The country has tried to circumvent them by importing refined fuel or exporting coal through ship-to-ship transfers on the high seas, a move banned under United Nations sanctions. It has also sought to undermine the sanctions by boosting economic cooperation with South Korea.

President Moon Jae-in of South Korea remains eager to boost inter-Korean economic ties, raising fears at home and abroad that he may steer his government away from international efforts to enforce sanctions against the North. But in reality, Mr. Moon’s hands are tied unless the United States and North Korea reach an agreement on denuclearizing the North and Washington helps to ease sanctions.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Its stock price dropped a little more than four percent on the F.D.A. news.

Last September, the Securities and Exchange Commission accused its former chief executive, Hani Zeini, of concealing damaging information about the manufacturer of its implants before closing a $60 million stock offering in 2015. The Brazilian manufacturer had had a certificate of compliance required for selling in the European Union suspended. Sientra said its issue with the S.E.C. had been resolved.

The other letter went to Mentor Worldwide, owned by Johnson &amp; Johnson and based in Irvine, Calif. The F.D.A. said the company had not enrolled enough patients in a study of its MemoryShape implant, approved in 2013, and also threatened to rescind approval for the product. Withdrawing approval for a medical device is time-consuming and rarely occurs.

Mindy Tinsley, a spokeswoman for Mentor, said the company was disappointed by the F.D.A.'s decision to issue a warning letter &quot;despite our good faith efforts to address post-approval study requirements.&quot; She said Mentor notified the FDA last year that it would fall short of study enrollment targets because of changes in consumer preferences, but did not hear back. J&amp;J’s stock remained unaffected on Tuesday.

According to the F.D.A., the other two manufacturers whose breast implants are approved in the United States are Allergan and Ideal Implant, which did not receive warning letters on Tuesday. But their implants have also drawn some illness-related complaints from women.

Plastic surgeons and implant manufacturers often say breast implants are the most intensely studied of all medical devices. But critics and patient advocates say most studies done to date are flawed.

“When plastic surgeons tell women that ‘this is the most studied medical device in the world,’ women assume that means they are proven safe,” said Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Center for Health Research in Washington, D.C., who has been advising advocates for patients with implant-related illness. But, “we still don’t know what percentage of women become seriously ill from their breast implants. We still don’t know why some women get sick right away, some get sick years later and some never get sick.”

Dr. Zuckerman, trained in psychology and epidemiology, will speak at the F.D.A. meeting next week. She wrote a 40-page analysis of breast implant studies, and found that most had not tracked long-term outcomes, or had lost too many participants. In addition, she said, the studies focused only on diseases with specific diagnoses, while ignoring symptoms like joint pain and chronic fatigue. And they were generally too small to detect rare diseases, and were funded by implant manufacturers or plastic surgery associations that had a stake in the outcomes.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>TUESDAY PUZZLE — Another fun one from Zhouqin Burnikel, and while we’ve seen this sort of theme before, I don’t remember if we’ve seen it the way she presents it.

In nontheme news, while there is a bit of glue holding the grid together, I found it to be a smooth and fun solve.

The clues are all very straightforward. The only thing that may give some younger solvers a run for their money is if they do not remember the book or TV series, “ROOTS,” and the central character, Kunta KINTE.

Also, congratulations to actress Uma THURMAN, for putting the THURMAN back in the puzzle. Before this puzzle, THURMAN had not been seen in The New York Times Crossword for more than 40 years, and it had only been clued to baseball player THURMAN Munson (Hi, kids!) One day, maybe in a late-week puzzle, I hope to see the actress’s father in the puzzle, Robert THURMAN, the linguist and Buddhist author.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Organizers of a high-profile summer tournament for world soccer’s biggest club teams have decided to keep Juventus and its star Cristiano Ronaldo away from the United States this year, eliminating the risk of the Portuguese star’s being detained by the authorities as part of a rape investigation in Las Vegas.

While the bulk of the games in the tournament, the International Champions Cup, will take place in the United States as usual, Juventus’s games will be a part of the Asian version of the annual event. Juventus will be joined there — most likely in China and Singapore — by the Premier League teams Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United.

Ronaldo, a five-time world player of the year, is in his first season in Italy’s top league after Juventus paid more than $114 million to acquire him from Real Madrid last July. Only months after his transfer, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said it had reopened an investigation into accusations by an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, who said Ronaldo raped her in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009 and later paid her $375,000 for her silence.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Chopin’s études for piano — 24 works, in two volumes — are study pieces written to develop specific aspects of technique. If you can play them comfortably, you can probably play anything written for the piano.

He tried to make these études imaginative, as well, and the best performances convey their musical riches. In that regard, Beatrice Rana set a new standard for me in her New York recital debut on Tuesday at Zankel Hall. Playing the 12 études of Book Two (Op. 25), she didn’t just surmount the technical challenges; she made the pieces sound as poetic and colorful as anything Chopin ever wrote.

Though Ms. Rana is just 26, this debut was still overdue. She has appeared for years at major halls and with leading orchestras in Europe, and has made acclaimed recordings on the Warner Classics label. In June, she will appear in Carnegie’s main hall as the soloist with the Philadelphia Orchestra in Prokofiev’s Third Piano Concerto, one of her signature works.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>This is Stephon Clark, lying on the ground, motionless after two Sacramento police officers shot him seven times. He was a 22-year-old father of two boys. An unarmed black man. Killed in his own backyard. And it all happened in just 23 seconds. We’re going to break down those 23 seconds and look at five critical moments. Our frame-by-frame analysis reveals a series of split-second decisions and errors, and examines how they ended in Clark’s death. A warning: It can be hard to watch. First, let’s play the whole encounter. Pay attention to how quickly it escalates. It all starts earlier around 9:10 p.m., when a resident calls 911 and reports that someone is vandalizing cars. Then, 16 minutes later, a police helicopter spots a suspect. This is Stephon Clark. The police footage doesn’t show Clark break a window. But the police say they believe he was responsible for the reported vandalism. Clark jumps a fence into this yard. He lived here with his grandmother, although there’s no reason to think that the police knew this. Moments later, we see two police officers approach the front of the house. Police have not confirmed the officers’ identities, so we’ll call them Officer 1 and Officer 2. The helicopter guides them toward Clark. Officer 1 has his gun drawn before he encounters Clark. We slowed down and brightened this clip to see it more clearly. This is just before the officer first shouts, starting the crucial 23 seconds as the officers begin pursuit. Clark is standing along the side of the house, while the officers are at the front. Officer 1 sees Clark and shouts. Clark runs farther into his backyard. He moves under a covered patio and stays there for the next 13 seconds. The officers chase Clark and run around a blind corner, breathing hard. Their speed may have robbed them of a chance to de-escalate the situation from a safe spot, which would be in line with their department’s instructions. The chaos of the full-on pursuit could have been a factor in the next critical moment, when one of the officers mistakenly thinks that Clark has a weapon. Officer 1 is now about 40 feet away from Clark. We’ll freeze on this frame. It’s difficult to see, but right here, this is Stephon Clark facing Officer 1. We can tell he’s stopped and facing the officer, but we can’t see much else, including whether he has anything in his hands. Here’s the moment from the helicopter’s perspective. Less than two seconds after coming around the corner, Officer 1 shouts the word “Gun.” So, why in that brief moment did the officer conclude that Clark, who was unarmed, had a gun? We don’t know. Both officers backtracked behind the corner and then looked back around it. Officer 1 again concludes that Clark is armed. And immediately after that, his partner decides to fire. Why? Possibly because he saw Clark’s movements. Remember, Clark had been stopped, but as the officers retreat, he begins moving in their direction. When they look around the corner again, he’s closer, around 25 feet away from the officers and continuing to move. Clark is stepping through a narrow space between a picnic table and the house, likely turned and not directly facing the officers. We drew this conclusion in part by comparing the body camera to this picture of Clark from earlier in the same day. Notice the pants with white stripes — the same ones seen in the body camera. But nothing in the videos can tell us why Clark moved. Overhead from the helicopter we see him as well. That small cluster of white pixels. That’s all we can see of Clark before shots are fired. Less than a second after Officer 1 called out a gun for the second time, Officer 2 fires the first series of five bullets. After a short pause, both officers shoot a combined 15 more times. Let’s look at that again from the helicopter. The first volley is fired while Clark stands. He falls to his hands and knees. He’s still moving as the second round of shots begins, and then, by the time it’s over, he’s motionless. So, which shots killed Clark? The ones fired while he was standing or those fired while he was on the ground? In early May, the Sacramento County coroner released its autopsy report, concluding that Clark was shot seven times. By combining the report with our analysis we determined that Clark was struck in his left leg while still standing, a non-lethal shot. He was also struck six more times, all on the right side and back. These shots broke his ribs, fractured his spine, lacerated his heart, perforated his lungs and killed him. Given Clark’s position, orientation and movement, these last six shots almost certainly hit Clark while he was falling or lying on the ground. We don’t know exactly how long it took these wounds to kill Clark, but we do know that there was a significant delay before any medical aid was given. “Show me your hands.” “Let’s see your hands.” After they stopped firing, the officers don’t approach Clark. They talk to either each other or to Clark’s unresponsive body, which they still consider a threat. “You all right, you hit?” “Yeah, I’m good.” Two minutes after the shooting, other officers arrive. “You can’t see his hands, right?” The police discuss using a body bunker, a shield to protect themselves from gunfire. “Three-Sam-five if you can head this way, we could use a body bunker before we detain him.” Almost three minutes after the last shot, the police identify themselves for the first time. “Hey, can you hear us?” “Police Department, can you hear us?” “We need to know if you’re OK. We need to get you medics, but we can’t go over to get you help unless we know you don’t have a weapon.” Officer 1 describes the moment when they fired. “He came up and then he, he kind of approached us hands out. And then, fell down.” Four minutes and 50 seconds after the shooting, officers approach Clark. “One of you guys want to go hands, cover ’em, I — oh, fuck.” They handcuff him, which is a standard practice. And when they roll him over, his cellphone is lying under his body. This suggests a possibility: that Clark had the phone in his hand and that’s what the officers mistook for a gun. The police now have the phone but have not said whether he was recording. “Give me a light, we’ll start CPR.” “All right.” Six minutes after the last bullet was fired, officers not involved in the shooting give first aid. Clark is pronounced dead at the scene. Officers 1 and 2 step away and mute their cameras. “Hey, mute.” We can no longer hear what they’re discussing. Shortly after the shooting, the Sacramento Police Department updated its guidelines. Officers are now required to record why they mute or turn off their cameras.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Every month, Netflix Canada adds a new batch of TV shows and movies to its library. Here are the titles we think are most interesting for April, broken down by release date. Netflix occasionally changes schedules without giving notice.

After Spike Lee kicked the studio door open with “Do the Right Thing,” the early ’90s saw a mini-wave of black filmmakers telling their own stories. None did so with more urgency than John Singleton, a recent University of Southern California grad whose debut feature, “Boyz N the Hood,” was a type of coming-of-age story that mainstream audiences had rarely seen before. A then-unknown Cuba Gooding Jr. stars as a teenager sent to live in the Crenshaw neighborhood of South-Central Los Angeles with his father (Laurence Fishburne), who teaches him the ins and outs of this difficult environment. Ice Cube and Morris Chestnut play his friends, one a Crips gang member on parole and the other a scholarship hopeful who runs afoul of the wrong crowd.

The iconoclastic German director Wim Wenders is most noted for the 1987 art house sensation “Wings of Desire,” a black-and-white fantasy about angels in Berlin, observing the spiritual struggle of the mortals below. It’s fascinating to see Wenders bring that curiosity to “Pope Francis: A Man of His Word,” a documentary profile of a pontiff who’s responsible for tending the souls of millions. Wenders’s approach is perhaps too reverential, but he gets substantial interview time with Pope Francis and deftly underscores the modest, empathetic message he’s trying to send around the world.

It took a while for Brie Larson’s directorial debut to find a home after premiering at the Toronto Film Festival in 2017, but Netflix has seized on her momentum post-“Captain Marvel,” as well as her buddy chemistry with Samuel L. Jackson, who co-stars in both films. Larson stars as a struggling artist who moves back home with her parents and takes a job at a P.R. firm as a grudging concession to adulthood. Her life changes, however, when a mystery man (Jackson) invites her to “The Store,” a place that allows her to sell whatever fantastical thing she wants. Given no restrictions, she turns to the whimsical creature she’s loved since childhood: the unicorn.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>It took New Zealand just six days to announce an immediate plan to change to the nation’s gun policy after a gunman killed 50 people at two mosques in Christchurch last week.

On Thursday, a day after the first victims were laid to rest, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced a national ban on all military-style semiautomatic weapons, all high-capacity ammunition magazines and all parts that allow weapons to be modified into the kinds of guns used in last week’s attack.

Ms. Ardern is expected to encounter little resistance in Parliament. The new law could be in place as soon as April 11.

It is unclear how the weapons ban will be felt in New Zealand, where there are plenty of guns but relatively few murders. Since 2007, gun homicides have been in the single digits every year except in 2009, when there were 11.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The script includes helpful stage direction, and it might have been nice if someone had said it out loud: “This is a theatrical séance. … We will try and fail and try again and ask for a commitment to our fellow humans sharing our air.” This at least is clarifying.

Later, the cast and a few audience members enthusiastically rip foil from Jack’s walls. (Layers and layers and layers of aluminum have silvered the space since it opened; it will all be gone by the end of the show’s run.) And Ms. Khosh delivers a more straightforward monologue, a series of questions that asks everyone to imagine the consequences of his or her death: “Will they realize your passionate love of Bach got you in trouble? Will there be a transcendent beer made in your name?” There’s a faux-naïve refrain: “Will there be hugs?”

Since Jack opened in 2012, Mr. Burke has presented several plays there. Once, he stuck actors in a spiderweb above the audience; another time, he brought in a bunch of dogs. Like “Variations on the Main,” these were theatrical experiments that never quite proved their hypotheses. But it was nice to know that New York still had spaces for the vanguard and bizarre.

And so it is nice to be at “Variations on the Main,” though it’s cutesy and too abstract, and the leaf blowers, which send foil scraps and flower petals winging through the space, are a bit much. Even in its nonsensical moments, the play asks us to be, to breathe, to think about what it means to scarf down air, together, in a space that will soon be empty of everything but air.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand — A lone white supremacist is the suspect in the Christchurch mosque killings. But under New Zealand law, many others could face charges for spreading or perhaps even possessing all or part of the 17-minute Facebook Live video streamed by the killer as he methodically shot the victims.

As of Thursday, at least two people had been charged with sharing that video via social media, under a law that forbids dissemination or possession of material depicting extreme violence and terrorism. Others could face related charges in connection with publicizing the terrorist attack, under a human-rights law that forbids incitement of racial disharmony.

While freedom of expression is a legal right in New Zealand, the parameters are more restrictive than the First Amendment guarantees in the United States. New Zealand’s Department of Internal Affairs includes a chief censor, an official who has the authority to determine what material is forbidden.

The restrictions mean New Zealanders could face legal consequences for intentionally looking at the Christchurch killer’s video, which may have been seen millions of times around the world.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Since college coaches can often recommend more athletes to the admissions department than a team needs, why not buy a few slots from the coaches and sell them to parents desperate to get their children into the most selective universities?

Perhaps the most remarkable thing about William Singer’s scheme was how easily he could have been found out. With a handful of keystrokes, or maybe a phone call, admissions officers could have discovered that applicants were simply posing as athletes.

Then it might have been discovered that a purported pole-vaulter had probably never touched a pole, that a long snapper had stopped playing football, that a supposedly fast swimmer wasn’t fast at all. Indeed, the doctored photographs used to support claims of athletic ability are pretty unconvincing.

Yet as simple as it would have been to uncover the plot, the scheme lasted at least seven years, according to the federal indictment detailing the fraud led by Singer.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>HOUSTON — The asteroid Bennu, with the shape of a spinning top, turns out to be extremely rugged. That is going to make it difficult for a NASA spacecraft, Osiris-Rex, to vacuum up a sample to take back to Earth. It was designed to collect sand and gravel, not boulders.

“We are seeing Bennu regularly eject material into outer space,” said Dante Lauretta, Osiris- Rex’ s principal investigator, during a telephone news conference on Tuesday. He and other mission scientists have been presenting their findings at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Texas. “We saw the first evidence of this in January of this year and have since observed 11 such events.”

The NASA spacecraft, which launched in 2016, entered orbit around Bennu on Dec. 31. It is not the only spacecraft from Earth exploring an asteroid. Hayabusa2, launched by Japan’s space agency in 2014, began orbiting the asteroid Ryugu last year. Its mission is also to collect samples for return to our planet for study, and members of its team were presenting findings at the Texas conference on Tuesday as well.

Both missions have found that the objects they are studying have terrain much more jagged than anticipated. But while Hayabusa2 already collected its first sample from Ryugu’s surface last month, the particles erupting from Bennu posed an additional challenge for the Osiris-Rex mission.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Re “Pelosi Says Trump Is ‘Just Not Worth’ Effort to Impeach” (news article, March 12):

Nancy Pelosi’s “he’s just not worth it ” justification against impeachment is infuriating and misses the point. For starters, yes, he is worth it. He’s destroying the fabric of our country, its heritage and its future, and enabling the amoral G.O.P. to do likewise.

But, more important, the country is worth it. The Constitution is worth it. The citizens are worth it. We deserve a country run by democratic principles, and a Congress of responsible leaders who do their job and don’t kowtow to power-grabbing demagogues. We are worth it.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s observation that any effort to impeach President Trump would not be worth it is right for several reasons: Impeachment would never pass the Republican Senate; it would be a divisive distraction from the work of throwing him out in 2020; it would provide just the sort of platform Mr. Trump would need to obfuscate and play the victim; and who wants to end up with Mike Pence?

Better to take the initiative and reframe the debate so that it’s not all about Mr. Trump but about what is good for America. Let him build a wall — around himself.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>BEIRUT, Lebanon — In tense meetings on Friday, United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pressed leaders of Lebanon to curb the growing power of Hezbollah, the political and military group supported by Iran that holds government posts and runs the health ministry.

“Lebanon and the Lebanese people face a choice: bravely move forward as an independent and proud nation or allow the dark ambitions of Iran and Hezbollah to dictate your future,” he said while standing next to the foreign minister, Gebran Bassil, after an afternoon meeting. Mr. Pompeo added that it would “take courage” for Lebanon to stand up to what he called Hezbollah’s “criminality, terror, and threats.”

Mr. Bassil, who is an ally of Hezbollah, countered Mr. Pompeo in his own post-meeting statement, saying: “For us, Hezbollah is a Lebanese party, not terrorists. Its members of parliament were elected by the Lebanese people, with high popular support.”

Mr. Pompeo’s meetings in Lebanon, which included sessions with President Michel Aoun and Prime Minister Saad Hariri, were bound to be awkward, since he had been announcing for days that his express purpose for going to Lebanon was to denounce Hezbollah and its allies in the government. It is rare for a country’s top diplomat to publicly declare that a visit is aimed at berating a government or a party within it.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>In recent years, dozens of states and municipalities have prohibited employers from asking job -candidates about prior arrests; prosecutors have moved to clear convictions for marijuana possession; and police chiefs have instructed officers to stop arresting people for low-level crimes.

A law approved in Pennsylvania last year automatically clears the records of people with misdemeanor offenses if, after 10 years, they have not been convicted of any other crime.

So far, the California proposal has raised few public objections, largely because it does not expand the range of crimes that can be sealed. Under current law, people in California can seek to have records of misdemeanors and low-level felonies sealed by making a formal request to a court; under the new legislation, sealing would happen automatically.



Under the current rules, it’s rare that people pursue sealing their records, and most don’t even know it is an option, according to George Gascón, San Francisco’s district attorney. Only about 20 percent of those eligible to get their records sealed in California actually do so. (Mr. Jordan said he was among people who didn’t know, at first, that sealing his record was an option.)

In an interview, Mr. Gascón, a Democrat, acknowledged that the legal system, including his own office, was partly responsible for the low rate. Mr. Gascón said he decided that it was critical to shift the burden away from individuals, and onto the judicial system.

“People don’t understand how it works, or they don’t have the capacity to get it done,” he said. “We cannot keep people caged in a paper prison for the rest of their lives.”

Offenses that would qualify to be automatically sealed under the new legislation are identical to those that people are permitted to seek to have sealed now, said Phil Ting, the State Assembly member, a Democrat, who introduced the bill.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>A small town in the San Francisco Bay Area is apparently unamused by improvements that one of its high-profile residents has made to a distinctive property known as the Flintstone House.

The town of Hillsborough, Calif., perhaps seeking to avoid becoming the next Bedrock, has sued its owner to force the removal of dinosaur statues, a sign reading “Yabba Dabba Doo” (the catchphrase of the animated television show’s prehistoric patriarch, Fred Flintstone) and other landscaping, according to a lawsuit filed last week in State Superior Court.

Nestled in a hilly community of about 11,000 in San Mateo County, where homes routinely sell for millions, this particular residence, with its curving lines, red and purple domes, multicolored mushrooms and scattered animal statues, has long attracted attention from neighbors (no, not the Rubbles).

One could even say it is “a page right out of history.”

But at least in its current form, officials and some residents do not to want the home, which evokes the 1960s cartoon, in their backyard. A panel of code enforcement officials last fall declared many recent renovations to the home to be a public nuisance, according to a town order, and have asked a judge to do the same. The suit alleges that the homeowner did not secure the proper permits and approvals for the changes.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Eating mushrooms may reduce the risk for mild cognitive impairment, or M.C.I., a type of memory impairment that is often a precursor of Alzheimer’s disease.

Researchers in Singapore used data on 663 Chinese men and women over 60. In one-on-one interviews, they recorded diet information, including questions about six types of commonly consumed mushrooms. They assessed cognitive function with detailed structured interviews and widely used tests of mental acuity.

After controlling for many health, behavioral and socioeconomic factors, including the consumption of meat, green vegetables, fruits and nuts, they found that compared with those who consumed less than one five-ounce portion of mushrooms a week, those who consumed one to two portions had a 43 percent reduced risk for M.C.I. People who ate more than two portions had a 52 percent reduced risk. The study is in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease.

The reasons for the association are not clear, but mushrooms contain various antioxidants that may inhibit the buildup in the brain of amyloid beta and tau, proteins that are hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease.</TEXT>

If you think technology and modern times are accelerating beyond belief, check out the seven years of the leadership of LEO V. A cursory glance makes me think this must have been a show at some point, or it’s bound to be one day.

32A: You could read this clue as moving 24 inches from someone, or as moving your two feet in different directions, which is closer to the truth, since if you get your own two feet enough apart then you DO THE SPLITS, or at least tweak a hamstring. I could see this clue being one of several involving gymnastics, or measurement puns, or even relationship endings, in a theme puzzle.

54A: “Ephemeral” is a very poetic word, and for a gardener or outdoorsperson refers to a particularly fleeting group of wildflowers that pop up, often en masse, and vanish soon thereafter, displaying one form of TRANSIENCE. I noodled over this one a bit because I think of the two words so differently, sort of spiritual (here one minute, gone the next) vs. material (moving from place to place).

2D: “Fancy” isn’t used much as a verb these days, is it? Maybe when spring rolls around again; in this puzzle, its opposite is LOATHE, as in “I loathe these small ice squalls we keep getting, but things could be worse.”

8D: There aren’t multiple Moses(es), which is where my mind went; OBOES makes perfect sense and I loved the proximity here to OBIE.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>A federal judge on Thursday dismissed a lawsuit brought against President Trump and his former lawyer by Stormy Daniels, a pornographic film actress who was paid to keep quiet about an alleged affair with Mr. Trump before the 2016 election.

The suit, brought a year ago in California, had sought to release Ms. Daniels from the nondisclosure agreement she had signed. As part of her arrangement, she received $130,000 in hush money through the president’s personal lawyer at the time, Michael D. Cohen.

As he tossed out the case this week, Judge S. James Otero, of United States District Court in Los Angeles, called the legal argument moot, given that Ms. Daniels had not been held to the terms of the agreement.

Indeed, Ms. Daniels and her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, have spoken freely about the arrangement since the filing last March. The lawsuit led to escalating national attention that culminated in Mr. Cohen’s pleading guilty to related campaign-finance crimes last summer.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>According to the complaint, a police report of the incident stated that “necessary force” was used to “safely detain” the man and that a small pocketknife fell from the man’s jacket during the altercation as he continued to resist arrest. The report also quoted the victim as saying that he was off his medication and “going through a lot.”

Although the report “purports to have been drafted” by another officer, language in it was drafted by Sergeant Fitts, who instructed another officer to sign it, prosecutors charged.

The officer who signed the report has said that he did not hear the victim make the comment about his medication and also did not see a knife fall to the ground, the complaint said.

Prosecutors said Sergeant Fitts joined the homeless services agency as a police officer in 2012 and worked there until about March 2018.

“Fitts’s alleged conduct not only betrayed his duty as an officer to protect those under his charge, but also violated the law,” Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said.

Margaret Garnett, the commissioner of the city’s investigation department, which had investigated the incident with prosecutors, added that shelters “should provide a safe environment for the homeless of our city, not one where clients fear the officers employed to protect them.”

Isaac McGinn, a spokesman for the Department of Homeless Services, said, “The actions described, including the cover-up, are horrifying and will never be tolerated in our city.” He said that working with the New York Police Department, “We remain squarely focused on improving shelter security while strengthening oversight.”

Prosecutors did not describe any injuries the man may have suffered or say what has happened to him in the two years since the incident. The government said only that he was previously a resident of the homeless agency’s facilities. The video shows that the man was ultimately brought to his feet and escorted out of the lobby.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“We’re going to move forward with our investigation into obstruction of justice, abuses of power, corruption, to defend the rule of law, which is our job,” Mr. Nadler told reporters in New York afterward. “It’s a broader mandate than the special prosecutor has. His mandate is only for crimes.”

Mr. Nadler said he rejected Mr. Trump’s claim of vindication, and zeroed in on Mr. Barr, whom he described as having prejudged the matter of obstruction.

“He auditioned for his job by writing a 19-page memorandum giving a very extreme view of obstruction of justice in presidential power and saying basically no president can commit obstruction of justice,” Mr. Nadler said, referring to a memo Mr. Barr wrote in June 2018 about executive authority. Mr. Nadler pledged to use every tool at his disposal to gain access to the full report and evidence — the public release of which Mr. Barr said Sunday raised challenges given grand jury and other sensitive information.

Mr. Nadler’s committee is not the only one scrutinizing the president and his administration. Since they took control of the House, Democrats have been investigating Mr. Trump’s businesses, his role in hush money payments during the campaign to a pornographic film actress who claimed to have had an affair with him, accusations of corruption in various federal agencies and other topics.

“I don’t know that any of our investigations depended on the red herring concept of collusion between the Trump campaign and Putin’s forces,” Representative Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat and former constitutional law professor, said in an interview, referring to a series of ongoing investigations into numerous aspects of the Trump White House and Mr. Trump’s businesses.

The collusion theory is the basis, at least in part, for the House Intelligence Committee’s own investigation of Russian election interference, and it was less clear on Sunday how Democrats leading that panel would incorporate Mr. Mueller’s definitive conclusion that there had been no conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia to undermine the 2016 election. Then again, the committee’s chairman, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, had in a sense already built in a response, framing his inquiry as not just about Russia, but any other foreign powers that could have financial or other leverage over Mr. Trump and his associates.

At least on the question of impeachment — a constitutional remedy so grave it has been pursued seriously against a president only twice in modern American history — the outlook appeared to be clearer. Mr. Nadler and Ms. Pelosi, students of the failed Republican attempt to remove Bill Clinton from office in the 1990s, have warned repeatedly that they would not go down that path unaccompanied by Republicans.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The northeastern part of the country where the epidemic has struck has been a conflict zone for decades, with more than 100 armed groups, as well as security forces posing a constant threat of violence to the population.

Distrust of outsiders is entrenched, and grew in two areas, Beni and Butembo, after the government barred residents there from voting in the long-delayed elections in December, supposedly because of concerns about the spread of Ebola. Many people thought the government had used the disease as an excuse to keep them from voting, and some of their anger turned against the outside groups that had drawn so much attention to Ebola.

Recent attacks on two treatment centers operated by Doctors Without Borders led the group to close them, and brought a scorching and highly unusual self-assessment by Dr. Liu, who included her organization among those that had fallen short. She urged medical teams to treat Ebola patients “as humans and not as a biothreat.”

She blamed not the communities, but the responders, for failing to win people’s trust.

“They hear constant advice to wash their hands, but nothing about the lack of soap and water,” Dr. Liu said. “They see their relatives sprayed with chlorine and wrapped in plastic bags, buried without ceremony. Then they see their possessions burned.”

In a piercing essay published on Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine, another physician from Doctors Without Borders, Dr. Vinh-Kim Nguyen, wrote: “Early in the epidemic, we witnessed armed agents forcibly bringing patients in for treatment. In a population already traumatized by violence and forceful responses to numerous crises, such tactics fuel distrust of responders, which prompts patients to flee and spawns violence.”

Dr. Nguyen also noted that when Ebola teams were accompanied by security forces, they were met with fear and distrust, especially of forced vaccination. But when the security forces were absent, people would actually ask to be vaccinated.

“The lesson is clear: Guns and public health don’t mix,” he wrote.

Dr. Liu said aid groups needed to offer help in ways the community would accept, even if it meant helping families to safely care for Ebola patients at home, or giving them information and equipment to carry out safe burials on their own .</TEXT>

This was the first time that humanity set foot on another world. We spent a lot of time on this scene. It’s really the culmination of everyone’s talents, from the sound design to Matt Morton’s music score. Even to this animation, which was something we decided to utilize, which is traditional cell animation. We came across that in some industrial films in NASA’s archives.” — from which point the powered descent to the lunar surface will be initiated.” “Apollo 11. Houston, we are go for undocking, over.” “The landing itself was obviously a giant technical hurdle. It involved hundreds of thousands of people, but certainly, here, the doors in mission control are closed. The three astronauts performing these complex maneuvers were very much focused on the task at hand. One of the things that we chose to utilize, not only here, but throughout the film, was the use of split screens. Here, for the first time, the two vehicles are separated, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin being on the right, and Michael Collins in the command module on the left. As we shift back into mission control, we always thought it was very important to showcase as many flight controllers interjecting as much humanity on screen as possible. So when we have these go, no go commands — “ “Go.” “GUIDO.” “Go.” “Guidance.” “Go.” “Control.” “Go.” “Telcom” “Go.” “GNC.” “Go.” “EECOM.” “Go.” “Surgeon.” “Go.” “CAPCOM — “ “These individuals were pushing the buttons to make these things happen, and we always thought that it would be important to showcase as much of these people as we could. The on-screen graphics, we spent a lot of time working with the historians — and also the astronauts, both Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin — to get that as accurate as we possibly could. Neil’s sons Rick and Mark also contributed a lot to the making of the film. And then this is one of the most famous shots in cinematic history, as far as I’m concerned. Buzz Aldrin shot this with a 16-millimeter camera out his window, and then we in the film show it as an unbroken shot to the moment of touchdown. My music composer, Matt Morton, decided to do a period score using only instrumentation that was around pre-1969. Most notably, he went out and got a 1968 edition Moog synthesizer.” [tense music]</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Perhaps Judge Ellis, a veteran of the federal bench who was appointed by Ronald Reagan, bought the argument that Mr. Manafort was being targeted to ratchet up the pressure on others as part of the broader inquiry into Russia’s actions in the 2016 presidential campaign, as his lawyers put it to Judge Ellis ahead of sentencing.

During a revealing moment early in Thursday’s hearing, Judge Ellis said Mr. Manafort was “not before this court for anything having to do with collusion with the Russian government to influence this election.” This is true. But collusion, as Judge Ellis surely knows, is not a federal crime, and it is not mentioned in the appointment order that gave Mr. Mueller his mandate in May 2017. Rather, it’s a term of art that Mr. Trump and his defenders have abused to misdirect the public about the true nature of the special counsel investigation.

Mr. Mueller, perhaps wisely, declined to make a specific sentencing recommendation for Mr. Manafort. But his office pulled no punches in laying out Mr. Manafort’s pattern of criminal conduct, his lack of remorse and his post-indictment behavior — all resulting in a revocation of his bail, new charges of obstruction of justice and the implosion of his plea agreement in a separate case, in Washington, D.C., for lying to prosecutors and the grand jury. (Mr. Manafort, who has admitted in that case to sharing polling data during the campaign with a Russian associate believed to have intelligence ties, will be sentenced in that case next week.)

“Manafort’s criminal conduct was serious, longstanding, and bold,” Mr. Mueller’s team told Judge Ellis in a sentencing submission filed last month . “He failed to pay taxes in five successive years involving more than $16 million in unreported income — and failed to identify his overseas accounts in those same returns — resulting in more than $6 million in unpaid taxes.”

To federal prosecutors, Mr. Manafort “benefited from the protections and privileges of the law and the services of his government, while cheating it and his fellow citizens.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Here comes the baseball season, which means, in more and more of the United States, here comes the baseball betting season.

In Europe, where sports betting thrives, wagering on N.F.L. and N.B.A. games has been fairly popular for years, but baseball, mostly unknown on the continent, has not made a huge impact. With the American market opening up after a Supreme Court ruling that struck down a gambling ban, baseball betting could be ready to take its place alongside hot dogs and apple pie.

So if sports betting is legal in your jurisdiction, peruse these odds and try to find a bet that will keep you in peanuts and Cracker Jack.

Sorry to bore you, but it’s the Boston Red Sox and the Yankees again. The Red Sox won 108 regular-season games and the World Series last year, losing only three postseason games. They are 6-to-1 favorites to repeat. Many bookmakers are putting the Yankees up at the same odds, and some are hedging even further by making the Houston Astros 6-1 as well. Just behind are the World Series runners-up, the Los Angeles Dodgers, at 7-1 or so.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>LONDON — Saudi Arabia’s oil company, Saudi Aramco, said on Wednesday that it would buy a 70 percent stake in a state-controlled petrochemical giant for $69.1 billion, in what appears to be an alternative to a much-delayed initial public offering.

The deal, which involves three entities controlled by the Saudi government, largely accomplishes the primary goal for Aramco’s share offering — helping to finance an ambitious campaign to modernize the kingdom.

Aramco will buy the stake in the petrochemical company, the Saudi Basic Industries Corporation, known as Sabic, currently held by the country’s sovereign wealth fund. The remaining 30 percent of Sabic will continue to be listed on Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul stock exchange.

The transaction would give Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who had been the main proponent of selling a portion of Aramco to public investors, a chunk of the cash he needs to diversify the Saudi economy, which is heavily dependent on oil. The prince hopes both to buffer the economy from oil price fluctuations and invest in industries that will provide income for the kingdom if demand for its oil wanes.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The mere mention of ceiling fans may conjure up sweltering summer days, but they can be useful at any time of year, in almost any climate.

“Even in wintertime, in a room that has a fire going, a fan on low can keep the heat circulating,” said Michael Cox, the principal of the New York interior design firm Foley &amp; Cox, who has installed them in homes from Canada to the Caribbean. “It keeps the overall temperature of the space a little more regulated.”

Unfortunately, they aren’t always aesthetically appealing — especially in recent years, as the market seems to have been flooded with clunky models.

“I compare fan design to lighting design: There’s generally a lot more bad than good,” Mr. Cox said. “It’s a bit of a needle-in-a-haystack search. But there are certainly a lot of great options out there.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>A Southern California high school that has sought to quell outrage after photographs surfaced of students giving a Nazi salute at a party is reeling again after officials say fliers with Nazi swastikas were found on campus over the weekend.

Late Saturday night or early Sunday morning “Nazi posters” were placed on the campus of the school, Newport Harbor High, a spokeswoman for the school district, Adriana Angulo, said Wednesday. School officials immediately called the Newport Beach police department to report them, Ms. Angulo said. She described the act as “vandalism.”

Officers responded to the school on Sunday morning and discovered about 10 fliers, some with Nazi symbols on them, said Heather Rangel, a spokeswoman for the police department.

“Nobody is claiming responsibility,” Ms. Rangel said Wednesday. There was no photo or video evidence for the police to review, she added. It was not clear whether the appearance of the fliers was connected to the previous episode, she said, which involved students at a party giving a Nazi salute in front of dozens of red cups arranged in the shape of a swastika.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>And one thing that was so remarkable about it, it was not just the women speaking, but it was also handlers, bodyguards and a lot of other people who were part of his life at the time who were laying out some of these very damning allegations. Now it’s important to say that R. Kelly has vehemently denied doing any of that to these women. His lawyers come out forcefully denying the allegations, and saying, basically, that all the women are not telling the truth.

I think they know that they have someone who is not going to be so quick to judge them. Because oftentimes with sexual assault, these are complicated cases. It’s not necessarily just black or white. You know, there’s relationships that start off as consensual, and then they may change. So this tricky dynamic here when you’re prosecuting sex crimes, where the facts are not always clear, where the victim may not always have the most perfect history. But I think someone like Kim Foxx, who’s kind of made that empathy that she’s had from having experienced this stuff herself, has made that kind of one of the things that she is known for and one of the things that she really puts out there. And I think that that’s going to naturally make people more comfortable that they’re going to be heard if they talk to her.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The 2020 Democratic campaign is already shaping up to be a battle of big ideas. From the Green New Deal to Medicare for All to a wealth tax, the candidates and the country are discussing bold responses to some of the greatest challenges of our times.

But when it comes to reforming our criminal legal system, the conversation hasn’t been as visionary — in fact, it’s been almost exclusively backward looking. Senators Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar are fending off criticism for actions they took as prosecutors. Should former Vice President Joe Biden enter the race, he can count on having to explain his role in championing regressive crime legislation in the 1980s and ’90s.

This scrutiny is entirely appropriate. Walk into any criminal courthouse, and you will find it packed with judges and prosecutors lecturing defendants on the importance of accepting responsibility for their choices. Come election time, the officials who built that system must accept responsibility for theirs.

But we should do more than look back. In a country that locks up more of its citizens than any other, we should demand that candidates for president have a plan for how they will confront mass incarceration and repair the harms it has caused. While most of the action in our criminal system takes place at the state and local level — almost 90 percent of prisoners are incarcerated in state, county, or local prisons or jails — the federal government still has an important role to play.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>When “Catastrophe” began in 2015, its title seemed to refer to a discrete event. Rob (Rob Delaney), an American businessman visiting London, had a whirlwind fling of marathon sex with Sharon (Sharon Horgan), who got pregnant. He stayed, they married, they bumpily transitioned from unplanned pregnancy to an unplanned life.

By the raunchy, glorious end of its fourth and final season, arriving on Amazon Friday, Rob and Sharon have been through health scares, family losses, infidelity, alcoholism and the sundry exhaustions of life with two small children. “Catastrophe,” it is clear, refers not to a single occurrence but to a state of being — the chaos of life, which this comedy depicts with deadly honest charm.

One thing that sets the series apart from other rom-coms is its maturity, which is to say, age. Rob and Sharon, both in their forties, already know themselves. They’re conscious enough of each other’s flaws to adapt, experienced enough not to expect the other to change.

Sharp-witted and outspoken, Sharon can be a bulldozer; she’s the more cynical of the two, but therefore often the more perceptive of the two. Rob’s more laid-back, but his swallowed-down stress can turn into passive-aggression. It’s also expressed itself in a drinking problem, which he had under control until the end of Season 3.</TEXT>

Mayor Bill de Blasio surprised many in the city’s political class two years ago when he broadened his push to address income inequality by promising to create 100,000 jobs in 10 years that would pay $50,000 or more per year.

“We have to drive up incomes,” Mr. de Blasio said during his State of the City address that year at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. “That means actually helping people to get the kind of jobs that allow you to afford to live in New York City — good-paying jobs.”

More than two years later, it’s unclear exactly how many of those “good-paying jobs” have been created because the city has not been keeping track.

Officials from the Economic Development Corporation, the agency charged with delivering upon the mayor’s plan, called New York Works, say it is “impractical for the city to track specific jobs created,” in documents reviewed by The New York Times.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>LONDON — Is there a better way to do public housing?

That’s the $32 billion question facing the federal monitor appointed to oversee New York City’s dysfunctional Housing Authority, fresh from its recent lead paint debacle. Estimates say the still-rising costs for repairs to all Nycha properties are now approaching the annual gross domestic product of Bahrain.

Few cities in the world face housing problems as big as New York’s. That said, New York might learn a thing or two from the East London borough of Hackney.

Hackney has been upgrading its public housing projects — or council housing estates, as the British call them. The approach entails a combination of new construction along with renovating some existing buildings, everything underwritten by the addition of market-rate apartments.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“The people that read it take it in and judge straightaway who the person is. That is where I was coming from. I was not saying they are racist. But they are fueling it for the people reading it. It is constant, and I don’t think it is fair, but who am I?”

It is an apposite question, the answer to which changed, fundamentally, that day in December. Footballer and father are the first two that come to Sterling’s mind, but it is the broader scope of who he is, and who he can be, that most engages him.

He takes inspiration from Jay-Z, someone who “made money, and then looked for the next generation, put everything in place to find someone to follow him.” He continued: “If I don’t do it, if the one after me doesn’t do it, it will just keep going. When football is finished, will I live off what I did on the field? No. I want to be able to help people be the best they can be.”

What he has realized, though, is that for him — for anyone — to have any effect, the playing field has to be level. Black success should not come with a caveat or an asterisk. That is what made him write that post. It is what made him speak up.

“I just wanted people to pause and think,” he said.

He wanted to challenge the news media to “do better.” Just as he did, he wanted those who create these images, who perpetuate the stereotypes, to look up, and to tune in.</TEXT>

She admires Captain Picard but reveres Admiral Janeway. One of her favorite things is “Shattered,” the 157th episode of “Voyager,” in which the ship goes through a temporal rift that tantalizingly splits it into different timelines.

Yes, this is Stacey Abrams, the politician who drew a great deal of national attention when she narrowly lost the race for governor of Georgia last November. Now she is mulling whether, like so many other Democrats, she wants to run for president in 2020. (Or perhaps for senator. Or maybe for governor again.)

If she does seek another office, one document likely to draw close scrutiny is her book “Lead From the Outside,” which is part memoir, part self-help book (its original title was “Minority Leader”).

In explaining her approach to politics as a black Democratic woman in a state controlled by white Republican men, she devotes several pages to a pivotal scene from “Peak Performance,” an episode from “Star Trek: The Next Generation.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, has been offered a deal that includes paying a fine and doing community service in return for admitting that if his soliciting prostitution case were to go to trial, the prosecutors would win.

The prosecutors in Palm Beach County, Fla., offered the deal to Mr. Kraft and 24 other men who last month were arrested on misdemeanor charges of buying sex at the Orchids of Asia day spa in Jupiter, Fla.

The police and prosecutors say the massage parlor is the focus of a wider investigation into human sex trafficking in several counties in Florida. Mr. Kraft — who faces two misdemeanor counts — and the other 24 men have been charged only with soliciting prostitution; they have not been charged with any crimes in connection to sex trafficking.

News of the plea offer was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.

The investigation into sex trafficking is still continuing, said Mike Edmondson, a spokesman for the state attorney’s office in Palm Beach County.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>From the whimsical skylights that protrude like reptilian eyes from its new underground art museum to the undulating walls of a new library, Helsinki’s latest attractions are resolutely cutting-edge. So it came as something of a relief, on a recent trip to the Finnish capital, to spot a homely pastry in bakery windows throughout the city. Tube-shaped and topped with a circle of ruby red jam, this is a Runeberg cake, and it’s eaten to commemorate the birthday of Finland’s national poet, Johan Runeberg, who was born on Feb. 5, 1804.

That a poet would get his own national baked good is reason enough, as far as I’m concerned, to recommend Finnish gastronomy. But happily, there are a growing number of other reasons as well. Helsinki has been slower to the Nordic revolution that has turned Copenhagen and Stockholm into global culinary destinations. But the same surge of creativity that has brought the city the Amos Rex contemporary art museum and the architecturally stunning Oodi library has extended to cuisine as well.

“When I first got here about seven years ago, there were a few fine-dining restaurants and a lot of fast food, but nothing in between,” said Barcelona-born Albert Franch Sunyer (he is a co-owner of Restaurant Nolla, which is currently closed as it rebuilds in a new location, slated to open this summer). “But I left to travel for a year in 2015, and when I came back, it was like ‘wow, what happened?’ Suddenly there were all these new kinds of places, and a younger generation of chefs starting their own businesses. Even the customers were different — they were more willing to go out.”

The innovations tend to be of degree — they exalt Finland’s limited but superlative produce and eschew luxury ingredients like shellfish and beef in favor of wild plants and offcuts of proteins — rather than kind. (In the winter, you will see a lot of root vegetables. In the spring and summer, herbs and berries.)</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Exposure to secondhand smo ke increases the risk for chronic kidney disease, a new study has found.

Korean researchers studied 131,196 nonsmokers, dividing them into three groups: those who had more than three days a week of exposure to secondhand smoke; those who had less than three days a week; and those with no exposure at all. Their average age was 53, and 75 percent were women. The study is in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology.

After controlling for age, sex, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, alcohol consumption and other health and behavioral characteristics, they found that people who had already been exposed to secondhand smoke at the start of the study had a 44 percent higher incidence of kidney disease.

The researchers followed the study volunteers for an average follow-up of almost nine years. Compared with those unexposed to secondhand smoke, people exposed up to three times a week had a 58 percent increased risk of developing renal disease, and those exposed more than three days weekly had a 62 percent increased risk.

“The dangers of secondhand smoke are obvious, not just for kidney disease but for lung cancer and cardiovascular disease as well,” said the lead author, Dr. Jung Tak Park, a nephrologist at Yonsei University in Seoul. “I’m not trying to scare people, but kidney disease is a nonreversible condition — you can’t get it fixed when renal function fails. The best approach is to reduce modifiable risks.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>People living in most parts of the United States experienced the start of daylight saving time on Sunday morning. What do you think about the ritual of pushing clocks one hour forward, and then, in autumn, moving them back one hour? Have you heard that some places are pushing to abolish daylight saving time? What are your thoughts on that? In “Daylight Saving Is Here. Suppose We Made This Time Change Our Last?,” Kirk Johnson writes:

“I cannot change the rotation of the earth and sun,” said Kansen Chu, a California lawmaker who is sponsoring a bill to keep the state permanently on daylight time — one of at least 31 states that are addressing some aspect of daylight saving and its discontents. “But I am hoping to get more sunlight to the people of California.” Proponents of setting the clock once and being done with it, like Mr. Chu, a Democrat from the San Jose area, said that shifting back and forth in the spring and fall, if it ever really made sense, no longer does. California voters agreed last fall, approving a ballot proposition for year-round daylight time by a wide margin. Lifestyles and patterns of work are different now than they were when daylight saving first became entrenched nationally during and after World War II. Research, Mr. Chu and others said, has shown that human beings just aren’t as flexible about their daily rhythms as they once seemed; accidents, heart attacks and strokes tend to occur in greater numbers around the time shift. The 1966 law allows states to opt out of daylight saving, and Hawaii and Arizona do so, staying on standard time all year; so does Puerto Rico. But for reasons that historians say remain murky, the law does not allow states to opt in all the way, and choose daylight time year-round. So the California proposal, and a similar bill passed by the Florida Legislature last year, would require an act of Congress to take effect.

Students, read the entire article, then tell us:

— How helpful, if at all, do you think daylight saving time is? To what degree is it worth the hassle of changing clocks, “losing” and later “gaining” an hour of time?

— What is the most important reason that supports your stance on either preserving or abolishing daylight saving?

— What effects do you predict ending daylight saving would have on the economy? What about people’s health? Why do you think that?

— Should there be requirements such as all states in a time zone, or adjacent to one another, reaching consensus about keeping with or breaking from daylight saving time? Or should the decision be made for the whole country?

— What are some reasons people may oppose a federal ruling about the ritual? Why might people support it?

      <TEXT>MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — The defending champion Sloane Stephens was sent packing from the Miami Open on Sunday in a 6-3 6-2 loss to Tatjana Maria in the third round.

Stephens, the 2017 United States Open champion and world No. 6, had no answer to Maria’s slices, chips and lobs and took a second consecutive early exit. She lost her first match at Indian Wells to the Swiss qualifier Stefanie Vogele.

The 31-year-old Maria, ranked 62nd in the world, celebrated prematurely on her third match point with a lob shot that was called out, but she won on the next one when Stephens sent a backhand long.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>A great table lamp can have an outsize effect on a room.

Even in a space that has been thoughtfully designed, from the carpets to the curtains, it’s often possible to point to a single element that takes it all to another level. And more often than not, “oddly, it’s the lamp,” said the interior designer Steven Gambrel.

That’s why Mr. Gambrel is always on the hunt for exceptional lamps at flea markets and antiques stores across the United States and Europe. “I love odd shapes and glazes, and I prefer lamps with height,” he said. The large-scale ones he likes, he adds, are frequently ceramic or blown glass.

Occasionally, he turns vintage finds into lamps that he uses in his projects. “Right now, I’m wiring a Japanese bronze vessel,” he said. “Sometimes we use large 19th-century glass bottles — which are great for beach houses — big, mirrored mercury-glass vessels or old apothecary jars.”

But whether a lamp is new, antique or a D.I.Y. creation, what matters is that it’s an interesting shape or color, Mr. Gambrel said: “It really helps give that extra spirit to the decorating.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The N.C.A.A. said on Saturday that it was appealing a Federal District Court’s decision this month that barring athletes from being paid beyond a scholarship and related costs violated antitrust law.

“We believe, and the Supreme Court has recognized, that N.C.A.A. member schools and conferences are best positioned to strengthen and revise their rules to better support student-athletes, rather than forcing these issues into continuous litigation,” Donald Remy, the N.C.A.A.’s chief legal officer, said in a statement.

Remy said the decision to appeal, by the N.C.A.A. and the major college conferences named as defendants in the suit, was unanimous.

The ruling this month by Judge Claudia Wilken in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California was actually far more favorable to the N.C.A.A. than the plaintiffs, a class of Division I men’s and women’s basketball players and football players, had hoped.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The league tried to have the cases thrown out, but in August 2018, an arbitrator said there was enough evidence to allow the grievances to proceed.

This would have allowed the players’ lawyers to present their cases in something akin to a trial in front of the arbitrator. They were expected to call owners and league executives as witnesses in April.

Reid returned to the N.F.L. about a month into last season, signing a one-year contract with the Carolina Panthers in September for a base salary of $823,000, far less than the $5.7 million he earned the year before with the 49ers. Reid resumed his protests and in the off-season signed a three-year extension worth about $22 million.

Reid said that the contract did not change his contention that he had been blackballed and that he still believed that owners were colluding against Kaepernick. Even though he remained out of the game, Kaepernick’s fame only grew, and his case loomed over the N.F.L.

Amnesty International gave him its Ambassador of Conscience award last spring, and as the season began, Kaepernick signed a multiyear deal with Nike that made him a face of the 30th anniversary of the sports apparel company’s “Just Do It” campaign. Kaepernick was featured on billboards and in television commercials.

His presence was also felt at the Super Bowl. Several musical artists, saying they supported Kaepernick, promised not to appear at the halftime show if invited. The league ultimately hired Maroon 5.

The league’s owners will gather for their annual meeting starting Sunday in Phoenix. At last year’s meeting, the news media focused heavily on Kaepernick’s absence and on the N.F.L.’s position on whether players should be required to stand on the field for the anthem.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“The sale of submarines, or to give permission to sell submarines to a neighboring state, this is not a special operation in the middle of the night,” he told reporters. “This is going to affect us for many years to come, and it cannot but take place through the formal channels.”

“It makes no sense,” he added. “Why do we have a National Security Council? Why do we have a Ministry of Defense? Why do we have a Ministry of Foreign Affairs? Why do we have so many official committees, if it comes to one of our most important strategic decisions, and we bypass them all by cousins and lawyers?”

This was not the story line Mr. Netanyahu was aiming for as he headed to Washington. His trip had been carefully orchestrated to remind Israelis, who overwhelmingly admire Mr. Trump, of how effectively Mr. Netanyahu has managed their relationship. At their Monday meeting, Mr. Trump is expected to sign a document formalizing the United States’ recognition of Israel’s sovereignty in the Golan Heights — a strategically important plateau that Israel captured from Syria in the Arab-Israeli War of 1967 but which under international law is considered occupied territory.

As an added bonus, the White House meeting is to take place on the same morning that Mr. Gantz takes the stage across Washington at the annual gathering of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, ensuring that Mr. Gantz’s big debut there is utterly eclipsed.

Mr. Netanyahu’s early departure means that he will abandon plans to take his turn addressing the Aipac meeting on Tuesday, and he will miss talks with congressional leaders and a dinner at the White House with Mr. Trump.

The Aipac appearance, a yearly ritual for Mr. Netanyahu at which he is accustomed to bathing in the applause of thousands of approving supporters of Israel, had threatened to expose him to some embarrassment. Aipac departed from its studious avoidance of internal Israeli politics recently, after Mr. Netanyahu brokered a deal to bring a racist right-wing party into the government if he is re-elected, by calling the party “reprehensible.”

Liberal Jews who object to Mr. Netanyahu’s policies and who are concerned that Israel is becoming a partisan issue in the United States, had been pointing to his appearance as a chance to protest. T’ruah, a rabbinical human-rights advocacy group, urged Jews attending the Aipac conference to walk out on Mr. Netanyahu’s speech, while a prominent rabbi, Rachel Timoner of Congregation Beth Elohim in Brooklyn, on Friday called on Democratic leaders to “sound the alarm against” Mr. Netanyahu’s policies from the Aipac stage.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“I’m able to walk, a little bit slower, but I’ll be all right,” Lowry said.

Mitchell Robinson, the Knicks’ rookie center, collided with Lowry while chasing a loose ball in the third quarter. Robinson fell onto Lowry’s legs, taking him down from behind. Lowry slapped the floor in pain and frustration before being helped to his feet and limping to the locker room.

“I watched the clip,” Lowry said. “I think it was a little bit dirty. He grabbed me and pulled me down. I don’t think he did it on purpose. I know he didn’t think he was going to hurt me.”

Robinson, who fouled out with no points in 14 minutes, did not speak to reporters.

Marc Gasol had 12 points and 11 rebounds, Pascal Siakam scored 19 points and OG Anunoby had 14 as Toronto reached 50 wins for the fourth straight season.

Allonzo Trier scored 22 points for the Knicks and Kevin Knox had 12. The loss came one day after Mario Hezona’s last-second block gave the team a 124-123 home win over LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers. The Knicks, who have the worst record in the N.B.A. at 14-57, lost for the ninth time in 10 games.

“Toronto is going to be in that mix at the end,” Knicks Coach David Fizdale said. “They’ve got all the ingredients to go after this thing. We took one on the chin tonight.”</TEXT>

Mr. Udall, 70, the scion of a political dynasty that helped define the modern Democratic Party in the West, explained his decision in an online message, writing that he believed he could be more productive over the next two years without the pressures of seeking re-election.

“Without the distraction of another campaign, I can get so much more done to help reverse the damage done to our planet, end the scourge of war, and to stop this president’s assault on our democracy and our communities,” Mr. Udall wrote on Medium.

Mr. Udall joins two senior Republicans, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Pat Roberts of Kansas, in his plans to retire at the end of the current Congress.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Her first priority included increasing nurseries and day care for children, she said. Paternity leave came later. “My basic idea was that men and women should share rights and duties. The idea is that men should be real parents.”

Even with their increased clout, Swedish women still face many barriers, at work and at home. “Is the Last Mile the Longest” was the question posed in the title of a May 2018 report on “Economic Gains From Gender Equality in Nordic Countries,” by the O.E.C.D. The report concluded that while the Scandinavian countries have come closer than other countries to narrowing the gender gap, the challenge to closing it altogether remains stubbornly difficult.

In recent years, some have argued that Sweden’s reputation as the best in the class on gender equality has slipped. In 2007, Sweden ranked No. 1 on the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report; now it is in third place. Many fathers still resist taking an equal share of the generous 480 days of parental leave provided at the birth of a child, leaving mothers to assume the greater responsibility for child care and house work, studies show. The wage gap between men and women is still there (women get 88 percent of men’s wages) and in 2016, only 6 percent of chief executive positions in listed companies where held by women and 5 percent of board chairmanships.

“We still have a lot to do,” said Ms. Lindhagen, who has set efforts to combat domestic violence and to increase women’s economic power as her top priorities as a member of Sweden’s new coalition government.

Sweden has resisted the move to legislate the kind of quotas for women in top corporate positions adopted in neighboring Norway in 2003, followed later by France, the Netherlands and Spain. Ms. Lindhagen said the emphasis still should be on improving working conditions so that women can thrive and be promoted. “Then if it isn’t happening, if it is taking too long, then I could say we should look at quotas,” she said.

Voluntary quotas for women candidates were adopted over the years by Sweden’s political parties, but according to Ms. Dahl, the important work was done before quotas. “First we laid the groundwork to facilitate women’s entry into politics,” she said in a 1998 report on women in politics by International IDEA, a Swedish foundation. “We prepared the women to ensure they were competent, and we prepared the system, which made it a little less shameful for the men to step aside.”

But numbers don’t tell the whole story. In France, where the president, Emmanuel Macron, in 2017 named a cabinet divided equally between men and women, journalists and other observers note that the top staff in the ministries, and in the presidency itself, are male dominated.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The City of New York announced on Monday that $2.8 million it had received as a result of allowing the Metropolitan Museum of Art to change its admissions policy would be allocated to more than 175 other cultural organizations.

Among the institutions that will benefit are El Museo del Barrio, the Studio Museum in Harlem and the Bronx Museum of the Arts.

“This agreement with the Met has paid dividends for NYC’s cultural community,” said the city’s cultural affairs commissioner, Tom Finkelpearl, adding that the arrangement was “stabilizing one of our city’s major institutions with increased admissions revenue, while providing a much-needed boost to organizations that anchor communities across the city.”

In 2018 the Met was allowed to change its pay-what-you-wish policy of 48 years to require that visitors from outside New York State pay $25. The change came at the behest of museum officials who were concerned about revenue.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>If Clinton had matched this cultural conservatism with decency in his private life, Al Gore would have won re-election as his heir and the larger story of the center-left might have been entirely different. But instead, from the mid-2000s onward, the leftward flank of the Democratic Party looked at the country’s changing demographics and growing social liberalism and decided that Clinton’s compromises with cultural conservatism weren’t as politically necessary as they had been (which was true), and that therefore they were free to become increasingly ideologically maximalist on everything touching gender or race or sexuality or immigration (which was … not true).

In this sense the story of the Democrats’ struggles over the last 15 years is a story of a party that has consistently moved leftward faster than the also-changing country, and consistently overread victories — on same-sex marriage above all — as a template for how every cultural battle should play out. It’s a story of a new feminism that’s pushing the party ever-further from the center on abortion, of a new cohort of white liberals who are actually to the left of many African-Americans on racial issues, of an activist base that brands positions that many liberals held only yesterday as not only mistaken but bigoted or racist or beyond-the-pale.

And in this part of the Democratic coalition’s story, the center-left’s role has been extraordinarily passive, essentially following the cultural left a tiny bit more slowly rather than trying to devise a more moderate approach. You can find hints of what such a moderate approach might look like in intellectual projects like Jonathan Haidt’s Heterodox Academy, or in the probing, evenhanded culture-war reportage of the magazine writer Jesse Singal (whom I hesitate to even praise because it will do him no favors on the internet). But that cultural moderation has no substantial political form, no important champions within the Democratic Party. It has Joe Manchin and Tulsi Gabbard, maybe, but they are eccentric figures; elsewhere among the Democrats there is little interest in considering all the different ways that cultural extremism costs them votes.

Which means that if the center-left abdicates, DeLong-style, on economic policy, the Democratic Party as a whole will have moved to the left on every front, writing off not only the possibility of compromising with Republican politicians (which, for now, might be understandable) but also the possibility of winning over voters who would almost certainly be Democrats if the party still occupied the cultural terrain that it held in 2000 or even as late as 2008.

Because the country as a whole has also shifted left since 2000, that kind of writing-off will not prevent the Democrats from winning elections; it probably won’t prevent them from beating Donald Trump. But it will stand in the way of any dramatic left-of-center consolidation, any kind of more-than-temporary Democratic governance. And if the center-left feels itself irrelevant in an age of socialist ambition, then taking up the task of rebuilding a cultural center, and a Democratic Party capable of claiming it, seems like the task that might actually be suited to the times.

Sadly the rest of the DeLong thread didn’t take up that possibility. It degenerated, instead, into a howl against Republican fascism and a post-Protestant sermon about how liberal America can build the true and only heaven, the real shining city on the hill.

Which suggests that to reckon with the possibility that making liberalism a pseudo-church might be a problem, not an aspiration, we need a very different center-left from the one surrendering today.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Gail Collins is right: Some days it really does feel as if robocalls have taken over the world (“Let’s Destroy Robocalls,” column, March 2). Illegal calls that scam consumers are a major problem, and it will take sustained cooperation between government and industry to turn the tide.

Here’s what USTelecom and carriers are doing today:

First, we’re working with law enforcement to trace back, track down and bring illegal robocallers to justice. The Federal Communications Commission says we have cut the time to conduct an investigation from months to weeks.

Second, we’re rolling out consumer tools (a 495 percent increase in apps since 2016) and using new call validation standards to restore trust in caller ID.

There is no silver bullet, but with innovators and government joining forces, soon it won’t feel as if the robocallers have won.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Paul George has a small freshwater pond behind his house in Oklahoma City that he stocks with bass, crappie and bluegill. Whenever he has a couple of hours to spare from his responsibilities as a do-everything forward for the N.B.A.’s Thunder, he heads out back with his fishing rod. He releases what he catches — for now, anyway.

“Waiting for them to get a little bigger,” he said.

George has time. Last summer, on the first night of free agency, he agreed to re-sign with the Thunder on a four-year, $137 million deal. The news emanated from a house party that Russell Westbrook, his superstar teammate, was hosting for George, who did not even entertain meetings with rival teams. He was sticking with the Thunder.

In doing so, George made clear that he was banking on his partnership with Westbrook while offering endorsements of the organization and of Oklahoma City’s leisurely pace. He can fish. He can raise his two young children in a quiet neighborhood. And he can focus on basketball, knowing that his future is with the Thunder.

“You can give your everything to one organization, and you know the direction that you’re going,” George said in a recent interview. “There’s so much that players have to deal with that I don’t think people quite recognize. A lot of them are the same issues that everybody else deals with. But this takes a lot of the burden off my shoulders.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>In an email sent the day Mr. Giuliani was named as Mr. Trump’s lawyer, Mr. Costello told Mr. Cohen, “I am sure you saw the news that Rudy is joining the Trump legal team.” He added that he had told Mr. Cohen about his “relationship with Rudy, which could be very very useful for you.” Mr. Cohen wrote back, in part saying, “Great news.”

Within a day, Mr. Costello spoke by phone with Mr. Giuliani to tell him that Mr. Cohen was planning to hire Mr. Costello’s law firm. Soon after that call, Mr. Costello emailed Mr. Cohen to say, “Rudy was thrilled and said this could not be a better situation for the President or you,” noting that Mr. Giuliani knew and trusted Mr. Costello. Mr. Giuliani, he added, “said thank you for opening this back channel of communication.”

Later the same weekend, Mr. Costello sent the email about “friends in high places.” Those two emails were first reported by CNN.

The Times reported last week that Mr. Cohen had described to the prosecutors how Mr. Costello had spoken with Mr. Giuliani. Mr. Costello declined to comment at the time, citing attorney-client privilege, but has since learned that Mr. Cohen waived the privilege, freeing him to discuss his experience with Mr. Cohen.

In the interview, Mr. Costello accused Mr. Cohen of smearing him to the prosecutors as part of a bid to reduce his sentence. He also said that Mr. Cohen repeatedly told him that he had committed no crimes and misled Mr. Costello’s law firm about his intentions to hire them.

“Cohen lied to us from day one,” Mr. Costello said, adding that neither he nor Mr. Giuliani dangled a pardon in front of Mr. Cohen.

A lawyer for Mr. Cohen, Lanny J. Davis, said he could not comment on the documents requested by prosecutors, but suggested it was “impossible to deny or try to spin your way out of what documents say.” He added that Mr. Cohen had clarified his testimony about pardons in a letter to the House committee this week, and that Mr. Cohen stood by his statement to the committee about not having sought a pardon. Mr. Davis said after the testimony that Mr. Cohen had inquired about Mr. Trump’s intentions after the president’s legal team “dangled” the possibility of pardons.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>MOSCOW — The chief of Russia’s armed forces endorsed on Saturday the kind of tactics used by his country to intervene abroad, repeating a philosophy of so-called hybrid war that has earned him notoriety in the West, especially among American officials who have accused Russia of election meddling in 2016.

At a conference on the future of Russian military strategy, Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov, the chief of the general staff, said countries bring a blend of political, economic and military power to bear against adversaries.

The speech outlined what some Western analysts consider the signature strategy of Russia under President Vladimir V. Putin — and what other experts call a simple recognition of modern war and politics.

General Gerasimov said Russia’s armed forces must maintain both “classical” and “asymmetrical” potential, using jargon for the mix of combat, intelligence and propaganda tools that the Kremlin has deployed in conflicts such as Syria and Ukraine.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>To escape the shadow of Francoism once and for all will ultimately require a clean break from Madrid, he said.

“We had a dictatorship for 40 years, but we had no Nuremberg process,” said Mr. Rufián. “The so-called transition was a lie.”

But within the establishment left, this is an extreme view.

A more favorable interpretation highlights how the Socialist party, which was banned under Franco, has held power more than any other party since his death.

By 2008, the head of the armed forces was a general who was openly leftist. And if senior judges have made politicized decisions, it is because they have been appointed by parliaments and governments from both the left and right.

Thanks to the transition and the Constitution, Spain has become one of “the most tolerant societies in the world,” said José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, the Socialist prime minister between 2004 and 2011.

Today’s impasse, he said, is instead the result of stubbornness by both the separatists, who have not admitted to mistakes, and the center-right government that was in power during the 2017 secession attempt.

For its own political reasons, it seemed ‘‘to be more delighted with confrontation than with an honest recognition of the diversity of Spain,” Mr. Zapatero said.

The only solution, he added, was “coexistence, which implies recognition and respect, and there is only one way to achieve it — the political dialogue, which requires more courage than confrontation.”</TEXT>

With New York State facing one of its most severe measles outbreaks in decades, public health officials in a suburban community took the extraordinary step in December of banning unvaccinated students from attending school, regardless of whether they had received religious or medical exemptions for the vaccine.

The parents of 42 children affected by the ban at the school, the Green Meadow Waldorf School, sued the Rockland County health department, asking a federal judge to issue an injunction to allow the children to return.

On Tuesday, the request was denied.

In a hearing at Federal District Court in White Plains, Judge Vincent Bricetti said the parents failed to prove “that public interest weighs in favor of granting an injunction,” according to The Journal News.

“While no one enjoys the fact that these kids are out of school these orders have worked,” the county’s attorney, Thomas E. Humbach, said in a statement about the decision. “They have helped prevent the measles outbreak from spreading to this school population.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Mr. Shanahan did not give a timeline for his review, saying only that it would end soon.

In May, United States Africa Command finished an initial investigation into the ambush and found widespread problems across the military operation. That inquiry focused mostly on the actions of junior officers before an hourslong gun battle against dozens of Islamic State militants.

A separate investigation, by Special Operations Command, has been in limbo as high-ranking Defense Department officials have been divided on its outcome. It largely sought to overhaul training protocols but also designated soldiers for awards for valor and for punishments.

In December, before he left the Pentagon, Mr. Mattis criticized Defense Department officials for the length of the investigation and the fact that most of the resulting punishments were issued against junior officers with relatively little experience.

The Army has since punished officers and enlisted soldiers who were involved in the battle at nearly every level of command, like a captain, who was the Green Beret team leader in the ambush, and the two-star general who oversaw all Special Operations Forces in Africa. The punishments focused primarily on training failures that led up to the attack on Oct. 4, 2017.

Col. Bradley D. Moses, then the commander of the Third Special Forces Group, is the one of the only people in the Special Operations chain of command involved in the ambush who remains unpunished.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“I don’t swim very well and I had not swum in a long time so I was afraid,” said Mr. Mohammed, recalling how he felt as their small craft pushed off.

The first person they helped was a man, then farther out in the river was a young girl. “We pulled her out of the water,” Mr. Mohammed said, but she was very cold and feeling sick from swallowing “all the dirty things from the river.”

“I felt I did something good, but I feel sorry for everyone else,” he said. “The current was really strong; there were a lot of people going by us, and we didn’t have enough time to pick up others. The river took them.”

Mosul was occupied by the Islamic State for nearly four years until late 2017, when the extremists were defeated by a punishing air and ground fight that left the city shattered. The gradual return of small pleasures and holiday celebrations has been a balm to the battered population and has helped bring back a sense of normalcy, making the deadly river accident seem especially unjust.

Celebrating the Kurdish New Year, known as Nowruz, dates to 1700 B.C. and incorporates Zoroastrian traditions in a celebration of spring. In Kurdistan on the first day of Nowruz, which is celebrated on March 19, Kurds light fires outdoors that they say are meant to symbolize the last fire of winter.

Also known as the Persian New Year, it is celebrated across the territory that once made up the ancient Persian Empire, from the Middle East to Central Asia, and is enjoyed by many people who are of neither Kurdish nor Persian backgrounds.

Although the days are still cool in northern Iraq, Thursday was sunny and people flocked to picnic outdoors. Among them was Mohammed Alwan, 28, who went with a friend to the riverbank to celebrate the holiday.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>LONDON — Britain’s immigration department has been condemned for citing violent Bible passages as the basis to reject an asylum claim by an Iranian national who said he had converted to Christianity because it was a “peaceful” religion.

The Home Office — which is responsible for handling immigration, security and law and order — used verses from the books of Leviticus, Exodus and Revelation in an attempt to argue that Christianity was hardly “peaceful.” The asylum seeker’s application was denied on Tuesday, according to the man’s legal representative, who shared details on social media.

The case drew a rebuke from the Church of England, and immigration advocates denounced the decision as another example of the Home Office’s harsh methods.

The man, who has not been identified and had converted from Islam, filed the claim in 2016, the immigration caseworker and legal representative, Nathan Stevens, wrote on Twitter. It was not clear whether the man had made his conversion a basis for his claim.</TEXT>

The Senate voted on Thursday to reject President Trump’s executive order declaring a national emergency at the border and redirecting funds for his wall, seconding the House’s vote last month and setting up a showdown with the president. Trump immediately tweeted “VETO!” afterward — and indeed, the 59-vote Senate majority that overturned his order would not be enough to override a presidential veto.

That said, the vote represented a historic — and humbling — rejection of the president. And Stephen Colbert was more than ready to rub it in, rattling off a short list of Trump’s other unfortunate “presidential firsts.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Last week’s story on the statements made by Representative Ilhan Omar, and the Democrats’ response to them, clearly resonated with readers. We got over 100 emails, covering views on all sides of the issue and coming from across the country (and even a few from around the globe).

Some readers felt that Ms. Omar’s statements, regardless of possible anti-Semitism, addressed an issue that is in dire need of serious political debate.

I am horrified that the moderate, older Dems wanted to rebuke Ms. Omar. Her comments were perhaps ill-advised, but why should she be singled out when comments made by other public figures are much more ugly and yet are let slide? People of different generations were raised with completely differing views of Israel — my generation, the baby boomers, were taught to revere the strong new state of Israel, while people now in their 20s and 30s see the damage Israel is causing the Palestinians. Ms. Omar is of that generation and also an immigrant, and must be given some slack. Above all her First Amendment rights must NOT be trampled by Democrats!

Here is an 85-year-old Jew who strongly supports Ms. Omar, and who agrees with her that the Israeli and Aipac policies are racist and anti-Arab. If Aipac was not so cash heavy, Congress would judge its policy on the merits, and it would have little weight; and, likewise, Israeli discriminatory policy towards its Arab citizens and neighbors would merit criticism and not acceptance. At my age I witnessed the Nazi policy of murder toward Jews and I had hoped that the Jewish state would know, as no one else, how wrong and muddle headed those policies were. Alas, the Jewish state seems to have learned little from the far-to-recent past.

Many others felt that Ms. Omar’s statements were plainly anti-Semitic, and that the Democratic reaction was not strong enough.

Passing a resolution condemning “all hate” in response to a specific instance of pointed anti-Semitism, especially in the midst of an undeniable and disturbing upswing in anti-Semitic attacks both globally and nationally, is like passing a resolution that “all lives matter” in response to police violence against black men; it says the exact opposite of what it purports to say.

As a lifelong Democrat, I was upset at Ilhan Omar’s blatantly anti-Semitic, age-old canard about Jewish people having loyalty to another country. And I am equally upset at my party cowering to an increasingly tyrannical minority and failing to pass a specific resolution to a specific comment. Does not Congresswoman Omar know about Goebbels and his usage of propaganda such as “the insidious international Jewish financiers,” or the danger of “Jewish penetration of law, medicine, property, and the arts.” Has she not studied history and the power of the spoken word on a national platform? No bigotry should ever come close to being tolerated. Nor should hesitancy in unequivocally condemning a specific outburst of bigotry such as displayed by Congresswoman Omar ever be tolerated as well.

And then there were those whose concerns were not the content of Ms. Omar’s statements, but the political fallout that they could have.

I applaud the enthusiasm of the congressional “newbies.” However, I say to each of them, be guided by this reality: you don’t know everything, you can’t do everything, especially all at once. You are the new kids on the block. You each need to learn how to be an effective legislator, how to communicate, how to work with other legislators, even those with whom you often disagree. Succeeding in Congress may require compromise, even with those you don’t like.

      <TEXT>SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea acknowledged for the first time on Friday that the summit meeting last week between its leader, Kim Jong-un, and President Trump ended without an agreement, claiming that people “in and outside” the North were blaming the United States for the breakdown.

Until now, North Korea’s state news media had not reported the collapse of the summit meeting, held in Hanoi, Vietnam, on Feb. 27 and 28. The failed summit was considered a big embarrassment for Mr. Kim because he had to return home empty-handed after Mr. Trump rejected his demand for relief from United Nations sanctions.

“People in and outside the North had hoped that the second North Korea-United States summit meeting, held in Hanoi, would yield good results,” the Rodong Sinmun, the newspaper published by the North’s ruling Workers’ Party, said in a commentary on Friday. “After it unexpectedly ended without an agreement, they are letting out sighs of regret, all arguing that the United States was responsible.”

But the commentary also said that “the whole world sincerely hopes that the peace process on the Korean Peninsula will proceed smoothly and the North Korea-United States relations will improve soon.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Dr. Amy Wechsler, a dermatologist on the Upper East Side who does laser hair removal, said that it’s a commonly booked service in her practice with preteen girls.

This phenomenon is the opposite of the movement among millennial women, who often embrace their body hair, sometimes dyeing the hair on their underarms, according to Olivia Guinaugh, a home and personal care analyst at the research firm Mintel. In a 2018 survey, the company found that 25 percent of women between the ages of 18 and 34 agreed that it was acceptable to have visible underarm hair, compared with 5 percent of women who were 55 or older. “The millennial generation is all about female empowerment and embracing #MeToo, and being O.K. with body hair is part of that,” Ms. Guinaugh said.

Emeral Eden, 25, an Atlanta resident who posts videos about body positivity on her YouTube channel, dyes her underarm hair in bold colors such as green and pink. She was hairy during elementary school, she said, and was bullied relentlessly because of it. “I used to get called werewolf and shaved my underarms every day until I realized that I couldn’t change myself to please others,” she said. “If it’s not your body hair, people will find something else to pick on.”

Not everyone sees it that way. Wendy Nash, a child psychiatrist at the Child Mind Institute in New York, said that she and her colleagues frequently work with prepubescent girls who are bothered by their body hair and have been mocked because of it, either at school or by their siblings. She also has appointments with parents who are conflicted about taking their young daughters to have their hair lasered or waxed.

“It’s a topic that’s coming up with younger and younger girls, partly because of the rise of social media and partly because puberty is happening earlier,” she said. “It’s not unusual today for an 8-year-old girl to have arm hair.”

Dr. Wechsler said that young girls who have had laser treatments tend to view themselves in a more positive light. “Facial hair can negatively impact their lives, and it improves their self-esteem to have it taken off,” she said.

That was the case for Lily Levin, 16, who lives in Marietta, Ga. When she turned 14, she noticed that the dark hairs on her chin, the sides of her face and her upper lip were visible against her pale skin. Although she hadn’t been teased about it, she fretted that she would become a target. Lily asked her mother, Ilene, if she could have it removed. She didn’t think twice about saying yes.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Citizen science travel, or trips where the traveler is encouraged to participate in scientific research through observation and data collection, is growing in popularity thanks in part to an increasing number of ecotourists who want to support research initiatives around the world. These travelers also want to contribute positively to the destinations they visit.

The environmental charity Earthwatch has been sending volunteers on research trips for nearly fifty years, with tours focusing on climate change, ocean health, wildlife and ecosystems. Ecotourists collect and analyze environmental data that is used in the hope of advancing conservation efforts on a global scale.

“We’ve seen a 20 percent rise in participation over the past five years,” said Scott Kania, Earthwatch’s chief executive. “Citizen science offers people the opportunity to own ecological problems and be a part of the solution.”

According to a 2017 Earthwatch report, scientists and participants have discovered new species and gathered data that have been influential in establishing nature reserves and protecting endangered wildlife, like leatherback sea turtles in Costa Rica. The firm’s latest expedition takes citizen scientists to Peru on a weeklong journey to photograph, measure and collect genetic samples of giant manta rays with the goal to help halt overfishing.

Earthwatch’s Peruvian expedition is $2,750 per person, and includes room and board, research permits, scientific equipment, airport and land transfers, and medevac insurance for the duration of the expedition.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Okwui Enwezor, an influential Nigerian curator whose large-scale exhibitions displaced European and American art from its central position as he forged a new approach to art for a global age, died on Friday in Munich. He was 55.

The cause was cancer, said his partner, Louise Neri.

In ambitious, erudite, carefully argued exhibitions staged in Europe, Africa, Asia and the United States, Mr. Enwezor (pronounced en-WEH-zore) presented contemporary art against a backdrop of world history and cultural exchange.

His 2002 edition of Documenta, an important exhibition that occurs once every five years in Kassel, Germany, stands as a major achievement in recent art history. Though earlier shows like “Magiciens de la Terre” (Paris, 1989) had begun to tell a worldwide story of art, the 2002 Documenta was a testament to how widely Mr. Enwezor was enlarging art world horizons and positioning artists of the 20th century avant-garde as just a few actors in a vast ebb and flow of world civilization.

Many of his most acclaimed shows were group exhibitions and biennials. In addition to Documenta, he curated the 2008 Gwangju Biennale in South Korea, the 2012 Paris Triennale and the 2015 Venice Biennale. Yet Mr. Enwezor also curated numerous solo exhibitions, by such figures as the South African photographer David Goldblatt and the American sculptor and filmmaker Matthew Barney.</TEXT>

Listeners have come to expect it. Lots of it.

Audio of real-world events as they unfold. Press conferences. Speeches. Newsreel. Archival recordings.

It’s woven into almost every episode of “The Daily” to transport listeners to a time or a place, to create urgency and immediacy.

Here’s an example from Friday’s episode about Michael Jackson. Our guest, the Times culture critic and “Still Processing” co-host Wesley Morris, introduces the film “Leaving Neverland,” and tape begins to weave in and out around him.

Michael: What do we need to talk about this week? Tape: Not a trailer or even a single clip of this new documentary has been released ahead of its debut today, but that has not slowed the buzz behind it. Wesley: I became aware of this movie as it was making its way towards Sundance in January. Tape: It’s probably right now the most talked-about film at Sundance.

What’s the point of tape like that? There are a few explanations. First, it alleviates the burden of the guest having to tell the entire story him- or herself. I could listen to Wesley talk all day, but it’s a lot to ask him to deliver every detail of a complex tale. Tape is the ultimate storytelling sidekick. Here, the tape does the work of explaining how much the world awaited this film — or dreaded its arrival. Second, the tape deepens our understanding of the reaction and impact around it. There really were protests over “Leaving Neverland” at the Sundance Film Festival. Don’t take our word for it. The tape brings you there.

Every week, producers spend hours hunting for the perfect tape, diving into old archives, watching congressional hearings on C-Span. We’re an obsessive bunch.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>That sounds great, but I realized I had a big problem. For the most part the highly recommended foods, like cheese danishes, were ones I really disliked, while those rated C-, like oatmeal, melon and baked squash, were typically among my favorites. Bratwurst (the worst and potentially most lethal kind of food in my perception) was rated an A+! If I wanted to avoid glucose spikes, I’d have to make some pretty big sacrifices in my diet.

Nevertheless, it was an interesting first step on the path to a personalized diet. There is now a commercial version of this test, based on the research of Dr. Segal and Dr. Elinav, though it is much more limited: It only analyzes a gut microbiome sample, without monitoring glucose or what you eat.

There are other efforts underway in the field as well. In some continuing nutrition studies, smartphone photos of participants’ plates of food are being processed by deep learning, another subtype of A.I., to accurately determine what they are eating. This avoids the hassle of manually logging in the data and the use of unreliable food diaries (as long as participants remember to take the picture).

But that is a single type of data. What we really need to do is pull in multiple types of data — activity, sleep, level of stress, medications, genome, microbiome and glucose — from multiple devices, like skin patches and smartwatches. With advanced algorithms, this is eminently doable. In the next few years, you could have a virtual health coach that is deep learning about your relevant health metrics and providing you with customized dietary recommendations.

The benefits of such a coach will, of course, have to be validated by randomized trials, unlike the myriad diets that are being hawked without any proof that they are effective or even safe.

We don’t often think of a diet as being unsafe, but the wrong foods can be dangerous for people with certain risks or conditions. I’ve had two bouts of kidney stones. To avoid a third, I need to stay away from foods high in oxalate, a naturally occurring molecule abundant in plants. But if you look at the recommendations for my personalized diet, many — like nuts and strawberries — are high in oxalate. That’s a big miscue, because my pre-existing medical conditions were not one of the test’s inputs. And as we undergo significant changes through our lives, like pregnancy or aging, we’ll need re-assessments of what our optimal diet should be.

For now, it’s striking that it took big data and A.I. to reboot our perceptions about something as fundamental as what we eat. We’re still a ways away from “You Paleo, me Keto,” but at least we’re finally making progress, learning that there is no such thing as a universal diet.

      <TEXT>HONG KONG — Before she went on holiday with her boyfriend, the young woman from Hong Kong told friends about his pledge to her. “He said I am his first and last girlfriend,” the woman, Poon Hiu-wing, 20, wrote on Facebook. It would be her last Facebook post.

After their trip to Taiwan in February 2018, the boyfriend, Chan Tong-kai, returned alone. Her family grew worried and called the police. One week later, investigators found her body in the bushes near a light rail station in northern Taiwan. An autopsy determined that she had been four to five months pregnant.

The police in Hong Kong arrested Mr. Chan, and last year he was charged over possession of his girlfriend’s cellphone, digital camera and $3,000 in cash.

But he was not charged with killing Ms. Poon.

Under Hong Kong law, Mr. Chan must face charges related to her death where it happened, in Taiwan. But Hong Kong does not have an extradition agreement with Taiwan, so Mr. Chan has remained in Hong Kong.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Of the four Mets coaches in 1969 — above from left, Yogi Berra, Rube Walker, Eddie Yost and Joe Pignatano — only Pignatano, who will turn 90 in August, is still alive. In 1969, Pignatano was the coach in the bullpen, where he found room for a vegetable garden. Berra was the first-base coach and succeeded Hodges as Mets manager when Hodges died; Berra died in 2015 at age 90. Rube Walker was the Mets’ pitching coach and died in 1992 at age 66. Eddie Yost was the third-base coach and died in 2012 at age 86.

Jack DiLauro was a jack-of-all-trades pitcher for the Mets in 1969, the only season he played with the team. He appeared in 23 games, made 4 starts, and went 1-4. He was not on the postseason roster and there is no official baseball card showing him as a Met. Other players — Donn Clendenon (acquired in June) and Bobby Pfeil, Wayne Garrett and Rod Gaspar (rookies in 1969) — are shown here with their 1970 cards.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Here’s one obvious reason the United States leads high-income countries in maternal mortality rates and why the rate for deaths among black mothers is significantly higher for the country over all: the lack of paid leave.

Yes, we should be concerned about what happens at the time of birth, but losing income or a job because you take time for prenatal visits or bed rest surely takes a toll. So does going back to work within two weeks of delivery, something nearly one in four employed mothers do in this co untry.

Congress can take a big step toward solving this problem by passing the Family Act, recently reintroduced by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Representative Rosa DeLauro. The bill would provide up to 12 weeks’ paid time for multiple forms of care, including for parents to bond with a new child.

      <TEXT>Linda Macklowe, an honorary trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and a vice president and trustee of the Guggenheim Museum, was not required to go through with the planned purchase of an apartment in the building that is now adorned by the images of Mr. Macklowe and his new wife.

The first Ms. Macklowe had had a contract to buy the apartment on the 78th floor of 432 Park Avenue, but another court had permitted her to exit the deal, according to the judge in the divorce settlement. The divorce court awarded Linda Macklowe the couple’s condominium in the Plaza Hotel — created by joining seven apartments they bought in 2007 and valued by the court at $72 million — but gave Mr. Macklowe a $36 million credit on it.

Mr. Macklowe said on Saturday that some of his male friends had told him their wives now wanted the big-picture treatment. He said some of his female friends had said the same thing. “I got an email from a neighbor across the street who said, ‘I want my husband to do this for me for Valentine’s Day,’” he said.

If the photographs are like an art installation, the reviews from passers-by on Park Avenue were mixed.

“If you have the money and you want to do it, go ahead,” said Halle Mae Nottage, a college student from Kailua-Kona, Hawaii. “But it’s devastating to see people spend such money on such shallow things when there are bigger and more pressing issues on which money can be spent.”

Teya Goakey, a graphic design student from Port Angeles, Wash., said she would not want her portrait on the side of a building. “It’s weird to see,” she said, “and I feel like if I had that kind of money, I wouldn’t need the whole of New York City see my and my other half’s face on the side of a building. That’s a private thing. I wouldn’t need the whole city to know of my wedding.”

Allen Gross of the Bronx was unimpressed. “He could have done something much better,” he said, “something that would attract people’s attention.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>For men’s wear designer, how do you compare Kerby Jean-Raymond of Pyer Moss who has 10 employees, and Thom Browne, whose company is now owned by the Italian group Ermenegildo Zegna, and for whom this is his 10th men’s wear nomination (he has won three times)?

I have long had an issue with these awards — it’s the same problem in Britain — and think perhaps it’s time we all reconsidered the situation. Why not choose designer of the year every five years? Or just have the special honors that recognize achievement over time? It could still be a glamorous, glitzy fund-raiser, and it wouldn’t feel so much like a high school popularity contest.

Anyway, we’ll find out the winners in a few months — followed by Tom’s plans. While we all bate our breath, take a moment to read about why your shopping on Instagram is about to get a lot easier, get the inside scoop on the Levi’s IPO, and delve into the world of watches as, over in Basel, Switzerland, timepieceapalooza gets underway.

Q: Stories of women and designers of color like Mary Quant and Stephen Burrows are often hidden from the public eye. Who is your favorite fashion designer whose story has been written out of history? Elizabeth, San Francisco

A: There are so many! First, though, let me say that while we complain a lot about the revival of old houses, one positive side effect of the trend has been to keep alive names that might otherwise fall into the shadows of history. See, for example, the soon-to-be-revived House of Patou, which LVMH is readying for a comeback.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>For President Trump, the era of congressional oversight is shaping up to be a family affair, with his three eldest children — Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric — at risk of getting swept up in multiple investigations. But none of the Trump clan may face a more thorough going-over than Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and top White House adviser.

Mr. Kushner this week was among a long list of Trumpworld intimates asked to provide documents to the House Judiciary Committee as it looks into possible presidential misdeeds.

This request landed just as the continuing tussle was heating up between Mr. Kushner and the House Oversight and Reform Committee , which is examining claims that Mr. Trump arranged to have his son-in-law granted top-secret security clearance over the objections of intelligence officials.

In both cases, the White House has signaled its intent to defy Congress, arguing executive privilege and legislative overreach. On Monday, the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, sent a letter to the oversight committee chairman, Elijah Cummings, rebuffing his request and effectively daring him to start issuing subpoenas. Mr. Cummings said he would confer with colleagues to determine what comes next.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“It’s refreshing to see someone stand before the people,” Mr. Lhota said, “and say, ‘Hold me responsible. Hold me accountable.’”

Mr. Johnson’s speech had the feel of a campaign rally as he sought to position himself as a leader capable of thinking big, in contrast to Mr. de Blasio, who has been criticized for a lack of bold new initiatives in his second term. Mr. Johnson also challenged the state Legislature, saying that the City Council would approve congestion pricing if Albany failed to do so, though it is not clear whether the Council has the authority.

The speech made clear that if Mr. Johnson runs for mayor, he would use the city takeover of the transit system as a signature issue, just as Mr. de Blasio focused on early childhood education when he first ran for mayor in 2013. Mr. Johnson was introduced by his mother, Ann Richardson, who is from Boston and has the accent to match, telling the audience about her son’s “kind loving haht.”

Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat in his third term, has received a wave of criticism over his handling of the transit system. Although he exerts great control over the agency, he has argued that he does not have enough power and that one person or entity should take charge and be accountable to the public.

A Cuomo spokeswoman, Dani Lever, responded to Mr. Johnson’s speech with a short retort: “The city already owns the New York City Transit system,” in reference to a long-running debate over whether the city technically owns the system — a contention that Mr. de Blasio’s office has disputed.

The authority is governed by a board that typically has 17 voting members, including six members chosen by the governor and four by New York’s mayor. Mr. Cuomo selects the board chairman and has a role in hiring the agency’s top leadership.

Mr. Johnson was careful not to mention Mr. Cuomo’s name or to attack him directly, though he criticized the unpopular decision by the Cuomo administration to divert transit funding to struggling ski resorts. Mr. Johnson joked that a mayor would never make that decision over fears that it would lead to tabloid headlines of “Mayor to City: Go Sled!”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Thanks to the internet, everything seems knowable. All of those little mysteries that used to fuel conversation — Who was that guy in that movie? How big is the Pacific Ocean? Do you think that TV dog is dead now? — are so easily solvable. Now everyone can just check their phone. But there is one part of the internet that is drawn to things that cannot be Googled. The mystical internet has arrived. New apps like Costar Astrology and the Daily Hunch are part of a suite of internet products rebranding the zodiac for the digital set. Astrological sign memes dominate Twitter. The Hoodwitch, an online retailer who sells everyday magic for the modern mystic, has amassed over 260,000 Instagram followers for her hashtag #witchtips and beautifully staged tarot readings. Even Spencer Pratt, the arch villain of “The Hills,” has reinvented himself as a crystal outfitter. “The tiger’s eye, I wear for protection, and it worked, because I wore this in the ‘Celebrity Big Brother’ all-star house, and I was super-protected.” But a lot of the appeal of this stuff isn’t really based in any strong held belief in the occult. You don’t have to actually believe in astrology to be into it. Putting aside whether planetary alignments actually influence the personal lives of human beings, astrology and other nonscientific practices are sometimes less about predicting the future than they are about helping to understand ourselves. Posting a hermit tarot card to Instagram is a way of signaling introversion. A piece of rose quartz stone is an expression of unconditional love. “Love is who I am.” And astrology, it’s basically the cosmic Buzzfeed quiz. In other words, this is a content business as much as it is a spiritual practice. There are for sure enterprising capitalists who are eager to profit off of all of this. [singing] “These eggs are on fire.” Goop has built a whole online retail empire serving what it calls, “the divine feminine.” “The egg is in, I think.” But online mysticism is also filling a legitimate need. This is a turn to emotion in the face of all of the data that dominates the internet. It’s a rejection of all the algorithmic, data-driven, hyper-logical, crypto-libertarian values that run so much of what we do online. In their place it carves out room for intuition and empathy. And yeah, it all feels pretty girly, but men have their online mysticism, too. It just looks a little more like this. “And this is some satanist imagery here that goes over the connections of this symbolism.” And if masculine mysticism is obsessed with conspiracies, drawing connections between historical events and random images, feminine mysticism, on the internet at least, seeks to draw spiritual connections between human beings. “I’m a Gemini, so there’s two sides of me.” I’m a Gemini, too, so I’m of two minds about this whole trend. My curmudgeonly twin points out that this is all a ploy to get women to spend more money on useless stuff, but my more compassionate twin appreciates a corner of the internet that values justice and empathy. “The horoscopes are meant to be healing.” After all, the woo-woo crazy of a vagina jade egg pales in comparison to this. “We believe the Earth was a flattish disk surrounded by a solid dome barrier called the firmament.” In this context, retreating into the mystical internet actually feels like a quite rational move. Hey, I’m Amanda. I’m Shane. She writes the videos. He edits the videos. And if you like the videos, just keep watching and another episode will play. [singing] “Internetting with Amanda Hess.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Paul Gilroy, a British scholar known for his studies of black cultural expression on both sides of the Atlantic, has won Norway’s Holberg Prize, awarded each year to a scholar who has made outstanding contributions to research in the arts, humanities, the social sciences, law or theology.

The prize committee, in a citation, called Mr. Gilroy, 63, “one of the most challenging and inventive figures in contemporary scholarship.” His landmark 1993 book “The Black Atlantic: Modernity and Double Consciousness,” which argued that slavery and the slave trade created a hybrid culture that transcended national boundaries, transformed the study of the African diaspora and “offered an alternative to essentialist conceptions of identity by showing how race, nation and ethnicity are culturally constituted,” the prize committee wrote.

The prize, first given in in 2004, comes with an award of 6 million Norwegian kroner, or about $700,000, making it one of the largest international awards in the humanities. Previous winners include the American legal scholar Cass Sunstein, the British philosopher Onora O’Neill, and the French sociologist Bruno Latour.

Mr. Gilroy, currently a professor of American and English literature at Kings College London, established his reputation in 1987 with “There Ain’t No Black in the Union Jack: The Cultural Politics of Race and Nation,” a study of racism in Britain and longstanding black contributions to a culture often imagined as resting on a purely white and Christian history.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Good Wednesday morning. Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today.
• Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has recommended designating Iran’s Revolutionary Guards as a foreign terrorist organization. It would be the first time the United States designated a unit of another government’s military as a terrorist group, and some American officials caution it could put troops and intelligence officers at risk.
• President Trump hosted Jair Bolsonaro, the Brazilian president, at the White House on Tuesday. Mr. Bolsonaro is a brash nationalist whose populist appeal comes from his use of Twitter and his history of making crude statements.
• The Trump administration’s $1.5 trillion tax cut in 2017 promised sustained economic growth. But while the cuts have activated some aspects of the economy in the short term, officials now concede they will not be enough to deliver the 3 percent annual growth the president promised over the long term.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Re “Medical Field Has a Long Way to Go in Treatment of Minorities” (The Upshot, Feb. 26):

Affordable medical education, board certification and long-term physician-patient relationships are ways to eliminate bias in medical care. Our profit-driven health system creates limitations in each: Medical school tuition tops $200,000, recertification board exams cost $1,000 each , and most physicians are now employees with limited time for contact with patients.

Studies show that some minority patients have better outcomes with minority providers, but the National Institutes of Health (among others) reports that African-American medical school enrollment by men is critically low, partly because of expensive tuition.

Physicians are leaving medicine in droves because of burnout from increasing regulation and reduced insurance reimbursement. Regulations like electronic medical records have devolved from improving physician communication to limiting payments.

Approaches like free medical school tuition no w offered by New York Universit y and restructuring health insurance are a start in changing our negative trajectory. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said, “Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health is the most sh ocking and inhuman.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Multiple news outlets identified the Jazz fan as Shane Keisel. Keisel told ESPN that he did not swear at Westbrook or otherwise say anything inappropriate, and that he believed they were having fun. In an interview with local television station KSL, Keisel said Westbrook had been using profanity and “acting a fool,” which fans responded to by heckling him.

Keisel said he saw Westbrook’s knees wrapped in towels, so he told him to “sit down and ice your knees, bro.” Westbrook responded that the wraps were for heat, Keisel said, adding that he then told Westbrook, “Well, you’re going to need it.” Keiser said the woman sitting next to him, who ESPN identified as his wife, Jennifer Huff, did not say anything to Westbrook and had her hands in her lap.

Attempts to reach Keisel on Tuesday were unsuccessful.

Keisel was sitting in the third row on the baseline, near the Thunder bench. Unlike in most other sports, in basketball fans can sit just a few feet away from players. This can lead to good-natured and spirited exchanges — like the back-and-forth heckling between Spike Lee and Reggie Miller in the 1990s — but also to large problems.

Most infamous is what is known as The Malice at the Palace in 2004. After a brawl between the Indiana Pacers and Detroit Pistons at The Palace of Auburn Hills in Detroit, a fan threw a drink at Ron Artest, a Pacers forward at the time who has since changed his name to Metta World Peace. Artest charged into the stands, followed closely by teammate Stephen Jackson, and threw a punch at a fan. Artest was suspended for 86 games, and five players eventually pleaded no contest to misdemeanor assault charges.

Since the incident, the N.B.A. has taken numerous steps to prevent violence, especially between players and fans. Players are now automatically suspended if they leave the bench during an on-court altercation, and fans whose unacceptable conduct is overheard by or reported to security are issued cards warning them that they can be ejected from the arena.

In a statement after the game, the Jazz said arena security issued several warning cards to fans during the game.

Westbrook has had a number of run-ins with fans in the past, including in Salt Lake City. During last year’s playoffs, Westbrook twice got into it with fans while leaving the court. The first time he stepped toward and yelled at a fan that was leaning over the railing talking to him; the second time Westbrook swiped at a phone that a fan had pushed toward his face.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The coaches led soccer teams and sailing teams, guided water polo champions and budding volleyball stars. At least two had won N.C.A.A. championships. A third gave Michelle Obama and her daughters tennis lessons from his post at Georgetown.

The coaches charged Tuesday in a massive federal college admissions fraud scandal were some of the most prominent in their fields. But it was their apparent willingness to exploit their access to the admissions process at several exclusive universities that has them facing federal charges.

Who are they? Several had deep associations with the University of Southern California, where Donna Heinel, a senior athletic department administrator, is accused of playing a central role in the scandal. For nearly a decade, Heinel had overseen the admissions of athletes into U.S.C., working closely with several of the current and former Trojans coaches who have been indicted. She was fired Tuesday.

Here is a brief look at the current and former coaches identified by a federal complaint.</TEXT>

“This is the Max?” Mr. Gonzales asked, his eyes widening. “I’m not getting on that plane if it’s the Max.”

The model, which on Sunday was involved in a fatal crash for the second time in five months, had by Tuesday been banned from the national airspace of China, Australia and countries in the European Union. At least 34 airlines around the world have grounded their planes since Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed on its way from Ethiopia to Kenya, killing all 157 people on board.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>When Facebook revealed last week that it had stored millions of people’s account passwords in an insecure format, it underlined the importance of a security setting that many of us neglect to use: two-factor authentication.

That might sound like a mouthful, but it has become essential for our digital protection. What it stands for is basically two steps to verify that you are who you say you are, so that even if a password falls into the hands of the wrong people, they cannot pretend to be you.

Here’s how two-factor authentication has generally worked: Say, for instance, you enter your user name and password to get into your online bank account. That’s step one. The bank then sends a text message to your phone with a temporary code that must be punched in before the site lets you log in. That’s step two. In this way, you prove your identity by having access to your phone and that code.

Sounds simple and safer, right? Yet barely anyone uses it. According to Google, fewer than 10 percent of its users have signed up for two-factor authentication to protect their Google accounts for services including email, photos and calendars.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The transportation secretary, Elaine L. Chao, called on Tuesday for her agency’s internal watchdog to investigate the process by which the Federal Aviation Administration in 2017 approved designs for the 737 Max. Lawmakers in Congress also are pushing for a review, while Canada is looking into its approval of the plane’s American certification.

The specific allegations that the Defense Department’s inspector general is examining revolve around complaints, first reported in Politico, that Mr. Shanahan disparaged competitors of Boeing during meetings at the Pentagon with senior national security officials and lawmakers, two United States officials said.

Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts and a member of the Armed Services Committee that would consider Mr. Shanahan’s confirmation if he is nominated, said she alerted the Pentagon’s internal watchdog after hearing that he “may have advocated on behalf of his former employer, Boeing, while serving as the acting defense secretary.”

“The American people should be able to trust that government officials are working for them — not for big defense contractors,” Ms. Warren, who is running for president, said in a statement.

While Mr. Mattis resigned in protest of Mr. Trump’s policies — including the surprise announcement that American troops would withdraw from Syria — Mr. Shanahan has held the line for the president.

As the deputy defense secretary, Mr. Shanahan made clear that “we are not the Department of No,” as he told officials after the administration announced plans to create a new stand-alone Space Force at the Pentagon. It has since been moved to the oversight of the Air Force.

Since becoming acting defense secretary, Mr. Shanahan has raised the ire of some lawmakers. Last month, Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said he did not believe Mr. Shanahan shared the “humility” of Mr. Mattis but did not elaborate. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, also clashed with Mr. Shanahan last month over the planned troop withdrawal from Syria.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The conclusion by the special counsel that President Trump did not conspire with Russia all but assures that Mr. Trump’s political fate will be determined at the ballot box next year — intensifying pressure on Democrats to settle on a candidate and a policy agenda that offers them the best chance to defeat the president.

With House Democrats now far less likely to impeach Mr. Trump, and Senate Republicans certain to resist removing him if they did, the 2020 race will revolve more around his performance in office than how he won in the first place.

That may disappoint some Democrats, who believe that the Russian interference on Mr. Trump’s behalf in the 2016 race makes his presidency illegitimate. But it offers the party a chance to oust him through democratic means that would be harder to dispute, rather than the divisive tactic of impeachment.

So far, the response of most of the candidates to the Mueller report has been to demand that Attorney General William P. Barr release the document in full. But some top Democrats are urging them to move past the report and instead focus on the promises they say he has failed to keep, and highlight their differences with the president on issues like immigration, tax policy and health care.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“Once we get caught on fire, we can run through whatever we need to run through,” Eatman told his players. “If we ever get caught on fire, we’re going to be just fine.”

That never happened against Buffalo. The Bulls trailed by 2 points after both the second and third quarters, but took control of the game midway through the fourth.

It was a disappointing end to a season that began with a celebration when Stringer became the fifth Division I women’s coach to win 1,000 game. More than 100 of her players, past and present, were there that night. Two of Stringer’s fellow basketball Hall of Famers, David Robinson and Charles Barkley, recorded tributes to her, the first African-American coach to reach the 1,000-win milestone. So did Billie Jean King, Whoopi Goldberg and Hillary Clinton.

It was an extraordinary moment, even for a coach who has reached the Final Four with three different programs, Rutgers, Iowa and Cheyney University of Pennsylvania. Her last trip to the Final Four, when Rutgers lost in the 2007 final, was marred by racist and sexist comments directed at her team by the radio host Don Imus. Stringer got more attention when she stood up for her players than the team had for its success.

Now her current team waits for her return.

“Even at the age she’s at now, it’s just crazy how much she outworks all the other coaches, and it just shows the love that she has for the game,” Guirantes said. “And as a player, you want your coach to have that love for the game just as much as you, and a person that just wants the best for you.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I recently read about an elementary school class that was studying the American Revolution. Each student chose a historical figure to write about. When the teacher asked if anyone had picked a woman, a little girl called out: “No! There were no women then!” Even in 2019 this is what many kids think, which is why we still need a month dedicated to the words and deeds of females. Knowing the challenges and achievements of all manner of women history makers, from the big names (I’m looking at you, Amelia Earhart) to the unsung heroes, destroys the false notion that females are mere observers to history. Their stories serve as both inspiration and empowerment: If she could, then I can.

PLANTING STORIES: The Life of Librarian and Storyteller Pura Belpré (HarperCollins, 40 pp., $17.99; ages 4 to 8) beautifully captures the life and essence of Pura Belpré, the first Puerto Rican librarian in New York City. Arriving in Manhattan with the “stories her abuela taught her,” Belpré eventually takes a job at the library as a bilingual assistant. “But where are her abuela’s stories? Not one folk tale from Puerto Rico is on the shelves. How lucky for the library that Pura has story seeds ready to plant and grow.” Belpré goes on to transform library programs through the telling (and eventual publishing) of several culturally diverse stories.

Anika Aldamuy Denise’s intimate telling captures the magical, folk-tale feeling of Belpré’s own stories. Her lyrical text, sprinkled like fairy dust with Spanish words, begs to be read aloud, while Paola Escobar’s stylishly detailed and warmly expressive illustrations capture the joy of sharing stories. But this biography, like all good biographies, does not simply chronicle a life. Beneath all the fun is a valuable message. As Denise writes in her author’s note, Belpré’s life is a “testament to the power of our own stories to build bridges — not just to literacy, but to social change.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Federal authorities investigating Russian interference in the presidential election obtained search warrants for emails of Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s former lawyer and fixer, beginning in July 2017, according to documents released Tuesday that provided a glimpse into the earliest stages of the inquiry into the president.

The documents show that by the time F.B.I. agents conducted a highly public raid on Mr. Cohen’s home and office in April of last year, his business dealings had already been the subject of an extensive investigation. 



The records, including search warrants and other materials related to the April raid, were among nearly 900 pages of documents that a federal judge unsealed in response to a request by The New York Times and other news organizations.

The records were heavily redacted. More than 150 pages were fully blacked out, and many had names or portions of the material obscured, mostly because they were related to the continuing investigation of the Trump Organization.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Many publications estimated that as many as 53 million songs from 14 million artists were affected by the data loss, but it wasn’t clear how much of that music was uploaded by users. (When Myspace rebooted in 2013, it boasted a library of 52 million songs thanks to deals with labels and uploads from users, according to reports at the time.)

The news was the latest chapter in the long decline of the once-mighty social media giant. Founded in 2003, a year before Facebook, MySpace boasted about 250 million users in the United States in its heyday. In 2005, Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation paid $580 million to buy the site’s parent company. Around that time, Myspace.com also became the most-visited website in the United States, briefly overtaking Google. But it changed hands two more times in the last decade for a fraction of that price, as Facebook, Reddit, Twitter and other platforms lured users away.

Myspace grew to be a formidable force in music hosting, at one point amassing the biggest library in digital music. But it struggled on that front, too, eventually losing ground to other services like Spotify.

For those who kept their accounts, the news of the data loss comes as little surprise. They have complained in Reddit discussions and elsewhere about receiving similar messages from the company for more than a year. Over the weekend, the frustration spilled into sight again after a much-cited tweet by Andy Baio, a former chief technology officer of Kickstarter.

Jordan Tallent is among the MySpace users who has been trying to recover his music. Last summer, Mr. Tallent, a 26-year-old audio-video professional in London, reached out to Myspace to ask for help recovering songs that his former post-hardcore/heavy metal band, Where Got Ghost, had uploaded to Myspace.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The king in a Super Bowl commercial for Bud Light may have “just wanted to return some corn syrup to its rightful owners” in the Coors Light and Miller Lite castles, but MillerCoors, which produces both beers, was not amused.

MillerCoors sued Anheuser-Busch on Thursday over the ad, claiming that it purposely misled consumers into believing there is corn syrup in Coors Light and Miller Lite, when there is not.

The lawsuit, filed in United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, comes nearly two months after the ad for Bud Light first aired, on Feb. 3, sparking a feud between the beer companies and anger from corn lobbyists. MillerCoors is asking for an injunction to stop Anheuser-Busch from continuing to air the ad, which it calls “false and misleading.”

In the ad, the king of the Bud Light Castle mistakenly receives a barrel of corn syrup and travels far across the land to deliver it to the correct address. When he and his companions arrive at the Coors Light castle, its king says, “Looks like the corn syrup has come home to be brewed.” The lawsuit claims that this statement, in particular, makes it seem as if corn syrup may be the only ingredient in Coors Light.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>A federal jury on Wednesday ordered Monsanto to pay more than $80 million in damages to a California man whose cancer it determined was partly caused by his use of the popular weedkiller Roundup.

The six-member jury found that Monsanto should be held liable for the man’s illness because it failed to include a label on its product warning of the weedkiller’s risk of causing cancer.

The verdict, delivered in United States District Court in San Francisco, is a milestone in the continuing public debate over the health effects of Roundup and its active ingredient, glyphosate, the world’s most widely used weedkiller. Monsanto is currently defending itself against thousands of similar claims.

The plaintiff, Edwin Hardeman, 70, used Roundup to control weeds and poison oak on his property for 26 years. In 2015, he learned that he had non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The next year, after the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer declared glyphosate a probable carcinogen, Mr. Hardeman sued Monsanto.</TEXT>

WASHINGTON — The Obama administration violated federal law by failing to adequately take into account the climate change impact of leasing public land for oil gas drilling in Wyoming, a federal judge ruled Tuesday.

But the decision by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia could also present a legal threat to President Trump’s agenda to quickly expand oil and gas drilling and coal mining across the nation’s public lands and waters. That’s because the decision amounts to a road map that could be used to challenge hundreds of Trump administration leases as well.

However, experts said that, while the decision could lead to legal delays for the drilling expansion envisioned by Mr. Trump by tangling them in litigation, it was unlikely to halt it entirely.

Tuesday’s decision by Judge Rudolph Contreras, which applied specifically to an Obama-era plan by the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management to lease several thousand acres of land for drilling in Wyoming, also concluded that the agency was legally required to consider the climate impact of all such lease sales for fossil fuel development.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Good Tuesday morning. Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today.
• President Trump and his Republican allies vowed to pursue and even punish those responsible for the Russia investigation now that the special counsel’s inquiry has concluded without implicating him. Mr. Trump said some of them had done “treasonous” things.
• The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, reached no conclusion about whether Mr. Trump had obstructed justice — it was Attorney General William P. Barr who cleared him of that offense. Democrats seized on that, portraying Mr. Barr’s decision as a hasty, dubious intervention on behalf of the president who installed him.
• The tight-lipped Mr. Mueller is poised to return to civilian life, still a figure of mystery and fascination.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“This young girl was forced to face not one abuser, but two, who were working together, for seven years,” Mr. Shapiro said in a recorded statement. “Thank you to this survivor in this case, who bravely shared her truth and will bring her abusers to justice.”

Weissport is a small borough in Carbon County on the eastern side of the state, nestled between the Lehigh Canal and the Lehigh River. It is home to about 400 people. Mr. Getz was hired as a part-time officer for Weissport in 2017 and promoted to the chief of police in February, according to local news reports. The department is tiny, consisting of just one officer as recently as 2016.

It is unclear how many are on the force now. Neither the mayor nor the police department immediately responded to requests for comment on Wednesday evening, and borough council members could not be reached.

When the girl first reported the abuse to her teacher in 2012, she said she had been abused by Mr. Wagner, who was then 22, multiple times, according to the attorney general’s statement. The teacher went to the Franklin Township Police Department, which opened an investigation.

But for reasons that remain unclear, no charges were filed at the time. The Franklin Township police did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday evening.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Saudi interrogators have reportedly tortured at least four of the women with electric shocks, and by whipping their thighs and sexually harassing and assaulting them, Human Rights Watch said in a statement on Thursday.

The nations’ statement said, “We call on Saudi Arabia to take meaningful steps to ensure that all members of the public, including human rights defenders and journalists, can freely and fully exercise their rights to freedoms of expression, opinion and association, including online, without fear of reprisals.”

The rebuke also signaled the enduring international outrage over the murder of Mr. Khashoggi six months after Saudi agents killed and dismembered him at the consulate. The Saudi authorities have charged 11 people in the case, but it has denied American intelligence reports that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing.

The 36 nations that backed the rebuke, among them Australia and Canada, urged Saudi Arabia to cooperate with an inquiry into the murder led by a United Nations expert, Agnès Callamard. She is to submit her findings to the Human Rights Council in June.

“The circumstances of Mr. Khashoggi’s death reaffirm the need to protect journalists and to uphold the right to freedom of expression around the world,” the statement said.

Though the 28 members of the European Union spoke with one voice Thursday in the council to condemn Saudi human rights abuses, the bloc’s leaders in Brussels backed away from a proposal to blacklist the kingdom over accusations that it helps fund terrorism and launders money.

European lawmakers said last month they planned to expand a list of states seen as weak when it comes to cracking down on tainted money, proposing to add Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Panama, among others, to a roster that already included countries such as North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Ethiopia and Afghanistan.</TEXT>

Chen, a freshman at Yale, opened with a quad Lutz and followed with a quad flip. The United States national champion, he then added two quad toe loops, one in combination, to solidify his lead.

“I’m proud of myself for being able to put out two good programs, the short and the long,” Chen said. “Ultimately, I’m just happy with how this event went, and I hope to have more experiences like this.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>If you want to see how an orchestra can give a fresh polish to dusty old Mozart, head to Lincoln Center.

There you’ll find a surprisingly novel Mozart program — played by the New York Philharmonic on Wednesday night under Manfred Honeck and continuing through Tuesday — that, like a fugue, tells a story of the composer’s final year while mapping a journey of death and transcendence.

Unlike Schubert, whose later works have an autumnal mood colored by sickness and melancholy, Mozart didn’t begin the year 1791 knowing that, months after his 35th birthday, he would fall ill and die soon after, on Dec. 5. So you would be hard-pressed to find a sense of farewell in his music from that time.

In fact, for most of the year Mozart was as stylistically nimble and prolific as ever. He presented the premieres of not one, but two operas, “La Clemenza di Tito” and “Die Zauberflöte.” And, in what would be his final public appearance as a pianist, he gave the first performance of his Piano Concerto No. 27 in B flat, which the Philharmonic opened its program with on Wednesday, featuring Richard Goode.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Contrary to his public statements, Trump pursued business in Russia deep into the presidential race.

Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to another charge: lying to Congress about how long Mr. Trump pursued a real estate project in Russia during 2016. His plea demonstrated that Mr. Trump had continued to negotiate over a proposed Trump Tower Moscow deep into the campaign — even as he publicly encouraged the Russians to hack Mrs. Clinton’s emails and the Kremlin kept up its effort to help his campaign.

As the investigations around Mr. Trump intensified at the end of the year, he tried a familiar tactic: He asked his acting attorney general to try to exert more control over the investigations related to Mr. Cohen.

In January, Mr. Mueller continued his pursuit of those around Mr. Trump, indicting the president’s longtime adviser, Roger Stone, on charges of lying to Congress about his contacts with WikiLeaks during the campaign. The indictment contained a curious detail. It said that a senior campaign official “was directed” by an unnamed person to have Mr. Stone inquire from WikiLeaks about the future release of material damaging to Mrs. Clinton.
• None Prosecutors Effectively Accuse Trump of Defrauding Voters. What Does It Mean?

Cohen raises the possibility of additional criminal liability for Trump.

In a daylong appearance before the House Oversight Committee, Mr. Cohen turned on the boss he had once said he would “take a bullet” to protect. He said he had only “suspicions” of a Trump-Russia connection but laid out evidence of a range of possible crimes with no Russian connection.

He displayed a check signed by the president, he said was to reimburse him for hush money payments, that could implicate Mr. Trump in a campaign finance violation. He described how Mr. Trump inflated and deflated the value of his assets to get loans or reduce taxes, actions that could amount to bank fraud, insurance fraud and tax evasion. He said Mr. Trump had indicated, without directly instructing him, that he should lie to Congress. He described how Mr. Trump had used his charity to purchase a portrait of himself, in evident violation of state laws governing charitable foundations.
• None Michael Cohen Accuses Trump of Expansive Pattern of Lies and Criminality
• None Testimony From Cohen Could Compound Legal Issues for Trump

Mr. Mueller delivered a lengthy report to Attorney General William P. Barr last month. Two days later, Mr. Barr announced that Mr. Mueller “did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with&quot; Russia.

A more clouded picture emerged on the question of whether Mr. Trump illegally obstructed justice. Mr. Barr said that Mr. Mueller declined to determine whether Mr. Trump broke the law but also pointedly did not exonerate him. Mr. Barr said that left it to him to make the judgment, and that he and Mr. Rosenstein concluded that Mr. Trump had not violated the law. But some of the special counsel’s investigators told associates that Mr. Barr failed to adequately portray their findings and that they were more troubling for Mr. Trump than his attorney general indicated.
• None Mueller Finds No Trump-Russia Conspiracy, but Stops Short of Exonerating President on Obstruction
• None Some on Mueller’s Team Say Report Was More Damaging Than Barr Revealed

If Mr. Mueller portrays Mr. Trump as intent on using his power to protect himself and his associates from an investigation, the revelations could prompt Democrats to expand their investigations into the president and even consider impeachment. But if the report simply summarizes what is already known, it could embolden Mr. Trump, who has already begun calling for scrutiny of the investigation’s origins.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Then there’s the issue of witness tampering. Podrick tells Tyrion he was offered a knighthood if he would testify that Tyrion bought poison. Someone else (Cersei? Tywin?) got to Shae. It’s a twisted trail that aligns with Olenna Tyrell’s and Littlefinger’s frame-job. Two weeks before the wedding, Olenna claims to be unhappy with the necklace presented for Margaery to wear, and tells a group of Tyrell women to go speak to the jewelers of King’s Landing and find her the best necklace in town. What she’s really looking for, of course, is the best poison container, since the Strangler comes in crystallized form. You may recognize it: It was the same stuff Maester Cressen popped in his wine to share with Melisandre in Season 2.

But Margaery can’t be seen wearing this necklace, so Olenna — with Littlefinger’s help — recruits someone else who will be in easy reach at the reception. Perhaps the murderers had hoped to make the murder look as if Joffrey had simply choked to death, but as a fallback, they also set up Sansa and Tyrion as the likely suspects. Why else have Dontos whisk Sansa away as soon as Joffrey starts choking? Why else throw the used necklace onto Dontos’ dead body, assuring it could be found later, instead of into the water? Though Olenna and Littlefinger made Sansa look very guilty, they also guarantee she would escape punishment. Tyrion, however, not so much. Even though he recognizes he’s been framed, Tyrion doesn’t connect this latest betrayal to the last time Littlefinger framed him. After all, Littlefinger has an alibi this time.

Littlefinger wants Sansa on multiple levels — she’s the key to the North, she reminds him of her mother and she’s the pupil he never had. Although he’s imparted a bit of information to her in past seasons, he really starts confiding in her during the escape boat trip (and by doing so, becomes vulnerable to her). While he doesn’t out his partners in Joffrey’s murder outright, he drops a strong enough hint (“grow strong,” referring to House Tyrell’s words “growing strong”). He admits to killing Joffrey, and he kills Lysa with Sansa as a witness. He teaches her not to trust anyone. He shows her how to be devious, which she does by incorporating the truth, twisting it ever so slightly, displaying real emotions to give the lie some force and proclaiming that she has to tell the truth and she’s no good at deception anyway. (As Sansa defends herself with Lysa, “he says I’m a stupid little girl, I’m a stupid little girl who never learns! And I’m a terrible liar!”)

Sansa gets a lot of mileage out of being a terrible liar (as Littlefinger recognizes at the end of Season 2). By lying to the lords and ladies of the Vale and using a little reverse psychology, Sansa lines up some protectors in her corner, especially Lord Royce, who was a friend to her father (and likely grew up with him when Ned Stark was fostered in the Eyrie). More important, Sansa now has leverage over Littlefinger and can always play the “you murdered Aunt Lysa” card later. When Sansa wore the necklace given to her by Dontos, she was still susceptible to romance and fairy tales. When she switches to a large black buckle on a chain necklace in Dark Sansa mode, she’s announcing that she’s outgrown such notions and is ready to be a game-player in her own right.

“Nothing like a thoughtful gift to make a new friendship grow strong,” Littlefinger says. Of course, he’s referring to the “gift” of murdering Joffrey, a rather pricey present. Gifts are rich in meaning, often signifying much about the giver and the recipient, which is why Lysa becomes so suspicious about the crates of lemons Littlefinger ships to the Eyrie, all so Sansa can snack on her beloved lemon cakes.

Daario offers Dany flowers — as a way of being romantic and schooling her about strategy. Dany gives the people of Meereen broken chains from the necks of former slaves to encourage them to revolt and, in turn, deliver the city to her. Tywin gives a freshly forged sword of Valyrian steel to Jaime to entice him to forsake his vow to the Kingsguard and to be the Lannister heir. Jaime then gives that to Brienne, along with armor and a squire, to enable her to fulfill a vow that he cannot. Her calling the sword “Oathkeeper” signifies that she understands this and more. (It is perhaps one of the truest, most selfless gifts, and is acknowledged as such.)</TEXT>

      <TEXT>DUBLIN — Officials in Northern Ireland said on Thursday that one former British soldier would be prosecuted on murder charges in connection with the massacre of unarmed civilians by British forces nearly 50 years ago in Londonderry, an event that came to be known as Bloody Sunday.

The former soldier, identified only as “Soldier F,” will be charged in the killings of James Wray and William McKinney, and with the attempted murder of four others. Eighteen others, including 16 former British soldiers and two nationalist gunmen said to have fired shots that day, will not be prosecuted, the officials said, on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence to provide a reasonable chance of conviction.

The massacre on Jan. 30, 1972, became one of the main flash points in the Troubles, the 30-year struggle over the status of Northern Ireland that claimed at least 3,500 lives.

[The Troubles still cast a shadow over Northern Ireland.]

The announcement in Londonderry on Thursday by the Public Prosecution Service of Northern Ireland was greeted with dismay by many of the victims’ families, some of whom said they would mount a legal challenge.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Trout does have a number of endorsement deals with companies including Rawlings and Nike, and in 2014 he became of the first baseball player since Ken Griffey Jr. to get a Nike signature cleat. But baseball players’ ability to move merchandise pales in comparison to that of a basketball player or a soccer player, and endorsement contracts reflect that.

Trout earns an estimated $2.5 million from endorsements annually, according to Forbes. Kevin Durant’s endorsement deal with Nike alone is worth up to $300 million over 10 years, while Harden will earn $200 million over 13 years from Adidas. LeBron James of the N.B.A. and Cristiano Ronaldo, the Portuguese soccer star for Juventus, have lifetime deals with Nike that are rumored to be worth $1 billion each.

While a handful of athletes earn more from their contracts annually than Trout, those individuals almost assuredly will not be doing so in 2030, the final year of Trout’s deal. N.B.A. contracts last a maximum of five years, and with a few exceptions, soccer contracts are rarely longer than that, either. Boxers typically earn their money fight to fight, while golf and tennis players simply claim a share of tournament prize money.

But in 2030, no matter how Trout’s baseball career progresses, he will earn at least $36 million — a priceless long-term assurance.

He has earned the payout by putting together seven astounding seasons to begin his career; the most similar players, production-wise, at his age, according to Baseball Reference, have been the Hall of Famers Frank Robinson, Ken Griffey Jr. and Mickey Mantle. Trout has won two American League Most Valuable Player Awards and been the runner-up four times. His career batting average is .307 and he is the majors’ active leader in on-base plus slugging percentage, at .990.

But, adding to Trout’s lack of recognition and earning power, postseason success has eluded him. He has reached the playoffs just once, in 2014, when the Angels were swept by the Kansas City Royals in a division series. The possibility of Trout departing for a new team loomed after the 2020 season, when his six-year, $144.5 million contract was set to expire; Harper, for one, had said he would love for Trout to join him in Philadelphia.

Trout still lives in his hometown, Millville, N.J., in the off-season, and is a die-hard Philadelphia Eagles fan. But the Angels had tried to impress upon Trout the benefits of keeping his work and home lives separate, and to sell him on the idea of being a one-team icon with a franchise with which he has thrived. And with a promise of an enormous paycheck — at least for on-field performance — the Angels put together a winning pitch.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>We know that the Russian government interfered repeatedly in the 2016 presidential election, by hacking into computer servers of the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign. We know that it did this with the goals of dividing Americans and helping Donald Trump win the presidency. We know that when top members of the Trump campaign learned about this interference, they didn’t just fail to report it to the F.B.I. They welcomed it. They encouraged it. They made jokes about it. On the same day that Mr. Trump publicly urged the Russians to hack into Hillary Clinton’s emails, they began to do just that. And we know that when questioned by federal authorities, many of Mr. Trump’s top associates lied, sometimes repeatedly, about their communications with Russians. None of this is in dispute.

That Mr. Mueller couldn’t find sufficient evidence that Mr. Trump or anyone involved in his campaign had coordinated directly with the Russians may be explained by the fact that they didn’t need to. They were already getting that help.

We also know that what began as a counterintelligence investigation quickly turned into a criminal investigation, in large part because Mr. Trump surrounded himself with criminals. To date, his campaign chairman, Paul Manafort; his deputy campaign chairman, Rick Gates; his national security adviser, Michael Flynn; his campaign foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos; and his personal lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, have all pleaded guilty or been convicted of federal crimes. In January, Mr. Mueller charged Roger Stone, Mr. Trump’s longtime aide, with multiple counts of witness tampering, obstructing justice, and making false statements.

Imagine if we’d learned all of this just Sunday, in one fell swoop, rather than in a trickle of indictments and prosecutions over the last 18 months.

Americans are, of course, continuing to learn more unsettling truths from the dozen or so other investigations that are continuing, such as the one in New York that has already landed Mr. Cohen a three-year prison sentence for campaign-finance violations that prosecutors said Mr. Trump was also involved in, from the White House.

One might expect Mr. Trump to feel happiness at Sunday’s news, but for him, that emotion seems to transform into a desire for vengeance. It’s no surprise that he and his allies are once again floating the idea of prosecuting Mrs. Clinton. Remember her? She was the candidate who, during a presidential debate all the way back in 2016, said: “It’s pretty clear you won’t admit that the Russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the United States of America, that you encouraged espionage against our people, that you are willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wish list, break up NATO, do whatever he wants to do and that you continue to get help from him because he has a very clear favorite in this race.”

Mr. Putin did have a clear favorite. He interfered on his behalf, and his favorite was elected president. Trump campaign officials knew about this and were more than happy for the help. Then they lied about receiving that help. This isn’t so complicated. And while Mr. Mueller may not be able to do anything about it, Congress, and the American people, certainly can.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The writers faced discrimination and harassment from their fellow staff members. They remained in the same lowly jobs as their counterparts were promoted. They watched their pitches get ignored or rejected, only to see the same ideas warmly embraced when another writer pitched them.

Such workplace woes have long been experienced by television writers who are women or people of color, and who remain minorities in an industry overwhelmingly dominated by white men. Now a new survey, “Behind the Scenes: The State of Inclusion and Equity in TV Writers Rooms,” of nearly 300 women, people of color, members of the L.G.B.T.Q. community, and people with disabilities writing for television has captured in numbers the bias they report.

— 64 percent of respondents said they had experienced discrimination or harassment by fellow writers, be it about their appearance or their inability to “take a joke.”

— 73 percent said they had remained in the same job for at least two seasons while white male staff members received two or even three promotions. For writers of color, the figure jumped to 82 percent.

— 78 percent of writers of color said they were the only person of color on their staffs.

— 53 percent said their pitches had been rejected, but when a white male writer made the same pitch, it was accepted.

— 58 percent said they had experienced microaggressions after pitching non-stereotypical content.

— 61 percent said they had worked with showrunners who were resistant to diversifying story lines.

The survey singled out shows that succeeded with diverse writing staffs, including “Queen Sugar,” “black-ish,” “Pose” and “One Day at a Time.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Scott Walker, who with his American pop group, the Walker Brothers, became a teenage idol in Britain in the 1960s, but who later immersed himself in experimental music that influenced artists like David Bowie and Radiohead, died on Friday in London. He was 76.

His record label, 4AD, said the cause was cancer. He had been living in England since the 1960s.

The Walker Brothers arrived in England in early 1965, reversing the earlier British invasion of America. There, the group — made up of Mr. Walker (his real name was Noel Scott Engel), a dramatic baritone who played bass; John Maus, a guitarist and vocalist; and Gary Leeds, the drummer, all of whom used the surname Walker — found the success that had eluded them in the United States.

Though their popularity never reached Beatlemania levels, their fans, like those of the Beatles, would scream during their performances — and, in one harrowing incident, turned over a van taking them from a concert in Dublin.

Evoking the blue-eyed soul of the Righteous Brothers, the Walker Brothers had several hits, two of which rose to No. 1 on the British charts: “Make It Easy on Yourself,” a ballad by Burt Bacharach and Hal David, and “The Sun Ain’t Gonna Shine Anymore,” which had first been recorded by Frankie Valli of the Four Seasons. Both songs also rose to the Top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Good Monday morning. Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today.
• The investigation led by Robert S. Mueller III found that neither President Trump nor any of his aides conspired or coordinated with the Russian government’s 2016 election interference, according to a summary of the findings by Attorney General William P. Barr. (Read the four-page summary here.)
• The special counsel reached no conclusion on the charge of obstruction of justice, writing that “while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.” So Mr. Barr, whom Mr. Trump installed less than a month ago, pronounced the president clear of committing any criminal offense.
• Mr. Trump, who has long felt victimized by the Russia investigation, presented Mr. Barr’s statements as an unalloyed victory. “It was a complete and total exoneration.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Lately, when it comes to Thai food in New York, the spotlight has been on the spice-fueled cuisine of the Isan region, in the northeast. But the restaurateur Kittigron Lertpanaruk, also known as Khun Oh, is from the south, where curries dominate, and he feels it’s time to give that part of Thailand its due. His new restaurant, decorated with red hanging lamps, gilded Buddhist statues, temple bells and carved wood panels, features a long list of curries. They include cua kreang, a dry curry; gaeng kua, a black pepper curry; and tiplah, a salted fish paste curry. But Mr. Lertpanaruk, who founded the chain of Asian restaurants called Spice and who recently became a partner in Arun’s , a highly regarded Thai restaurant in Chicago, also knows what’s popular, so the menu has dishes like crispy spring rolls, tom yum soup, pad Thai, green papaya salad, satays and mango salmon.

The rooftop restaurant at Eataly NYC Flatiron has undergone its seasonal makeover. This spring, and continuing until fall, it’s a fantasy of blossoms, bedecked in flowers real and fake. The menu now features an array of spritzes, along with porchetta-stuffed pig .

On Jan. 15, the Dumbo, Brooklyn, location of the famous coal-oven pizzeria closed for renovation and a change of ownership. It’s now about to reopen, with two floors of tables seating 100 in all, and an open kitchen, as part of the Grimaldi’s chain of 43 pizzerias, based in Scottsdale, Ariz. The Grimaldi’s name and ownership have been repackaged more than once, and despite the company’s attempt to drape it in history, the Dumbo location, in a 19th-century bank building, became a Grimaldi’s only in 2011 . The original Grimaldi’s, now Juliana’s, is next door, and is still owned by its founder, Patsy Grimaldi. He has nothing to do with the bank-building location, nor with the national chain, and has only a tenuous connection to another Grimaldi’s group in Hoboken, N.J. (Opens Friday)

This kosher steakhouse featuring grilled veal chops and rib-eye chops, among other cuts of steak, also showcases specialty items like beef Wellington, Delmonico steak and Châteaubriand on a rotating basis. Raw bar items like sake-cured king salmon and hamachi carpaccio, as well as a panoply of sushi rolls (finfish, no shellfish), are served as starters. Roasted bone marrow with oxtail confit and duck dumplings are also on the menu devised by the executive chef, Joseph Paulino. Currently, the restaurant serves only dinner Sundays through Thursdays, but will begin serving lunch late next month.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>No states have moved to do this on their own, for the same reason they drifted to winner-take-all in the first place: Anything else dilutes their power and takes votes away from their favored candidates.

The winner-take-all system has essentially nothing to do with the reasons the founders created the Electoral College, like their concern about investing the masses with the power to pick the president. All of the states now award their electoral votes based on the votes of citizens, rather than on the votes of the state legislatures, as many once did.

The real debate is about regionalism

Just because the winner-take-all system is unintended doesn’t mean there isn’t an argument for it. The main, principled argument for it is that it discourages regionalism and encourages a candidate to appeal broadly throughout the country, rather than to a single region.

Although this doesn’t always work, it sometimes does. The 1888 election again offers a useful example. That year, Democrats won the popular vote by disenfranchising Republican black voters and running up the score in the Deep South, where they won by 70 percent to 26 percent. Republicans overcame that with some narrow victories in big states and more victories over all.

Republicans make a similar claim today about the 2016 election: They argue that Democrats won the popular vote because of their big margin in California, and that the Electoral College properly protected the rest of the country against an imperial California or New York.

But that is not what happened. Mr. Trump’s victory in the Electoral College was mainly because of impressive strength in the traditional battlegrounds, not lopsided and inefficient Democratic strength in their regional bastions. Indeed, Mr. Trump did just as well in his base states — call them Appalachafornia — as Mrs. Clinton did in California.

Mr. Trump’s electoral victory was a product of two factors. One was essentially an accident of state lines. The 2016 results could be flipped just by giving the Florida Panhandle to Alabama and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to Wisconsin. It’s not clear that there was anything about the distribution of Mrs. Clinton’s support that inevitably put it at a disadvantage in a winner-take-all system.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>This truth plays out vividly in the college-bribery criminal complaint. In one passage, William Singer, the founder of a college-prep business who authorities say was the architect of the scheme, explains his plan to a prospective parent.

“Every year there is a group of families, especially where I am right now in the Bay Area, Palo Alto” who “want guarantees — they want this thing done.” He goes on to describe three different ways of getting into college, all the while playing on his mark’s class anxiety.

He explains that there is the “front door” for chumps dumb enough to try to “get in on your own.” Then there is the well-known “back door” to college, which is the corruption we’re all familiar with: giving tons of dough to a university in the hopes of getting your kid’s name to stand out in the admissions office. Sometimes this works. Twenty years ago, the New Jersey real estate mogul Charles Kushner gave $2.5 million to Harvard; a few months later, his son Jared got a place in the freshman class.

But Mr. Singer dismisses the back door. It costs “ten times as much money” — he’s right about that — and because it’s greased by connections and a certain kind of social class, “there’s no guarantees.” Instead, Mr. Singer explains that he has devised something cheaper and more certain. Something more like an app. By contracting the little people — not drivers looking to make a little extra scratch but college athletics coaches, test proctors and a university administrator — he had pried open a “side door” into college.

“My families want a guarantee,” he says. “So, if you said to me, ‘Here’s our grades, here’s our scores, here’s our ability, and we want to go to X school’ and you give me one or two schools, and then I’ll go after those schools and try to get a guarantee done.”

Is there any better metaphor for the injustice of the modern economy than Mr. Singer’s “side door”? One popular defense of rising inequality is that it hurts no one: Sure, rich people keep getting richer, but if everyone else is also getting richer, albeit more slowly, why should the masses care, other than jealousy?

Corruption, routine and pervasive, is why we should care.

As Bob Dylan put it: Money doesn’t talk, it swears. Excess wealth doesn’t just buy shiny things. It buys power and influence, it buys class and it buys permanence. It buys the corrupt certainty that every one of life’s problems might be evaded through some special side door, and it does so at the expense of not just the poor but all of us, shattering even the thin illusion of meritocracy that still somehow seduces American politics.

As Mr. Singer put it to his customers: “It’s the home run of home runs.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>39A: MONEY PIT is still a great entry, even though I’ve moved into a new-to-me house that requires extensive renovations and I sighed audibly when I solved it.

Hi, kids! Back in the day, there was a stand up comedian named George Carlin (1939-2008) who wrote a bit about oxymorons that I feel sums up this theme better than I could. I don’t know if he was the first comedian to do so, but he spent a lot of time looking at the English language, and he was the one I remember pointing out to me the ludicrous aspects of how we put words together (“Jumbo shrimp” comes to mind). Many of his recorded routines are not standards friendly so I can’t post them here, but I highly recommend taking a deep YouTube dive into his performances.

Anyway, Mr. Evans offers us a set of four oxymorons where the pairs of words might not appear to have anything to do with their partners until you are well through the solve. I solved the theme from the top to the bottom, and by the time I got to the third entry, I stopped to stare at the theme until I understood it. And then, as they say, it hit me: The first and second words in each theme phrase are opposites. It’s Opposite Day!

For example, at 17A, “Zombies” are commonly known as “the LIVING DEAD.” The theme entry at 46A, FOUND MISSING, might be a bit tough for a Monday — I believe that the phrase is mostly a Britishism — but I’m betting that at least some Times solvers will know it.

Perhaps some will say this theme is OLD NEWS. Others may say it is AWFUL GOOD. Either is a DEFINITE POSSIBILITY. When I sent in the FINAL DRAFT of this puzzle, I thought it had REAL POTENTIAL, but likely faced EVEN ODDS for acceptance. So I was TERRIBLY PLEASED when I got the good news it would be in The New York Times. NOTHING MUCH beats that feeling. I’m FAR CLOSER to where I’d like to be as a constructor thanks to the expert guidance of Will and his team. This is BITTERSWEET for me since my father, Ron, passed late last year before he was able to see my puzzles published in the Times. GOOD GRIEF, was he a SERIOUSLY FUNNY guy. I like the challenge of constructing Monday puzzles because it’s HARDLY EASY to make them clean, interesting and accessible to new solvers. ONCE AGAIN, it’s a privilege to have the chance to give you a moment or two of entertainment as you start your week. I hope you enjoy the puzzle. I have a FEW MORE on the way. Also, I got a puppy since last you heard from me. His name is Donut. He is far more entertaining than any crossword puzzle could hope to be. My kids are trying to make him Instagram famous. Follow him at @mydonutlife if you like.

Almost finished solving but need a bit more help? We’ve got you covered.

Warning: There be spoilers ahead, but subscribers can take a peek at the answer key.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>A core project of today’s Supreme Court under the leadership of Chief Justice John Roberts is to reorient the First Amendment’s two religion clauses, the one that prohibits religious “establishment” and the other that protects “free exercise.” Accomplishing this requires defining narrowly what counts as an establishment, as a 5-to-4 majority did five years ago in the Town of Greece case, upholding the practice of Christian prayers delivered at town government meetings on the ground that the prayers were simply speech that no one had to listen to.

And in the name of free exercise, the project requires broad carve-outs for religious believers from government regulation in the name of free exercise. This is a complex area where statutory and constitutional law intersect. In the 2014 Hobby Lobby case, the court allowed a business owner to refuse on religious grounds to cover birth control in his employee health plan in defiance of the Affordable Care Act.

That 5-to-4 decision was based on an interpretation of a federal statute, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The court’s most conservative justices — Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh — are currently trolling for a case that would provide a vehicle for reinterpreting the Free Exercise Clause to give the same robust protection for believers as the statute, in the court’s view, currently does. Achieving that goal means overturning a 1990 precedent, Employment Division v. Smith, which offered a parsimonious interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause and prompted Congress to pass the Religious Freedom Restoration Act in an attempt at a legislative workaround.

An opinion all four justices signed in January demonstrated their hunger for a case that could lead to that decision’s overturning. They explained why the court was not hearing an appeal brought by a public high school football coach who was fired for insisting on kneeling and praying on the football field after the superintendent told him to stop. The four justices noted, with evident regret, that the court had not been asked in that case to revisit either the 1990 decision or a 1977 statutory ruling that interpreted the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to place only a minimal burden on employers when confronted with a religiously observant employee seeking some sort of accommodation.

In fact, on the court’s current docket, there happens to be a new appeal that asks the justices directly to overturn the 1977 decision, Trans World Airlines v. Hardison. The new case, Patterson v. Walgreen Co., is awaiting the court’s action on whether to accept it for argument and decision.

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act requires employers to “reasonably accommodate” an employee’s religious practice as long as the employer can do so “without undue hardship” on the conduct of the company’s business. The court’s 1977 decision defined “undue hardship” as any accommodation that imposed more than a “de minimis cost” on the employer, an easy test for employers to meet and a very difficult one for religious employees. The only two dissenters then were the court’s most liberal members, Justices Thurgood Marshall and William Brennan, who argued for a more generous view of the required accommodation. That all the conservative justices were in the majority demonstrates how the polarity on church-state issues has shifted in the intervening decades.

The new case was filed by a Seventh-day Adventist whose need not to work on Saturdays was usually accommodated by the pharmacy company.

      <TEXT>“They were susceptible,” Dr. Munzer said, “but the basic electronic book without the enhancements was also distracting to toddlers, and they had less engagement with their parents than with print books.”

So while earlier research had suggested that the enhancements were problematic for young children, the results of this study suggested that even a nonenhanced story on the tablet screen seemed less likely to generate that parent-child dialogue. “The tablet itself made it harder for parents and children to engage in the rich back-and-forth turn-taking that was happening in print books,” Dr. Munzer said.

The researchers can only speculate about why; it may be because of the patterns we are all accustomed to in using our devices. Perhaps “the tablet is designed to be more of a personal device, perhaps parents and children use it independently at home,” Dr. Munzer said. There were also some struggles over who got to control the tablet, and more “negative format-related comments,” like “Don’t touch that button.”

And a print book, with a young child, may be a better piece of technology, if the goal is dialogue and conversational turn-taking. “A print book is just so good at eliciting these interactions,” Dr. Munzer said. “You’re comparing a tablet with the gold standard.”

I was one of the co-authors of a commentary accompanying the study, which acknowledged the many potential benefits of electronic books for children, but argued for continuing to rely on print books for the very young, including in programs that encourage parent-child reading.

My colleague, Dr. Suzy Tomopoulos, assistant professor in the department of pediatrics at N.Y.U. School of Medicine, who was the lead author on the commentary, said that whatever the medium, “parents need to read together with their child, use what they’re reading, and expand on the text.” With younger children, she said, there’s evidence that they get distracted with e-books, and there’s a lot of technology being actively marketed to parents nowadays. “You don’t need a lot of bells and whistles to support your child’s development,” she said. “Engaging the child and talking to the child does a wonderful job of supporting early child development.”

Reach Out and Read has a partnership with Scholastic, which this week released the seventh edition of its Kids &amp; Family Reading Report, a national survey of school-age children and parents. It found that though 58 percent of the kids surveyed said they love or like reading books for fun, there has been an incremental decrease in reading frequency among the children surveyed since 2010.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Like many other relics of the ’80s and ’90s, the scrunchie has returned to relevance in recent years at the hands of fashion designers. Chanel, Balenciaga and Mansur Gavriel have incorporated them into collections. A Danish company called Comfort Objects repurposes vintage Hermès scarves as $190 “hair clouds.” Maison Cléo, a French online retailer, sends its customers a free scrunchie with every order. Model-influencers like Bella Hadid and Hailey Bieber have been known to sport the occasional scrunch.

The accessory has also retained its mass-market appeal, and can be found larding the checkout line of many fast-fashion stores, in a wide variety of prints, fabrics and volumes.

Scrunchies have a largely feminine history. Britney Spears’s fuzzy pigtails in the “Baby One More Time” music video and the “Full House”-era Olsen twins’ ponytails come easily to mind. Decades of women and girls crowned by these soft, colorful accessories are cataloged on the account @scrunchiesofinstagram. Tougher to conjure are images of longhaired men whose tresses are loosely bound by a loop of fabric.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Ogden R. Reid, the former editor of The Herald Tribune who represented congressional districts in Westchester County, N.Y., for 12 years, first as a Republican and then as Democrat, died on Saturday at his home in Waccabuc, N.Y. He was 93.

His death was confirmed by his son David.

Mr. Reid was the scion of a newspaper publishing family whose grandfather was the editor and principal owner of the renowned New York Tribune and whose father merged it in the 1920s with the equally storied New York Herald to form The Herald Tribune. Mr. Reid was The Herald Tribune’s president and editor in the 1950s.

The newspaper was respected for its high-quality journalism but dogged by financial troubles that would help bring its demise in the 1960s; the family sold its controlling interest in 1958. Mr. Reid entered government service the next year when President Dwight D. Eisenhower named him ambassador to Israel.

In 1961, another Republican, Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, appointed Mr. Reid chairman of New York’s State Commission Against Discrimination. Some politicians saw the move as intending to help make Mr. Reid better known in the state should he seek elective office. His family’s ties to the Republican Party went back to the 19th century.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>When Rod Serling opened “The Twilight Zone” for business in 1959, it was a single, specific location. He defined it, in his signature Professor Spooky voice-over, as a place between light and shadow, science and superstition — you know the drill.

But the twilight zone was also a safe space, an underground meeting place to talk about things you couldn’t talk about on TV. Serling, a playwright harried by network censors in the 1950s, saw that he could tell unsettling stories — about prejudice, conformity, human frailty — if he dressed them in monster masks and alien goo. The show’s title came to define anything uncanny, any situation in which our sublimated nightmares became manifest.

So anyone remaking the series in 2019 has to answer, not just what is “The Twilight Zone” 60 years later, but where is it? In an age when there’s little you can’t show on TV, where are the forbidden zones? What is it people can’t say — or, at least, won’t say?

The new “Twilight Zone,” which arrives Monday on CBS All Access, does not lack for talent, big names or production resources. But as for finding its own distinctive place, it’s still looking.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Since then, Saudi security forces have detained dozens of clerics, intellectuals and activists who were perceived to pose a threat, as well as people who had posted critical or sarcastic comments about the government on Twitter.

Details: At least a dozen missions were carried out by the same team that killed Jamal Khashoggi in October, suggesting that the gruesome murder was part of a broader push, according to officials and associates of some of the Saudi victims.

The group behind Mr. Khashoggi’s killing, which American officials called the Saudi Rapid Intervention Group, also forcibly repatriated Saudis from other Arab countries and detained and abused prisoners in palaces belonging to the crown prince and his father, King Salman.

Here’s what else is happening

Afghanistan: Three months after the country’s soccer chief, Keramuddin Keram, was accused of sexually abusing members of the women’s national team, an investigation has stalled, amid fears it will never proceed.

Britain: The speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, warned Prime Minister Theresa May that she could not hold a third vote in Parliament on her beleaguered Brexit plan unless it was substantially different from the proposal already been rejected twice.

India: Gauri Lankesh, a journalist who railed against the right-wing Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., was shot dead in September. We take a deep look at her story and what it reveals about the country’s increasingly intolerant politics.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“There probably will be some uncomfortable findings,” she said. “But, that’s kind of the point. We’re doing something wrong. We have to correct it.”

All the experts agree that pregnant and postpartum women need to trust their instincts. If something feels off, trust yourself and get help.

“It is so important for families to realize, if they’re not getting an answer that reassures them 100 percent and they’re still concerned, they need to go find another person. Or go to the emergency department,” said Ginger Breedlove, a nurse and midwife from Kansas City, former president of the American College of Nurse Midwives. Dr. Breedlove was the editor of the book “Nobody Told Me About That, The First Six Weeks,” to help women better prepare for postpartum life.

Thinking of pregnancy as a marathon, rather than a sprint, is a common analogy used by birthing experts who point out that just as you’d never expect to run a marathon without researching, training and planning for the big day, the same should be done for birthing.

Given the huge variation in C-section rates per hospital, Dr. Shah suggests checking on your hospital’s rates, which are available by calling the facility or on sites like Leapfrog and rankings in Consumer Reports.

“You’d do the same thing if you were buying a car or a house, or something else really important,” Dr. Shah said. “The overwhelming majority of healthy women should be able to have normal, spontaneous, vaginal deliveries when giving birth — we have done a poor job communicating this and, in a world where the C-section always looks like the right answer, we have done a poor job enabling this.”

He added, “A world with more vaginal deliveries than we have now would ultimately improve the long-term health of both mothers and babies. That is the goal.”</TEXT>

      <TITLE>Review: In ‘Shadows,’ on FX, Laid-Back Vampires Return for Another Bite - The New York Times</TITLE>

      <TEXT>A key difference between movies and TV series is their relation to mortality. When a movie becomes a TV series, the creators must adapt a finite story into one that can unfold indefinitely. A movie, as a rule, must complete a world; a series must keep building one. A movie must end (at least until the sequel); a TV series must proceed as if it might never die.

“What We Do in the Shadows,” beginning Wednesday on FX, has an advantage on that last front, and not just because its characters, a gang of eccentric vampire housemates, are already dead. The 2015 movie, from Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi, already played like a tight, brief season of TV, in the most pleasurable way.

The mockumentary, about a group of bloodsucking ancients navigating modern life in Wellington, New Zealand, was driven more by character than plot, much like a hangout sitcom. Like Clement’s “Flight of the Conchords,” it had a deadpan — rather, undeadpan — sensibility and a penchant for characters who were less cool than they imagined themselves.

The FX version recasts and relocates to America while retaining the core premise. Staten Island, apparently the New Zealand of the tristate area, is now home base for Nandor the Relentless (Kayvan Novak), a medieval Ottoman warrior; Laszlo (Matt Berry), a Romantic-era English dandy; and Nadja (Natasia Demetriou), Laszlo’s rapacious old flame and now hunting partner with benefits. (Clement and Waititi, who co-starred in the film, each write and direct several episodes.)</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Consider Quentin Tarantino, who learned movie history as a video store clerk himself in the 1980s. Once video stores were the only place cinephiles could find favorite films after they left theaters. Then came the internet. The rise of online streaming services was a convenience for movie lovers, but it spelled, too, the end of an era. Last month, Blockbuster, which used to operate 9,000 stores, announced that only one remained, in Bend, Ore.

As for Scarecrow, it survived bankruptcy, the threat of closing and the death of its charismatic founder. In 2014, it became a nonprofit. And now, after 30 years, with more than 132,000 titles — many on VHS, laser disc and DVD — it is as much a cultural warehouse as anything else.

And that gives Kate Barr, Scarecrow’s president, pause. Film lovers today have access to a prescribed number of movies on streaming services like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu, and other niche channels. Old treasures — many of which are unavailable online because of rights issues or technological hurdles — are being locked away, forgotten or even destroyed .

Of Scarecrow, Ms. Barr said, “We will fight to the death to keep this open.”

Sure, most people no longer want to trudge to the video store on a Friday night, as they once did in droves. Streaming movies are available through on-demand cable, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and many other sources. But the emphasis tends to be on current titles, or TV series. Netflix, which pioneered renting DVDs by mail and streaming, has been moving steadily into original programming, for example.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Two weeks before the opening of the Shed, the ambitious $475 million arts center opening where the High Line meets the luxe Hudson Yards development, workers in hard hats were busily turning its biggest theater into a standing-room-only dance floor for the celebration of African-American music that will inaugurate it April 5.

When that ends, they will install 1,200 seats for a run of staged Bjork concerts. Then the seating will be reconfigured for its next show, a kung fu musical featuring aerialists and Sia songs. And, by the middle of the summer, the theater’s walls and ceilings will disappear, as its airy, silvery puffer jacket of a shell rolls back on rails to expose an outdoor plaza for free open-air performances.

New York has never seen a new cultural entity quite like the Shed — and not just because of its unusual building.

[See how the Shed’s nesting shell moves on rails to create indoor or outdoor space.]

It was born, improbably enough, of the failed attempt to bring the Olympics — and a football stadium — to Manhattan. It began with an idea for a new kind of arts building, before it was entirely clear what would go inside. It was nurtured by the administration of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a billionaire who gambled an eye-popping $75 million in public money on it before it was fully defined — and later matched the amount with a $75 million gift of his own money. And, in an astonishing feat, it raised nearly half a billion dollars before opening.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The opinion, from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, extends constitutional habeas corpus guarantees to those applying for asylum at the border and provides that they can seek a hearing in the federal courts before being summarily deported — though the court did not specify what standards the courts must use to evaluate such petitions.

The ruling applies to asylum seekers in the nine western states included in the court’s jurisdiction and, because it conflicts with an earlier ruling rejecting such legal protections in the Third Circuit, the issue is likely to be resolved ultimately by the Supreme Court. In the meantime, legal analysts said, the court’s decision is likely to have sweeping implications for immigration deterrence efforts by enabling thousands to remain in the country while they seek the court review.

Under current procedure, every migrant who arrives at the border and expresses a fear of persecution in his or her homeland is referred for an interview with an asylum officer. Those who succeed in convincing the officer that they have a credible fear are allowed to enter the country and proceed with their asylum cases in the immigration courts. Those who don’t can request a review by an immigration judge, but it is usually cursory and favorable decisions are rare. There is usually no access to a lawyer, and no opportunity to challenge the decision; deportation quickly ensues.

In the case before the appeals court, Vijayakumar Thuraissigiam, a member of Sri Lanka’s Tamil ethnic minority, was arrested about 25 yards north of the border near San Ysidro, Calif., and told an asylum officer that he was fearful of returning to his homeland. The officer found no credible fear, and that finding was upheld by a supervisor and an immigration judge.

Mr. Thuraissigiam was in deportation proceedings when he filed a habeas corpus petition in the federal court. He argued that the asylum officer had failed to elicit important background about his case, including that he had been detained and beaten by Sri Lankan army officers on two occasions, and at one point had been lowered into a well and nearly drowned. He also said there were communication problems between the translator and both the asylum officer and the immigration judge.

As a result, his lawyers argued, he was deprived of “a meaningful right to apply for asylum.”

A district court judge in Los Angeles rejected that argument, but the three-judge appeals court panel, sitting in San Francisco, held that even though an asylum seeker may lack the right to a full trial in immigration court, the Constitution requires a more complete review than what immigration law currently provides.

At its “historical core,” said the 48-page opinion written by Judge A. Wallace Tashima, “the writ of habeas corpus has served as a means of reviewing the legality of executive detention, and it is in that context that its protections have been strongest.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Justin Trudeau came to office in 2015 by the high road, exuding charm, confidence, integrity and an openness to change. He filled his cabinet with women and minorities, opened Canada’s doors to immigrants and posed for endless selfies with adoring crowds. But in politics the fresher the face, the more obvious the blemishes.

With seven months to go before Canada’s next national election, the prime minister is embroiled in a political scandal that his charm cannot wipe away. Two members of his cabinet, both prominent women, have resigned, as has his closest adviser, and unless he can convince the public — and do so soon — that he really did nothing wrong in trying to head off the criminal prosecution of a big Montreal-based company, the damage will only get more serious.

The crisis unfolded after The Globe and Mail newspaper reported on Feb. 7 that Jody Wilson-Raybould, Mr. Trudeau’s former justice minister and attorney general, had come under improper pressure from the prime minister’s office to reach a negotiated settlement with a multinational engineering firm, SNC-Lavalin, instead of prosecuting it on criminal charges it faces over its business dealings in Libya. Conviction would bar it from government contracts for a decade.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Organizers of a high-profile summer tournament for world soccer’s biggest club teams have decided to keep Juventus and its star Cristiano Ronaldo away from the United States this year, eliminating the risk of the Portuguese star’s being detained by the authorities as part of a rape investigation in Las Vegas.

While the bulk of the games in the tournament, the International Champions Cup, will take place in the United States as usual, Juventus’s games will be a part of the Asian version of the annual event. Juventus will be joined there — most likely in China and Singapore — by the Premier League teams Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United.

Ronaldo, a five-time world player of the year, is in his first season in Italy’s top league after Juventus paid more than $114 million to acquire him from Real Madrid last July. Only months after his transfer, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said it had reopened an investigation into accusations by an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, who said Ronaldo raped her in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009 and later paid her $375,000 for her silence.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Gunmen killed at least 110 Fulani herders in central Mali on Saturday, a local mayor said, in one of the deadliest such attacks in a region reeling from worsening ethnic and jihadist violence.

The assaults on the villages of Ogossagou and Welingara took place as a United Nations Security Council mission visited Mali to try to find solutions to violence that killed hundreds of civilians last year and is spreading across West Africa’s Sahel region.

Moulaye Guindo, mayor of the nearby town of Bankass, said armed men dressed as traditional Donzo hunters, encircled and attacked Ogossagou, killing about 60 people.

He said another nearby Fulani village, Welingara, had also been attacked, causing “a number” of deaths but that he did not yet know how many.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>This article has been updated to reflect news developments.

We now have so many potential candidates for president it’s very difficult to talk about them without whipping out a chart.

But come on, I know you can do it. This week Michael Bloomberg took his name off the list, so we’ve hardly got two dozen.

Very sorry to see Bloomberg go. His departure came just after Fortune announced he was ranked the ninth-richest billionaire on the planet, which is 706 places higher than Donald Trump. It would have been fun pointing that out several times a day for the entire campaign.

But if you’ve got over $55 billion there are probably more fun things to do over the next year than introducing yourself to every person in Iowa. So let’s see if we can master what’s left of the list.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>First, here’s the good news on Brexit. The Malthouse Compromise is dead. Britain has signed a post-Brexit free trade agreement with Fiji and Papua New Guinea. The irritating phrase “meaningful vote” has lost all meaning. Prime Minister Theresa May, who increasingly resembles one of those characters that just won’t die in a TV series, is running out of time to pop up again with her so-called “deal.”

The bad news is we’re only in Act IV, if that. This British disaster has legs.

It’s chaos out there with two weeks to go until the March 29 deadline for Britain to leave the European Union. This is what happens when English public school boys, nostalgic for Empire, dream up a scheme for the resurrection of British glory based on foisting every little-England frustration on their neighbors across the Channel who started or lost the war.

Delusion is the mother of debacle. Jon Snow, the Channel 4 presenter, lost it with the health secretary Matt Hancock as he tried to express some pious hope. Snow pronounced Britain “completely asunder.” He said that “nobody in the country knows what’s going on,” and that Hancock knew “nothing.”

His verdict on Britain after a week of parliamentary debate that went some way toward indicating what Britain doesn’t want but offered no clue as to what Britain does want: “We are a laughingstock.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WASHINGTON — On a three-state tour this week to promote her child-focused initiative, “Be Best,” Melania Trump showed that her time as first lady has sharpened an already sophisticated understanding of how to enhance her public image.

[Read More: Melania Trump booed while addressing students in Baltimore.]

In a glossy and tightly controlled environment, Mrs. Trump restricted the majority of her interactions to emphasize motherhood — perhaps the only part of her private life that she has publicly embraced. In Tulsa, Okla., she had a heartwarming exchange with a child who dislikes homework. In Seattle, she spoke to assembled Microsoft executives about the challenges children face online. And onstage at a theater in Las Vegas, she shared a rare personal story about warning her 12-year-old son, Barron, about the dangers of drug abuse.

“I try to explain how drugs are dangerous,” Mrs. Trump said, “and how they will mess up your head, mess up your body, and nothing positive comes of it.”

Mrs. Trump’s tour firmed up her commitment to “Be Best,” which addresses social media, well being and the opioid crisis, and which has faced setbacks from the start: The momentum of a Rose Garden debut in May was slowed when Mrs. Trump fell ill from a kidney condition soon afterward. And since then, she and her 12-person East Wing staff have had to deal with a departing policy director, a lengthy government shutdown, and countless chaotic news cycles engulfing President Trump’s White House.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — Roger Federer will face a hectic few days if he is going to win another Miami Open.

He is off to a good start.

Federer is through to the quarterfinals, having little trouble on the way to a 6-4, 6-2 victory over 13th-seeded Daniil Medvedev on Wednesday — needing only 61 minutes to prevail while committing a mere eight unforced errors. The match had been pushed back a day because of rain.

So now, to win what would be his fourth Miami title, Federer will have to prevail four times in a five-day span. Next up for the No. 4 seed is a quarterfinal Thursday against No. 6 seed Kevin Anderson — a match between the two highest seeds left on the men’s side, and the biggest test yet for Anderson since his return from an elbow issue.

“I’m feeling really good,” Federer said. “Today’s match, I can be really happy with so I hope it’s going to give me some confidence for tomorrow.”</TEXT>

      <TITLE>Part 3: What to Expect When You’re Expecting (the Mueller Report) - The New York Times</TITLE>

      <TEXT>We investigate further. The fact that he committed a crime is of great interest. It’s not necessarily a guarantee of impeachment. Those are two different tests, as you know. We have a responsibility well beyond the Mueller report. We have an obligation to do our own work. The Mueller report is only for what happened with respect to Russian interference in the election and with complicity by Americans in that interference and what crimes were committed and by whom. We have to be considerably broader. I mean, that’s part of our work, but our basic work is to provide for the rule of law, make sure that the rule of law is protected. That means that we have to look into obstruction of justice, into corruption, into abuses of power. And certainly what Mueller is looking into is part of that, but we have to be much broader.

Well, you have to understand that not every crime is an impeachable offense, and an impeachable offense needn’t be a crime. There are two different tests. So for example, if the Mueller report were to show that the president committed perjury with respect to money laundering five years ago in some scheme in New York to cheat — I don’t know. That would not be impeachable, because impeachment is an abuse of presidential power for the purpose or with the effect of aggrandizing power to the executive, of damaging liberty or the structure and functioning of government, the separation of powers. That’s what’s impeachable. Also, corruptly obtaining an election would be impeachable. But crimes that don’t bear on that would not be impeachable. So I said 20 years ago that the president’s perjury about a private sexual affair was not impeachable. And if President Trump were to be shown to have perjured himself about some business deal, that would not be impeachable. But if he were shown to commit perjury or to do something else that affected the structure and functioning of government or democratic rights or the integrity of elections, that would be impeachable.

Yeah, in New York, by the federal Southern District of New York or by the New York authorities or both, period. That’s the criminal justice system. Now the Justice Department maintains, wrongly in my opinion, that a sitting president cannot be indicted while in office, so they will not indict a president for committing some crime. I think it’s the wrong policy. I think they should be able to indict a president while he’s in office, but that’s not the real function of what we’re doing in our committee. Our committee’s job is not a criminal justice job. That’s up to the Department of Justice. That’s up to the New York state authorities. Our job is to protect the structure of democratic government and the liberties of the people. If the president committed a crime that has nothing to do with this, well, he ought to be prosecuted, but that’s not our business. We’re not a law enforcement agency.

Yes, and I’ve said it many times. I think there’s a threefold test for impeachment, really. Number one, has the president committed impeachable offenses? Number two, are those serious? And if the answer to the first two is yes, I think there’s one further test, and that is impeachment cannot be partisan. What you don’t want to do is divide the country so that half the country thinks for the next 30 years, we won the election. You stole it from us. You don’t want to embitter the country. The situation has to be such that you believe when you start the impeachment proceeding that the evidence you have is so persuasive of such terrible deeds that once the evidence is laid out, an appreciable fraction of the voters who voted for Trump will reluctantly say you had to do it. You’re not just trying to steal the election.

— to impeach is going to be political. Impeachment is a political task, and it’s intended to be by the Constitution. Yes, it’s going to be subjective. All political decisions are subjective. I shouldn’t say that. Almost all political decisions are subjective. But if this occurs, people are going to be on both sides, and some people will think you’re fair, and some won’t. But you have to really depend on the facts that you have at that point. You have to have very strong proof of very dire facts. And by the way, let me just step back. I’m a little concerned that we’re talking too much about impeachment. Our goal is not impeachment. Our goal is what I said a few minutes ago, to protect the rule of law, to protect the structure and functioning of government, to protect our liberties. That’s the basic goal. And if we can do that without impeachment, fine. If we have to do impeachment and if we meet the requirements so that we think we can do it, also fine.

No matter what I say or do, they’re going to say that. It’s the Republican strategy to say I decided to impeach the president the day after the election. It’s just an intent to distract. We haven’t decided. I haven’t decided to impeach. Some people have said that when I say, especially that third requirement, that’s a very high bar — and some people have said it may be an impossible bar. It may be. The three tests that I have said I didn’t invent. When we had the Clinton impeachment and I was a junior member of the committee, the first thing I did was to try to get my hands on everything that’s been written from Blackstone onward as to what’s an impeachable offense. But the second thing I did 20 years ago was I demanded that before we held hearings of the committee on fact, that we first hold a hearing on what’s an impeachable offense. And even though I was a minority member of the committee, I persuaded people, and we did that. And so what I’ve been talking about is basically what I got from that. I didn’t make up this test.

So in November of 2016, right after President Trump was elected, you called for then-F.B.I. director James Comey to be forced out of his job because of how he handled the investigation of Hillary Clinton and his decision not to charge her with a crime yet still detail her wrongdoing for the public. We all remember that news conference and how that worked, and you called that unforgivable. If Robert Mueller says no crime has been committed when it comes to the president, would you, as head of the Judiciary Committee, still try to bring forward to the public the information behind the Mueller investigation? And if you were did you that, I wonder what’s different in your mind between what Comey did and what you would be doing?

Yes. There’s a fundamental difference. The Justice Department has a very salutary general policy, and that is if you don’t indict somebody — why don’t you indict somebody? You didn’t have the evidence, obviously. You’ve investigated so and so. You’re not indicting her or him. You don’t comment negatively. You should, in a case of public notoriety, you should announce we’ve investigated. We’re not indicting him. That’s fine. But you have a policy, which the Justice Department does, that the president cannot be indicted no matter how much evidence just because he’s the president. Therefore we can’t comment on evidence against him or anything else. Then you’re converting a normally good policy into a cover-up, and you’re depriving Congress of its ability to hold the president accountable. You, the Justice Department, won’t hold him accountable because you’ve said you have no right to. You can’t indict him. That leaves only Congress, and now you’re going to deny Congress the right to the information. That makes the president unaccountable and above the law, and that cannot be.

No, the public needs to see the evidence, number one, so it can be confident that it’s true. We’ve tried to protect Mueller because by all accounts he’s an honest guy, et cetera, et cetera, and the investigation has to proceed. But whatever he says, we can’t take it on faith. We don’t operate that way. We shouldn’t take things on faith. And if he says the president has committed crimes, we should know what the evidence is. If he says the president hasn’t committed crimes, we should know what the evidence is. And if the president hasn’t committed crimes but has done terrible things that he knows about, we should know that too. Or if the president has done nothing wrong, we should know that. The public has a great interest in the president, obviously.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The Philharmonia Orchestra of London paid a visit to New York on Sunday and Monday with the conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen, and all I want to talk about is its sound.

But if I had to name the standout moment that’s stayed with me from their two concerts at David Geffen Hall, it would be a brief pause that was filled to bursting with tension.

It happened twice, actually, in the finale of a glittering performance on Sunday afternoon of Bruckner’s Symphony No. 7, where the composer writes in a short silence before a fortissimo onslaught. Both times, the hall filled with a mighty unison inhalation, a collective gulp of oxygen and nerve as powerful as that of an Olympic swimmer coming up for air in the butterfly.

[See Mr. Salonen’s thoughts on the modern orchestra.]

With good orchestras, you can sense the mental energy of 90-odd players bundled into one force. What I actually heard in those brief rests in the Bruckner were probably only the brass players reloading for the next big blow — but that breath was so dramatic as to seem to truly unify this massive ensemble.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Few would say that the Social Security disability program was free of fraud. The government has secured guilty pleas from a number of people who concealed the fact that they were working in various industries while drawing Social Security disability benefits.

In one case, a 57-year-old Louisiana man pleaded guilty last month to theft of government funds. He had received $2,177 a month in benefits — a total of $242,000 — while employed by companies that did demolition work and job site cleaning. He also operated heavy construction equipment. He told federal investigators that the companies had been registered in the names of family members, rather than his own name, “so y’all wouldn’t find out about it,” according to court records.

In its latest financial report, Social Security estimated that it made $3.4 billion in overpayments to disability insurance beneficiaries in 2017, in part because of their failure to report work activities.

The program has been “riddled with problems, including fraud and abuse,” said Rachel Greszler, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation. When people who can work collect benefits, she said, “it drains the system for those who truly cannot work and support themselves.”

The administration’s focus on fraud comes as the number of Americans seeking Social Security disability benefits is plunging. The number of applications was down 29 percent last year from a peak of 2.9 million in 2010.

A growing economy with strong demand for workers is one reason for the decline, officials say. In addition, they speculate that with new technology and the potential for teleworking, it is possible for some people to take jobs even though they have medical conditions that would have precluded work in the past.

Social Security officials are considering other changes that could make it more difficult for people to qualify for benefits.</TEXT>

Seth Meyers is tired of waiting for Joe Biden to announce whether he’s running for president. Biden has been dropping hints, and members of his inner circle have leaked tidbits about his decision-making process. But no date has been set for an official announcement.

Meyers said that there was hardly any ambiguity left — but that it’s still painful to have to wait.

“According to The Wall Street Journal, former Vice President Joe Biden has told several supporters that he intends to run for president in 2020. Oh my God, just announce already. It’s like going to a Lou Bega concert and wondering if he’s going to play ‘Mambo No. 5.’ He’s going to.” — SETH MEYERS “Joe Biden is the kid you played hide and seek with who would hide behind a sheer curtain.

      <TEXT>Ryan Adams’s planned tour of Britain and Ireland, due to start March 30 in Dublin, has been canceled, two weeks after allegations of sexual misconduct against the singer-songwriter emerged.

On Friday, SJM Concerts, the tour’s promoter, issued a statement saying the tour had been canceled and that full refunds would be issued to ticket holders by Monday.

On Feb. 13, The New York Times reported allegations that Mr. Adams had repeatedly manipulated and harassed women in the music industry, offering to jump-start their careers only to pursue them sexually and in some cases retaliate if they spurned him.

[Read The New York Times report here.]

The F.B.I. began an investigation into one of the allegations: that Mr. Adams exchanged sexually explicit images with an underage teenager.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>We call them upsets. But unless you root for the team on the wrong end of one, they are the happiest things on Earth. They should be called overjoyeds.

There are two kinds of tournament underdogs. There is the team that makes an unlikely deep run — to the second weekend, the regional final, the Final Four — by artfully dodging the biggest threats, by emerging as a great squad in its own right. Then there is the team that knocks off a contender before normalcy reasserts itself. The first kind is a new planet, or an aged single-malt scotch; the second kind is a comet, or a tequila shot.

[Follow our live coverage of Day 1 of the N.C.A.A. tournament here.]

Here are some tequila shots. No predictions are made for this year’s Loyola-Chicago, the No. 11 seed that made last year’s Final Four through the blessings of Sister Jean, good shooting and the luck of facing a No. 9 seed in the regional final.

Rather, these six teams stand a better chance of winning their first games than you — and, more important-, the other people in your pool — might think. Don’t sleep on the unlikeliest likeliest of all, at the bottom.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>For all of its details of Russia’s hacking, the report is unlikely to settle the questions that linger around the dossier more than two years after it became public. But for those who believe the president’s loyalties are with Moscow, the report’s suggestions of a link between Mr. Gubarev and Russian hacking is likely to spur new demands for renewed investigations, even as Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, appears to be wrapping up his investigation.

The dossier is made up of a series of reports compiled in the summer and fall of 2016 by Christopher Steele, a former British spy who runs a firm that conducts investigations for businesses and other clients. The work was done at the behest of President Trump’s political rivals, a fact that Mr. Trump and his allies have seized on in an effort to undermine the Russia inquiry by falsely claiming that it began because of the dossier.

Parts of the dossier have proved prescient. Its main assertion — that the Russian government was working to get Mr. Trump elected — was hardly an established fact when it was first laid out by Mr. Steele in June 2016. But it has since been backed up by the United States’ own intelligence agencies — and Mr. Mueller’s investigation. The dossier’s talk of Russian efforts to cultivate some people in Mr. Trump’s orbit was similarly unknown when first detailed in one of Mr. Steele’s reports, but it has proved broadly accurate as well.

Other parts of the dossier remain unsubstantiated, or nearly impossible to verify, such as its most salacious charge: that the Russians have a video of Mr. Trump cavorting with prostitutes in a Moscow hotel in 2013. At least one accusation — that Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer and fixer, met in 2016 with Russian officials in Prague — now looks false after Mr. Cohen, who has turned sharply against Mr. Trump, denied last month during congressional testimony ever visiting Prague.

The report commissioned by BuzzFeed to investigate the dossier did not set out to prove any of those accusations. It was done by FTI Consulting, a Washington-based firm, and focused solely on the accusations against Mr. Gubarev. It relied largely on analyzing internet traffic and other clues, and on digging through public records to glean insight into Mr. Gubarev’s holding company, XBT, and its many affiliates, including Webzilla. Both XBT and Webzilla were named in the dossier as being used for the hacking.

While the report found no direct evidence of a direct link to the Russian hackers, it did conclude that Mr. Gubarev’s web-hosting services are rife with lawlessness. His clients routinely pirate copyrighted material and spread malware, the report found, and his executives appear unconcerned with stopping them or helping authorities track them down.</TEXT>

By February 2017, Maisha Sudbeck had made peace with the idea she would never get justice. It had been five years since she was raped in Tucson by a man she had met online. The police had brushed the case off as a he-said-she-said standoff. For years, her rape evidence kit had sat untested. With two children and a new marriage, she had moved on with her life.

Then a detective knocked on her door.

The detective said a grant from the Manhattan district attorney’s office had helped the Tucson authorities clear a backlog of untested rape kits, which preserve the DNA evidence left by an attacker. After five years, Ms. Sudbeck’s kit had finally been tested, the detective said. And the police had found a match in a database of people with criminal records: a man named Nathan Loebe.

“My chapter was reopened,” Ms. Sudbeck said. “Having my kit finally tested was a catalyst for hope.”

In February, Mr. Loebe was convicted of sexually assaulting Ms. Sudbeck and six other women. Ms. Sudbeck testified against him at trial.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>When David Rock needs to immerse himself in his work, he goes offline. Being reachable, he knows, will tank his productivity.

In fact, Dr. Rock, the C.E.O. of The Neuroleadership Institute and author of “Your Brain at Work,” was able to write four books during several flights to and from Australia. He credits the long stretches of uninterrupted time with granting him the ability to fully concentrate on assembling those book drafts.

Sure, not everyone can hop a 13-hour flight to Australia when they need to finish a project. But the lesson Dr. Rock learned is applicable regardless: Making ourselves inaccessible from time to time is essential to boosting our focus. A 2017 survey from the American Psychological Association found that being constantly and permanently reachable on an electronic device — checking work emails on your day off; continuously cycling through social media feeds; responding to text messages at all hours — is associated with higher stress levels.

This phenomenon of always being reachable is what Linda Stone, a former Apple and Microsoft executive, calls continuous partial attention. Unlike multitasking — juggling activities of similar importance that don’t require too much cognitive processing — C.P.A. is a state of alertness during which you’re motivated by the desire not to miss out on anything.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“I don’t think they’re talking about impeachment,” he said on Tuesday as he walked into a Senate Republican luncheon on the other side of the Capitol. “We have the greatest economy we’ve ever had. Our country is in incredible shape. They and others created a fraud on our country with this ridiculous witch hunt, where it was proven very strongly, no collusion, no obstruction, no nothing.”

In fact, the special counsel pointedly said he did not exonerate Mr. Trump on the issue of obstruction of justice. It was Attorney General William P. Barr who stepped in to reject that charge.

Nonetheless, Democratic leaders were eager not to make too much of the opening. They have tried for months to play down the possibility of impeachment. Too divisive, they said. Too dangerous. “Not worth it,” said Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, who has urged her colleagues to beat Mr. Trump at the ballot box instead.

Mr. Mueller’s report to Mr. Barr, summarized in a letter to Congress on Sunday, seems to have finally proved the point. Mr. Barr wrote that Mr. Mueller had not found evidence to prove that the Trump campaign had conspired with Russia to subvert the 2016 presidential election or to bring a case that the president obstructed justice.

Ms. Pelosi met privately with members of her leadership team Monday night to discuss the path forward after the conclusion of Mr. Mueller’s investigation. On Tuesday, they emerged abuzz about a Trump administration’s legal motion to have the Affordable Care Act invalidated by the federal courts and intent on wrestling the narrative back to the party’s policy agenda.

Democrats have not given up on the Mueller report entirely, with six committee leaders leading the fight for access to the full report. And they say they will push ahead energetically with their own investigations into other aspects of the Trump presidency.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WASHINGTON — In announcing the United States’ annual list of the world’s worst human rights violations, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo this past week singled out South Sudan and Nicaragua for government-sanctioned atrocities against their own people.

Over the past year in South Sudan, Mr. Pompeo said, “military forces waged sexual violence against civilians based on their political allegiances and their ethnicity.” In Nicaragua, he said “when citizens peacefully protested Social Security benefits, they were met with sniper fire.”

But the Department of Homeland Security has sought to limit the number of immigrants who left South Sudan or Nicaragua for safety, seeking to temporarily live and work legally in the United States.

The apparent contradiction shows the Trump administration’s competing priorities and how they affect foreigners facing government corruption and violence.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>It comes as little surprise, sadly, that the Saudi thugs who slaughtered Jamal Khashoggi were a secret crew of enforcers for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. They had been watching, kidnapping, detaining and torturing Saudi dissidents for more than a year before they traveled to Istanbul to kill and dismember the Washington Post journalist.

According to a report in The Times by Mark Mazzetti and Ben Hubbard, citing officials who have read classified intelligence, the team is known to American officials as the “Saudi Rapid Intervention Group” and it carried out at least a dozen operations before the Khashoggi murder.

This comes as little surprise because of all the sordid information that has come out about the Saudi hit men and the crown prince since the brazen assassination of Mr. Khashoggi inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul shocked the world in October, and because of the clumsy initial attempts by Prince Mohammed to deny the killing and then to pin it on underlings who purportedly exceeded their orders and are now said to be standing trial in a courtroom no independent witnesses have been to.

In the five months since the killing, most of the world has learned that Prince Mohammed is not the modernizing liberal of the image he cultivated among Western leaders and visitors but rather a despot who suppressed those who challenged his image and his power.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Measles is transmitted by droplets from an infected person’s nose or mouth. The virus can live in the airspace where the person has breathed, coughed or sneezed.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, someone who is not vaccinated “can catch measles just by being in a room where a person with measles has been, up to two hours after that person is gone.”

How safe and effective is the measles vaccine?

The measles-mumps-rubella vaccine is extremely safe and effective. The vast majority of people who contract measles have not been vaccinated.

It does not cause autism.

If I choose not to vaccinate my child, why should anyone else care?

An unvaccinated child can get the virus and spread it to those who can’t protect themselves. Infants and people with compromised immune systems cannot get vaccines.

Why is this a problem now?

Vaccination rates are down worldwide. Public health officials are fighting back, repeatedly pointing out that medical and scientific evidence confirms that vaccines are safe. Still, dangerous misinformation is proliferating.

“This feels like a very real-world manifestation of what can happen when you’re in an echo chamber,” said The Times’s Michael Gold, who has reported on the recent outbreak.

      <TEXT>The sun bears were making faces at each other. And that was a bit of a surprise.

Comparative psychologists have been studying the facial expressions of primates like orangutans and gorillas for years. They have evolved in complex societies and thus need to be able to convey their joy, anger, and other emotions to their companions. But nobody had thought to look at creatures like sun bears, who live mostly solitary lives.

Marina Davila-Ross, a primatologist at the University of Portsmouth in England, and her colleagues learned that a handful of the Southeast Asian bears, which primarily live alone in the wild, were in a rehabilitation center near the orangutan center in Malaysia where Dr. Davila-Ross was doing research.

Curious about whether facial communication was more common in the animal kingdom that people thought, they deployed cameras to capture hours of footage of the bears interacting with each other. In a study published Thursday in Scientific Reports, they say that sun bears do use facial expressions to communicate, suggesting that the capacity to do so may be widespread, and that social creatures do not have a monopoly on expressing themselves this way.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Jackson was an unlikely candidate for his melancholy achievement: He had hit only one other home run that season, and he played in just 48 games while hobbled by a leg injury. And that home run seemed nothing special to him when the third-place Dodgers closed out their history the next day with a 2-1 loss to the Phillies, the last Brooklyn pitch delivered by an unproven left-hander named Sandy Koufax.

Earlier in that summer of ’57, when the Dodgers were on the brink of moving to Los Angeles and the New York Giants seemed headed to San Francisco, the Brooklyn-born comedian Phil Foster took up a lost cause with his rendition of “Let’s Keep the Dodgers in Brooklyn” on Coral Records.

The song, foreshadowing the borough of Brooklyn’s fate if its heroes fled to the West Coast, included a brief tribute to Jackson and the outfielder Gino Cimoli, though their Dodger careers were modest:

“Brooklyn would be like a pair of socks that’s holey/ Without Jackson and Cimoli.”

Jackson, in fact, had his best major league seasons playing for the Cubs from 1950 to 1955. He was a two-time All-Star with Chicago, hit 59 home runs over his final three seasons there and played alongside the future Hall of Fame shortstop Ernie Banks.

The Dodgers obtained Jackson in a multiplayer deal, expecting him to take over at third base from an aging Jackie Robinson. He arrived with a reputation for lacking fire, but as he told The Miami News at his first Dodger spring training camp, “My voice doesn’t carry more than six feet before it drops off, so what’s the use?”</TEXT>

Mr. Manafort, above in 2017, had perpetrated a decade-long, multimillion-dollar fraud scheme, but Judge T.S. Ellis said he lived “an otherwise blameless life.”

This week, a judge in federal court in Washington will sentence Mr. Manafort on two conspiracy charges, which carry a maximum penalty of five years each. Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, will also be sentenced this week.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Yes. If Mueller says the president didn’t break the law, then Barr has to figure out how much information to give to Congress so that Congress takes those findings seriously. The problem is Barr is in a very difficult spot politically, because the Democrats have already concluded the president did something wrong. So if Barr learns from Mueller that there’s no criminality on the president, how does Barr then win over those Democrats and show them that Mueller truly made a decision based on the facts? How much of what the investigation found does he have to give to the Hill? In a normal criminal investigation, all of that information would not become public because the Justice Department would want to protect the individual who they have found did not commit a crime. But this situation is different, because a lot of people do think the president committed a crime. So how do you show the Democrats and the rest of the country that hey, look, this is what Mueller found. He only found X, Y, and Z. And if we wanted to make a case, he would have needed to have uncovered these other things, which he did not. And that’s why we’re confident with his findings.

Well, how much of the evidence that Mueller uncovered should go to Congress? What should be told to Congress? Should Congress be told explicitly, look, Mueller believes the president violated these laws, and here’s the evidence to back it up? But what if some of that evidence has been obtained from a grand jury? The Justice Department can’t just hand over grand jury information to Congress. What if the information is classified? They’re not going to want to hand over classified information to Congress. They think Congress leaks like a sieve.

When will we know more? Barr and his deputies will go through this, and I don’t know — sometime in the next few days, sometime in the next few weeks. It may be a difficult process to unbraid. Mueller has been rummaging around the president’s life for 22 months. We don’t have clarity into everything Mueller’s found. What if Barr looks at it and says, eh, Mueller thinks he violated this law and that law. But actually, I don’t think he has it. Maybe there’s not enough there. Maybe Barr disagrees with what Mueller has found, simply on a legal basis. The other thing is that Barr only really gets one shot to get it right. Whatever he goes out the door with in terms of handing over information to Congress, he’s got to have it right. He’s not going to have a second chance to say, well, you know, I gave you that stuff. But like, meh, maybe it’s not what I thought it was. Or, oh, let’s give you more. He has to get it right the first time. Otherwise, he’ll look like he’s waffling.

Barr clearly knows Congress is going to jump up and down until it is satisfied with the information that it wants about this investigation. He can drag that out and probably lose it one way or another, either in the court of public opinion or in the actual courts. So he probably just wants to get it over with as soon as possible. He knows this has been an enormous weight on the country, and that the sooner it is resolved, the sooner the country can move on.

I don’t know. I mean, the number of people who will have access to this document will be very small. And they will know that if there are a lot of leaks about this, then the president can start to raise questions about what’s really going on. It will look nefarious. The Democrats will get their backs up and say, well, if this stuff is leaking out, why can’t we have access to it? They will know that their lives will be much more difficult if there are leaks here. Obviously, you could come up with a scenario where someone working on the investigation is frustrated that the Justice Department has decided to go one way or the other on the report, and they think, ah, screw it, I’m going to make this public. But my guess is they have gone to great lengths to ensure that this is heavily protected.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Joanna Hardy, independent jewelry specialist, London: “Visiting downtown Bogotá is an assault on the senses: You are exposed to all its wonderful, eclectic mix of urban life where live music is being played with backdrops of graffiti art, and it is here that you will find a hidden treasure: the Gold Museum. In its inner sanctum, you will find the world’s most important collection of pre-Hispanic gold artifacts that miraculously survived the looting from the Spanish conquistadors in the 1500s. The museum has over 34,000 gold items, and to see how gold was crafted by the indigenous people of South America who lived over 500 years ago is quite incredible.”

Christian Hemmerle, jeweler, Hemmerle, Munich: “The Schatzkammer (Treasury) at the Munich Residenz (former royal palace of the Wittelsbach monarchs of Bavaria) is to me an incredible, inspiring collection, with treasures collected by the rulers of Bavaria over the centuries. It was established in 1565 by Duke Albrecht V, the Wittelsbach family’s first great patron of art. Ranging from medieval art works, religious artifacts, royal regalia, swords, crowns and medals of honor among many other exhibits, the collection contains pieces of exquisite craftsmanship and cultural importance that may be impossible to recreate at this day and age.”

Vincent Meylan, chief editor for jewelry, Point de Vue magazine, Paris: “My favorite jewelry museum is the Galerie d’Apollon, in the Louvre, in Paris. Strangely, it is a place which is not very famous. Tourists usually pass in front of the massive double doors; they take a brief look inside the gallery and they run to join the queue for Mona Lisa. The jewels which are exhibited there are mostly French crown jewels or jewels coming from the collection of our queens. One of the oldest pieces is a spinel cut as a dragon, which belonged to François I (1494-1547) and my favorite pieces are the sapphire parure of Queen Marie-Amélie and the diamond bow of Empress Eugénie.”</TEXT>

• The Senate voted to overturn President Trump’s national emergency declaration at the southwest border, delivering a bipartisan rebuke for what lawmakers in both parties deemed executive overreach. The 59-41 vote on the House-passed measure sets up the first veto of Mr. Trump’s presidency.
• House Republicans joined Democrats to demand that the Justice Department publicly release the full findings of Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and the possible involvement of Mr. Trump’s campaign.
• Three votes in Congress this week — rebuking Mr. Trump over Saudi Arabia, blocking his national emergency declaration and demanding a public release of the Mueller report — demonstrated a newfound willingness among some of Mr. Trump’s Republican allies to stand up to him.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Roman emperors can be so troublesome to the modern reader. Less because their crimes were, by modern standards, breathtaking — although as Barry Strauss shows in his engaging new book, “Ten Caesars,” they were. Nero, it is claimed, committed incest with his mother, then executed her. The emperor Galerius, meanwhile, was said to enliven mealtimes by feeding criminals to his pet bears as he ate. Yet terrible though these acts may be, one must admit that they make for entertaining if unsavory reading.

The real reason emperors cause modern hearts to sink is not so much the matricide, fratricide, pederasty or (in one instance) insistence on entirely blue meals. What is truly troubling about the emperors is that there were just so many of them. Between the start of the first and the fourth centuries there were (depending on how you count them) around 70 or so — five in A.D. 193 alone. And they were hardly kind with their names. It takes a reader of stern historical fiber not to be a little put off by the concatenation of Constans, Constantius and Constantine.

So even before opening the first page of “Ten Caesars,” the reader feels a debt of gratitude to Strauss for scything off a superfluous 60-plus rulers and concentrating on a manageable number. The table of contents shows that he has further simplified things by giving each emperor an epithet. So you find “Tiberius, the Tyrant,” “Nero, the Entertainer” and so on — a trick familiar from the names of medieval kings. Or possibly “Game of Thrones.”

Strauss, a professor at Cornell, has the intellectual credentials to brave such simplification. Moreover, the task he has set himself requires it. To cover 360-odd years in a similar number of pages means going at quite a lick. The four-decade reign of Augustus (“the Founder”) is covered in 40 pages.

      <TEXT>If dance is a kind of knowledge, what kind is it? Who has the right to dance what? Is a legacy public, and what can legitimately be done to it? What do staged bodies signify, other than mere form?

These are some of the questions projected before the start of Netta Yerushalmy’s “Paramodernities,” a six-part work, nearly four hours long (including two intermissions), that had its New York debut at New York Live Arts on Thursday.

Those are really big questions, and this is an excitingly ambitious work. Each segment takes on a canonical choreographer: Vaslav Nijinsky, Martha Graham, Bob Fosse, Merce Cunningham, George Balanchine, Alvin Ailey. But even to list all those names is only to hint at the enormous chunk of ideas that the production bites off and tries to chew.

It’s not easy to say what “Paramodernities” is. It’s the kind of work that keeps asking the question of itself — not implicitly but verbally, because each section is centered on one or two scholars who deliver something like a lecture. At the same time, there are dancers onstage, and what they are doing is not exactly a demonstration.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>SEOUL, South Korea — President Moon Jae-in of South Korea will meet with President Trump in Washington on April 11, his office announced on Friday, as Mr. Moon struggles to salvage his role as a mediator between Mr. Trump and North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un.

Mr. Moon has devoted his government’s diplomatic efforts to facilitating a deal between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim on dismantling North Korea’s nuclear arms program and building lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula. But those efforts hit a wall when Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump ended their summit meeting in Vietnam last month without a deal, confirming how far apart they were on the terms of denuclearization.

Mr. Moon has since vowed to continue to work as a mediator, with his office saying that Mr. Trump had asked for that. But Washington wants Mr. Moon to focus on persuading Mr. Kim to denuclearize before expecting the United States to lift sanctions. The North, conversely, wants Mr. Moon to help ease sanctions first.

“The two heads of state will hold deep consultations with the aim of further strengthening the South Korea-United States alliance and building a peace regime on the Korean Peninsula through complete denuclearization,” Mr. Moon’s office said in a statement announcing the April meeting.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The museum actually has two T. rex skeletons, the second and more complete of which now lords over the Hall of Saurischian Dinosaurs upstairs. Initially it was assembled to stand upright, tail dragging on the floor. It now appears in a more accurate stalking position, its spine roughly parallel to the floor, its skull dipped low enough to permit some nice dino selfies.

Now “T. rex: The Ultimate Predator,” a new exhibition that will run through the summer of 2020, gives an up-to-date view of everyone’s favorite prehistoric pugilist, and also introduces the many other tyrannosaurs that preceded T. rex, some discovered only this century in China and Mongolia. Along with a cast of the T. rex specimen upstairs, its bones rearranged into an alternative crouch, the museum is presenting a new full-size model of the emperor dinosaur, its head and tail dappled with — believe it! — soft, bristly white feathers.

Claws and toe bones more than 60 million years old share space with facsimiles of the newest vintage; this is the first show for which the natural history museum has extensively used 3-D printing, not just traditional casting, to reproduce specimens in other collections. There’s also a mildly whiz-bang virtual reality game, which tasks you with reconstructing a T. rex skeleton. You’ll then cower in terror as it comes to life. It will delight older children, and enrage kids too young to wear the headsets.

T. rex emerged about 65 million years ago, at the very end of the Cretaceous. It lived on a planet of high temperatures, when the air was thick with carbon dioxide, and while some dinosaurs were content to munch grass, others would be happy to find a baby T. rex or two for hors d’oeuvres. An adorable model here of a young T. rex, hardly bigger than a Christmas goose, reveals just how hazardous dino-childhood would have been, and how quickly the species grew. Most T. rexes never made it past age 1, but those who did could later put on 100 pounds a month or more, maturing into an 18,000-pound tough guy, or girl. (There’s no saying what sex a T. rex is; fossils give few hints of whether a dinosaur was male or female, and some researchers question whether the limited number of specimens provides enough evidence to make sex distinctions.)</TEXT>

      <TEXT>It has a lot to do with it. I think there are three key things that have contributed to the changing politics of climate change, Michael. One, as you said, absolutely — just in the past year or two alone, there have been major new reports that say, clearly and definitively, a lot of the extreme weather events that we are seeing now are caused by climate change. Second thing is polling shows that millennials, who will soon be the largest voting demographic — that this is an issue they care about more than almost anything else. That’s a big change. The third thing, I think, that politicians are paying attention to is President Trump. President Trump has made climate change an issue because he has elevated climate policy. He has said he’s going to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement. He’s rolling back climate change regulations. He mocks climate science. So all of those present a clear way for his prospective opponents to carve out a strong position against him.

Schumer is a politician, and so he sees that there is all of this millennial energy around the Green New Deal and around climate change. And he’s looking at the fact that people are asking questions about this when candidates go out to town halls in a way that they never have. So he wants to harness all this energy. He wants to make sure that millennials who care about climate change are still excited about Democrats and don’t think that these are fogies of yesteryear. But he wants to find a way to pivot away from the Green New Deal and come up, essentially, with a real piece of legislation that would be, probably, a lot more realistic and something that candidates could live with and that could be brought up on the Senate floor after an election.</TEXT>

It’s a strange reality when the same product is being used for both life’s biggest medical challenges and to prevent hangovers. But that’s where we are with CBD, sa id Dr. Rachna Patel, the author of “The CBD Oil S olution,” who began prescribing medical marijuana in 2012.

“Typically the way it works is you have a medicine, there is research done on it, scientists figure out what it works for, then people use it,” she said. “It’s the opposite with CBD. People are using it, and then they are like, ‘It works for this,’ and now science needs to study it.”

CBD may be hype. It may be placebo. It may be a miracle cure. Legislation could shut it all down at any moment. But in the current culture, the Stanleys have a huge advantage.

Since the beginning of 2018, Charlotte’s Web has experienced a 60 percent growth in sales online. The product is now found in 3,700 stores across the United States. The company is forecasting revenue growth of $120 to $170 million in 2019, up from $15 million in 2016.

Each brother has contributed something different to its success. “One of the best public speakers I’ve ever heard in my life is my older brother Josh,” Joel said. “When we have a TED Talk, we may write the content, but he gives it. Jesse is one of the funniest people I’ve ever met in my life. He’s hilarious, but he’s also creative so he does the marketing. Jon is the dead sexy one. Jon, Jordan, they take on the grunt of planting, learning how to deal with pests, teaching the farmers what to do. Jared is the most valuable operator. He should have been Forbes 30 under 30, but now he’s too old. He’s the one that does all the scaling. J. Austin, he handles scheduling, opportunities and events. Everyone loves him.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>At the age of 12, Patrick Pruniaux stole an erotic comic book belonging to his father. So began a lifelong appreciation of the work of the Italian artist and writer Milo Manara.

Thirty-four years on, that consideration has extended to a collaboration between Ulysse Nardin, the Swiss watch house that Mr. Pruniaux has led since 2017, and Mr. Manara, now 76, who is renowned for his erotic illustrations.

The result is a collector’s dream: the Classico Manara, a limited-edition watch featuring 10 vignettes by Mr. Manara that depict an enchanted love story between a mermaid and her earthly companion. The set was introduced in January at the Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie in Geneva.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>As in many dystopian novels, the narrative hints at its back story through the ominous appearance in the text of unexplained proper nouns — the Change, the Breeders, the Others — before revealing that an environmental cataclysm has produced rising sea levels and extreme weather across the globe. Britain, which has been spared the worst, uses the Wall — a literal Brexit — to keep out both water and unwanted immigrants. As Kavanagh makes modest plans for his future, falls in love and finds small forms of consolation, there are shades of Kazuo Ishiguro’s “Never Let Me Go,” but trouble lies ahead, and the second half turns into an ordeal that evokes Cormac McCarthy’s “The Road.”

Like most of its literary precursors, “The Wall” opens long after the Change, which allows Lanchester to present his society as a given, without having to worry about the details of the transition — a luxury granted to novelists, if not politicians. The catastrophe evidently happened over a short period of time, creating a historical dividing line as decisive as the Wall itself, and everyone knows whose fault it was: “The world hadn’t always been like this and … the people responsible for it ending up like this were our parents — them and their generation.”

This kind of moral clarity has little to do with the real devastation wrought by climate change, which promises to be just gradual enough to allow those who caused it to avoid blame during their lifetimes. Lanchester’s vision of an agonized cultural reckoning seems like its own sort of wishful thinking, and even if we grant his premise, many of his conclusions — like the notion that most people would stop having babies out of sheer guilt — are less than persuasive. Yet if the novel succeeds only intermittently as a parable, it’s gripping as a story, especially when it leaves the Wall. As Lanchester puts distance between himself and his gigantic symbol, the plot grows less constrained, and the last hundred pages are full of tense action and sudden reversals that are mercifully unburdened by any allegorical significance.

The result marks a step forward for Lanchester, a formidably intelligent author who has sometimes stumbled over his undeniable gifts. His debut, “The Debt to Pleasure,” was so pleased by its Nabokovian conceit — a murderer’s confession posing as a cookbook — that it settled for a series of variations on the same dark joke. More recently, “Capital” was a credible effort at a big social novel that was so densely reported that its characters barely had room to interact or change.

For a certain type of realistic novelist, a shift to speculative fiction — which allows the writer to invent as well as observe — can be liberating. “The Wall” revels in this opportunity, but it occasionally falters under Lanchester’s decision, which echoes “Never Let Me Go,” to keep most of his people slightly colorless, as if to contrast their ordinary inner lives with their horrific situations. In practice, the narrator’s restricted voice prevents us from seeing his world as clearly as we should, and we learn frustratingly little about its most vulnerable actors — the climate refugees on the far side of the Wall.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>MEXICO CITY — Mexico’s Congress on Thursday approved the creation of a 60,000-member National Guard to tackle the nation’s public security crisis, a force that President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has made a cornerstone of his plan to confront organized crime and curb soaring violence.

The vote capped months of legislative wrangling over the nature of the force and who would control it, with human-rights activists and civil society groups lobbying fiercely to limit the military’s influence on it and warning it could represent the further militarization of policing in Mexico.

In the end, Congress decided the National Guard would have an explicitly civilian, rather than military, character, with the new force lodged under the authority of the civilian Ministry of Security and Citizen Protection.

The makeup of the force would be a hybrid, combining officers from the Federal Police with members of the army and navy’s policing units. While military members of the force would be able to maintain their ranks, those accused of abuses would be tried in civilian courts. The force’s top commander could be a military official but would report to a civilian boss.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Attorney General Xavier Becerra of California announced Tuesday that his office would not bring criminal charges against two police officers who shot and killed an unarmed black man in Sacramento last year.

The decision, which came days after the Sacramento County district attorney said she would not bring charges against the officers, seemed likely to ignite more outrage after waves of protests over the killing of the man, Stephon Clark, 22, in his grandmother’s backyard.

Mr. Becerra said the video evidence reviewed by his team showed that the officers “reasonably believed” they were in danger, which is the applicable legal standard in the case.

Later on Tuesday, federal authorities released a statement saying that they would investigate whether the shooting had violated Mr. Clark’s civil rights.</TEXT>

TRENTON — A monthslong effort to legalize marijuana in New Jersey collapsed on Monday after Democrats were unable to muster enough support for the measure, derailing a central campaign pledge by Gov. Philip D. Murphy and leaving the future of the legalization movement in doubt.

The failure in the Legislature marks one of the biggest setbacks for Mr. Murphy, who, despite having full Democratic control in the State Senate and Assembly, has faced constant party infighting and has struggled to convince lawmakers of his progressive agenda.

Among the most vocal opponents were a handful of African-American Democratic lawmakers who split with their party over legalization, arguing that it would be a public health menace to their communities.

The abrupt unraveling of the campaign to legalize marijuana also reflected how some lawmakers were swayed by the challenges faced by other states that have legalized cannabis, including how to keep the drug away from teenagers and prevent people from driving under its influence.</TEXT>

Federal immigration officials appear to have cleared out an enclosure under a bridge in El Paso where they were detaining hundreds of families of asylum seekers, following an outcry over the conditions at the site.

But authorities appeared to have shifted some processing of migrants to another site on the other side of the bridge, using a military-style tent near an existing processing facility operated by Customs and Border Protection. A smaller number of migrants could be seen at that site late Sunday afternoon.

Separately, a spokesman for Customs and Border Protection said on Sunday that the agency was “in the process of transferring all of the illegal aliens being held temporarily” at the original enclosure under the bridge to a processing station in northeast El Paso. The spokesman said that the decision was made “to relocate to a location with more space and more shelter capability.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. — Rory McIlroy’s Sunday drive at TPC Sawgrass was far from leisurely. He spent most of the final round of the Players Championship stuck in his lane in a logjam, pumping his brakes while players grew larger in his rearview mirror.

Eddie Pepperell, who started Sunday six strokes behind McIlroy, caught him, and so, fleetingly, did Jhonattan Vegas, who also began the round six behind him. Early on, McIlroy, who himself began the day trailing Jon Rahm by one, was passed on the leader board by Abraham Ancer, who came from three off his pace. Down the stretch, Jim Furyk, who came from four back, inched ahead.

In contrast to last year, when Webb Simpson squeezed all the drama from the finish with a four-stroke victory, Sunday was a knock-down-drag-out race to the wire, with eight players holding at least a share of the lead — including Vegas for 16 seconds — before McIlroy took command.

McIlroy did not panic when he carded a double bogey on the fourth hole and made the turn in a one-over-par 37. While everyone around him spun out or ran out of road, McIlroy put together four birdies, against one bogey, on the back nine for a final-round two-under 70, good for a one-stroke victory.</TEXT>

On Friday, SJM Concerts, the tour’s promoter, issued a statement saying the tour had been canceled and that full refunds would be issued to ticket holders by Monday.

On Feb. 13, The New York Times reported allegations that Mr. Adams had repeatedly manipulated and harassed women in the music industry, offering to jump-start their careers only to pursue them sexually and in some cases retaliate if they spurned him.

[Read The New York Times report here.]

      <TEXT>Later, as congressional hearings gave way to a federal investigation, Republicans would attack the inquiry outright.

“Lawrence Walsh’s bungling Iran-contra operation has struck out again,” said the Senate minority leader, Bob Dole, slamming the independent counsel who led a yearslong investigation of the affair. “Unfortunately, the American taxpayers continue to be the real losers, watching their tax dollars going down the drain to maintain Mr. Walsh’s exercise in futility.”

The public might have been initially skeptical of President Reagan’s claims of ignorance, but Republican unity in the face of intense scrutiny kept that from spiraling into a full-blown political crisis. Reagan left office on a high note, with 63 percent approval in December 1988 . Nor did the scandal derail Bush, who won the presidency just a month before.

For the 22 months of Robert Mueller’s inquiry into Trump and his associates, Republicans have followed an almost identical approach. They’ve stuck by his side, shielding him from congressional investigators and defending his public conduct. Unlike Nixon, and to a greater extent than Reagan, Trump has also had the help of a powerful conservative media ecosystem ready to amplify his rhetoric, attack his political adversaries and even provide material for his verbal assaults.

If Mueller’s inquiry had ended with a bombshell revelation like the one in Watergate — where Nixon essentially confessed to obstruction of justice on tape, asking the director and the deputy director of the C.I.A. to pressure the F.B.I. into ending its investigation of the break-in — this protective strategy might have collapsed against the force of the facts. Instead, the report, at least as summarized by Attorney General William Barr, landed with a thud.

Barr clears Trump of wrongdoing, using Mueller’s inability to “establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities” to conclude that neither Trump nor his campaign “conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.”

Barr — who recommended pardons for key actors in Iran-contra as attorney general for George H.W. Bush in 1991 and who ruled out charging a president with obstruction in an unsolicited June 2018 memo — also determined that the “evidence developed” during the investigation “is not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.”

Instead of ending in drama like Watergate, the Russia scandal is likely to fade away like Iran-contra. There is still a report to read — reportedly more than 300 pages long — but President Trump has already declared victory. He is now a little less damaged ahead of his re-election campaign, a testament to how belligerence, shamelessness and partisanship can undermine any attempt to hold a president or his allies accountable for wrongdoing.

      <TEXT>But the hours of discussion that preceded the desultory procedural vote marked the most extensive examination of climate change on the Senate floor in years. The fight also took on larger dimensions as a proxy for the 2020 presidential battle, with Republicans charging that liberals intend to raise energy costs and devastate middle-class livelihoods, and Democrats blasting their counterparts for climate denial and inaction on an issue most Americans agree is serious.

The day of drama included Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, exhibiting a poster of former President Ronald Reagan astride a dinosaur in an effort to treat the Green New Deal with “the seriousness it deserves.” Mr. McConnell dismissed the plan as a “science-fiction novel.” Outside the Senate, environmental activists chanted: “What do we want? A Green New Deal. When do we want it? Now!” even as they clarified that they did not actually want the Senate to pass this particular Green New Deal resolution at this precise moment.

“To ordinary people, climate change is not politics. It’s life and death,” said Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and a sponsor of the Senate version of the Green New Deal. Mr. Markey accused Republicans of trying to “sabotage” efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions and predicted that “they will pay a price at the ballot box in 2020.”

Still, the maneuvering ultimately allowed both parties to declare political victory.

Democrats said they intended to move forward on a number of fronts. In the House, a senior Democratic leadership aide said lawmakers would introduce sweeping legislation this week to require the Trump administration to stay in the Paris Agreement on climate change and create a plan for meeting the United States’ commitment to the global climate deal.

In the Senate, Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, and Brian Schatz of Hawaii will announce a new special committee on climate change. Democrats are also expected to push to prioritize climate change in coming legislation on infrastructure and a deal to raise spending caps.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>BEAUREGARD, Ala. — Days after ferocious tornadoes killed almost two dozen people and devastated block after block of eastern Alabama, officials warned Wednesday that the state should brace for the possibility of more trouble this weekend.

“We have another storm system, very powerful, that will begin entering the state” on Saturday, Kevin Laws, a National Weather Service meteorologist, said at a news conference in the county where 23 people were killed on Sunday. “Most of the entire state’s going to be under a significant risk.”

The Weather Service’s Storm Prediction Center issued a separate forecast that showed much of the South, including Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana and the Carolinas, in at least some jeopardy over the weekend. Meteorologists, who predicted Sunday’s outbreak with striking precision, are expected to refine their forecast in the coming days.

Mr. Laws said there was a possibility that the eastern half of Alabama, which includes the communities that were hit hardest last weekend, would ultimately face “somewhat more of a minimal risk.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>MOSCOW — A Russian court on Monday sentenced a Muslim human rights activist to four years in a penal colony on drug possession charges widely seen as manufactured to further a crackdown on dissent in the Chechnya region.

The activist, Oyub Titiev, 61, had worked for years investigating allegations of abuse ranging from torture to murder under the increasingly autocratic rule of the Chechen leader, Ramzan Kadyrov.

Mr. Kadyrov publicly called Mr. Titiev a junkie after his arrest in January 2018.

“Drug addicts were arrested in Chechnya by the thousands, and no one came to their defense,” Mr. Kadyrov said on Chechen television at the time. But as soon as Mr. Titiev was arrested, he complained, “the entire world rose up.”

The organization where Mr. Titiev worked, a local branch of the Memorial Human Rights Center, was placed on a Russian government registry of “foreign agents” in 2014.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>But the Pentagon says that most serving troops won’t be affected. A 2016 survey found that about 9,000 troops identified as transgender, but as of last month, only about 1,000 had begun the formal transitioning process.

The official at the briefing said the policy simply added gender dysphoria, which he called “a serious mental condition,” to the long list of pre-existing conditions, from asthma to heel spurs, that would disqualify someone from serving.

“Any service member with a medical condition, such as gender dysphoria, has a potential negative impact on force readiness and should be evaluated,” the official said. “All service members, equally, must meet established readiness standards to maintain the effectiveness and lethality of the force.”

Transgender people have been allowed to serve openly and transition in the military since a longtime ban was lifted in 2016, and they now serve around the globe. Transgender recruits have been allowed to enlist since the start of 2018. The new policy allows the military to grant waivers to transgender recruits, though the experiences of current recruits suggests that waivers may be difficult to get.

With the new policy set to take effect April 12, some transgender troops and recruits are rushing to sign enlistment papers or start the transitioning process before the deadline, according to Navy Lt. Cmdr. Blake Dremann, who heads Sparta, an association of transgender troops that opposes the policy change.

“There is a sense of urgency, and we are working very quickly,” Commander Dremann said.

After Mr. Trump’s announcement, opponents mounted five separate court challenges, and court injunctions in those cases kept the 2016 policy allowing transgender military service in place.

Most have since been lifted. On Wednesday, the Departments of Justice and Defense said the last remaining injunction no longer applied, but Mr. Minter, the plaintiff in that case, has challenged that claim. Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the Federal District Court in the District of Columbia has set a deadline of Friday for the government to respond to the challenge, and has not ruled on the status of the injunction.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>You’ve covered George W. Bush, President Obama, and President Trump for The Times. Before that you also, for The Associated Press, covered Clinton, George H.W. Bush, and Reagan. How has it been different covering each of them?

Every administration is different. You try to build a relationship of trust with every administration — that they know you’re doing your job fairly and have no agenda. Every administration, every president, treats photographers differently.

Reagan was an actor, so when he went on stage he had this charisma and he would light up. His personality just grew as he spoke and as he gestured.

Bush 41 had one of the closest relationships with photographers because he was vice president for eight years before becoming president. He knew a lot of us by first names and had a nickname for us, “photo dogs.” He would invite us to play horseshoes with him and to go jogging with him. He wasn’t trying to play us, that was just his personality. He respected what we did.

When Clinton came in it was a totally different feel. We had plenty of access. He was very energetic and never stopped working. He loved rope lines, knew they made for great pictures and he seemed to get energy from going into a crowd and staying there for 30-40 minutes shaking hands after an event.

His relationship with photographers was not as close as it was with Bush 41 and after the Lewinsky scandal there was less access.

Because of his dad, Bush 43 really liked photographers. He’d also call us photo dogs. He was very athletic and would invite photographers to bike ride with him. He liked to hang out and talk to reporters and photographers at times, just to feel them out, mostly off the record while on the plane or at social events. He was a lot of fun to photograph. He didn’t have the stage presence of other presidents, but he was a character and would do things that made for good pictures.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“I didn’t want to give up this Georgian art in New York,” said Mr. Katchakhidze, who repaired the murals and built frames around them as part of a recently completed renovation. “Now, if anybody wants to see Georgian feasts, or picnics in the forest in the 17th century, they don’t have to go to the galleries or museums — they just go to the restaurant.”

That renovation included some updates to the menu: In addition to seeking out spices from Georgia, Mr. Katchakhidze and his team pulled new recipes from some of that nation’s oldest cookbooks, published in the early 1800s. They carefully studied the recipe for chanakhi, a traditional lamb and eggplant stew, to ensure they were using the right kind of onions (red, medium-sweet). Their chanakhi is cooked in a traditional clay pot, topped with a sheet of dough that retains the stew’s moisture and flavor, and puffs up above the dish in a dramatic dome.

Those with a nominal interest in either Georgian food or molten cheese already know the Adjaruli khachapuri, a boat-shaped pastry filled with salty cheese and topped with a raw egg that’s swirled tableside to create a molten center. Pirosmani happily serves it, but “when you have that, you are full and you cannot have anything else,” Mr. Katchakhidze said. So he also offers Imeretian kachapuri, which lands somewhere between a calzone and a double-crusted pie, and plays nicely with other dishes. The dough, made with kefir, is airy and tender. The simplest version, packed with three types of cheese, is perhaps the easiest legal way to achieve a dopamine surge.

To front-load a feast of cheese pies and meat stews with a few vegetables, you’ll want to try the badrijanis pkhali, thin and smoky eggplant strips wrapped around an almost ricottalike filling of blitzed walnuts, garlic, chicken broth and fenugreek.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>In addition to greenhouse gas emissions, the food system has environmental challenges, like overtaxed agricultural lands; the dead zones that form each year in the Gulf of Mexico, fueled by nutrient runoff from Midwestern fields growing animal feed; and the pollution associated with concentrated animal feeding operations, or so-called factory farms.

Consuming lots of meat is also making people in the United States and other affluent nations unwell, according to a recent report on sustainable diets in the medical journal The Lancet. People in the United States would be better off eating much less red meat, the report said, while those in undernourished parts of the world, like South Asia, would benefit from eating more.

The World Cancer Research Fund has said that limiting red meat to 3.5 ounces — a little less than a quarter-pound burger — no more than three times a week reduces cancer risk. Going lower than that, sticking to one 3.5-ounce serving of red meat a week, reduced related greenhouse gas emissions by nearly half, the Lancet report said.

Dr. Peters published a study in 2016 that suggested that a lacto-ovo diet, which contains dairy and eggs, might be the most sustainable while also providing proper nutrition.

But at a high level, even a lacto-ovo diet necessitates the creation of at least some meat. A laying hen can live six years or longer, but stops laying eggs efficiently after a year. A cow can live up to 20 years, but milk production for most cows drops somewhere between the ages of 5 and 8. Not slaughtering them for meat would mean a commitment to keeping them alive — and committing the resources to do so — for quite some time. It may be more efficient to simply eat them.

If all of this sounds messy, it is. Researchers generally agree that agriculture is one of the hardest parts of the economy to decarbonize; it’s not just about lowering greenhouse gas emissions, but also about keeping the world fed.

The question, Dr. Peters said, boils down to finding sustainable ways of producing food that meet both the food security needs of the United States and the many other nations that depend on it for exports.

“It would be very safe to say that eating less meat is going to make it easier to accommodate a larger number of people on the planet, and every study I’ve seen is pointed to that,” Dr. Peters said. “The question is by how much, and how quickly does that need to change?”

      <TEXT>ROCK HILL, S.C. — Somewhere between Pete Buttigieg being mistaken for a teenager making a promposal, and answering a question in Norwegian, and proclaiming that it was millennials’ turn to lead “at the highest level,” South Carolina got a crash course in a new Democratic celebrity.

Mr. Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Ind., drew large, enthusiastic crowds in his first campaign visit to the early-voting state over the weekend. That followed a series of well-received appearances on national TV, which have helped fuel his new popularity: An Iowa poll on Monday showed him jumping to third place in the 2020 caucus race, and a Quinnipiac national poll on Thursday showed him rising to fifth and tied with Senator Elizabeth Warren.

“This was supposed to be a little meet-and-greet Q. and A.,” he told hundreds of people in a college gym in Rock Hill, after his event was bumped from the library to accommodate a wave of RSVPs.

[Our On Politics newsletter took a look at the ‘Buttigieg boomlet.’]

Many Democrats have drawn impressive crowds early this presidential cycle, a reflection of Democrats’ pent-up desire to defeat President Trump. But Mr. Buttigieg, a Rhodes scholar and a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, was largely an afterthought in a field of much better-known hopefuls. His national TV appearances built on an online following he developed with detailed, earnest and sometimes personal answers at events in Iowa and New Hampshire this winter, and his outside-the-box progressive stands on some policies.</TEXT>

The announcement on Tuesday of architecture’s highest award was seen by many as a long overdue honor for this 87-year-old architect, urban designer and theorist, who is credited with fusing East and West, modern and postmodern, and global and local in a visually diverse body of work that symbolized Japan’s global influence. Mr. Isozaki’s more than 100 buildings include the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, the Palau Sant Jordi in Barcelona and the Qatar National Convention Center in Doha.

At his modest apartment in Naha, the capital of Okinawa, Mr. Isozaki said he was “overjoyed” to receive the prize.</TEXT>

Seth Meyers and Stephen Colbert scoffed at the news that President Trump had donated a portion of his salary to the Department of Homeland Security. Each called the move hypocritical — but for different reasons.

Colbert pointed out that Trump was simultaneously proposing to cut the department’s budget, and Meyers’s critique was even more straightforward.

“His most recent proposal for wall funding would take $5 billion away from the Department of Homeland Security budget. So, Trump’s paycheck donation is like robbing a restaurant, then on your way out throwing a nickel in the tip jar. [impersonating Trump] ‘Here you go. Buy yourself something nice, like an alarm system.’” — STEPHEN COLBERT “President Trump yesterday tweeted a picture of a signed check that he wrote donating $100,000 of his annual salary to the Department of Homeland Security. Of course, if you want to give part of your salary to the government, you could just pay your taxes.” — SETH MEYERS</TEXT>

      <TEXT>There has been plenty of pushback on the decision, with Nadal and Federer both pointing out that they were not consulted by Djokovic or council members in the run-up to the Kermode decision. Federer said he had reached out directly to Djokovic who had been unable to find time on his schedule for a discussion.

But then neither Nadal nor Federer are on the council at this stage, although both have served in the past. Federer, a former president, has acknowledged that the role can be draining, particularly in fraught times, and Djokovic spoke about that challenge on Sunday after defeating American Bjorn Fratangelo in his opening match.

“I care about the current generation and also the future generation and future of this sport,” Djokovic said. “I think that the sport is doing well, but it can also do better and better, you know, as we go along. And if I, with my status and with my position in the world of sport and tennis, can influence that positively, then why not? Yes, it takes away in energy and time, but I know I do it from the right place in my heart and with the right intent, and then I also receive a lot of energy for that.”

He has received some criticism, too, but appears intent on trying to push for structural reforms on the ATP Tour, which could include dividing Kermode’s role into two separate positions, or changing the size or composition of the board.

Success is far from guaranteed considering the internal tensions that exist in the ATP: an organization that is a long-running and often uneasy partnership between the players and those who own and operate the tournaments.

It would be all too easy to get distracted.

But some rejected any such speculation on Tuesday and emphasized Kohlschreiber’s performance. Among them: Nick Kyrgios, the unpredictable and intermittently committed Australian who won a hardcourt title in Mexico last week in style but was beaten, 6-4, 6-4, by Kohlschreiber in the second round here.

“Something has to be wrong with him right?” Kyrgios tweeted on Tuesday, referring to Djokovic. “I lose to Kholi and get absolutely shredded ‘same old kyrgios’ how about the guy is just good? And he knows how to win matches? Hate this, why we always gotta kiss these guys when they lose?”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Yeah. Because the roof leaks and nobody has the money to fix it. So partly you can’t stand around and say, “Do more! Do more! Do more!” and not give them some more money to be able to do it with. But the second one I particularly want to focus on higher ed, because there’s a lot of work here. This is a place where your tax dollars have been put at risk through the student loan program. And yet right now the Department of Education is letting for profit colleges, for example, just siphon those dollars off into, at best, substandard educational experiences for many, many, many students. And the consequence of that is that people get saddled with huge debt and very little increase in their income potential and their lives are destroyed because those debts are not dischargeable in bankruptcy. So right off the top, this fight is right on the table about how much the federal government should insist on higher standards for anyone to be able to get access — for any school to be able to get access to the federal student loan program. And understand for most of these for profit colleges, they can’t operate without federal student loan money. They target principally two groups: young people who went straight from high school to the military and now have good benefits as they come out and are ready, after maybe having served four years or six years. They want to come out. They want to get a college degree. They pounce on those kids and they pounce on single moms working two jobs. Read the ads in the subway. And they pitch them on the idea that their children, the children of college graduates do better than the children of non-college graduates. So people sign up who are not always very sophisticated about the colleges and they get deep in debt for very substandard educational programs. This is a place where right now Betsy DeVos, your secretary of education, is lowering the standards day by day so that for profit colleges can rip off more students. That is outrageous.</TEXT>

It has a surprising history and an uncertain future, as the nation awaits a ruling by the Supreme Court. “What it has become to mean is districts that I don’t like because somebody else drew them.” The former steel town of Tarentum in western Pennsylvania is a mix of working-class Republicans and Democrats. Former Congressman Jason Altmire says that’s given him a close-up view of how gerrymandering works. “When I was in office, if you lived in this house you were my constituent. But if you lived on this side, your congressman was 60 miles away in Johnstown, Pa. It’s a small town. They’re in the same school district. They’re one community, except for the fact they were represented by two different members of Congress.” In the decade after each new census, states redraw their congressional and legislative districts. The party in power, whether Republican or Democrat typically draws maps to protect its own members. “Well, if you’re right there on that line, and that border, and if it’s a crazy district, it can become very confusing.” “But gerrymandering isn’t a partisan problem. We see this in other states like Maryland where it’s been the Democrats in power and the Democrats drawing the map to essentially marginalize Republican power.” “Gerrymandering doesn’t just determine how many Democrats and Republicans will serve. It determines what kind of Democrats and Republicans. It contributes to polarization. It makes the more liberal Democrats more likely to win. It makes the more conservative Republicans more likely to win. And they are less likely to cooperate with each other, and that gets us to the politics we have now.” “If you’re a member of Congress representing that type of district, you don’t hear different points of view. You hold a town hall meeting and all you ever hear is, ‘Right on, keep doing what you’re doing, and don’t you dare compromise.’” Both parties have long played the redistricting game. But today’s hard-fought battles have their origins 30 years ago, when the Supreme Court rendered a decision that upended the political landscape. “And in one unanimous decision today, the court said that North Carolina’s redistricting plan violated the 1982 Voting Rights Act by reducing black voting power.” The court ruled that under the Voting Rights Act, minority groups should have the opportunity to elect their preferred candidates to Congress. “Need your help!” The remedy? New majority-minority districts, where minority residents of voting age made up more than 50 percent of the population. “In several states, new snake-like district lines were drawn, linking together small pockets of black voters.” “I feel like things are changing in the right direction.” “Just want to say hello to you. I’m running for Congress.” In the 1992 elections, the new majority-minority districts achieved their goal, and 17 new black representatives were elected to Congress. “The new Congress looks more like America than any other Congress in history.” “Hello, America!” One of them was a North Carolina lawyer and activist named Eva Clayton. “From 1901 to 1992, no Afro-American had ever represented North Carolina. So that was a beautiful, historical moment.” “We too sing America.” “I felt privileged, I felt honored, and I felt humbled and blessed.” But for the Democrats, who still controlled the redistricting process, there was a price to pay. By packing black voters into a limited number of districts, there were fewer Democrats everywhere else. And Republicans saw an opportunity to divide and conquer. “Let me tell you that the Voting Rights Act has the potential to really shake things up and frankly it is frightening to the Democrats.” “Very quickly, the Republican politicos figured out that if you drew three minority-majority districts, it meant that there were three incredibly Democrat districts, which meant there were more Republicans in the other eight or 10 districts.” “So the Republicans went to the African-American community, largely Democratic, and said, ‘Let’s make a deal.’” “In South Carolina, blacks and Republicans are already talking about a crescent-shaped district through the southern part of the state.” “The alliance, when it comes to redistricting, between the Republicans, mostly in the South, and the African-Americans, mostly in the South, has been called ‘The unholy alliance.’ Certainly, the Republicans knew what they were doing. The first sign of what a big deal the unholy alliance was was the 1994 elections.” “We will keep our commitment to keep our half of the contract with the help of the American people.” “There’s a new wind blowing, and it is a majority for Republicans.” “You saw the white Democrats in the South losing seat after seat.” “Voters sweep Democrats from power in midterm elections and give Republicans control of the House and Senate for the first time in 40 years.” “So it’s an irony. More African-American districts meant less Democrats were elected.” “I don’t think the African-American community was out to destroy the Democratic Party, but they were out to get the representation they thought they were entitled to. What happened was, it led to complete Republican dominance of virtually every state south of the Mason-Dixon line.” “So it’s sort of like taking our fight against racism, and the advancements we’ve made and the laws we’ve used and literally turning them around on their head and saying, ‘These are the laws you want and you fought for? Fine. We’re going to implement them 150 percent and see if you like that.’” “Let me hold the map.” Angela Bryant served in the North Carolina legislature from one of the carefully drawn majority-minority districts. “What’s on the left side is in my district. It’s one of the few trailer parks that’s still in the city.” The lines can get complicated, even for a seasoned legislator. “So I’m going to stop here and get my bearing. This road is sort of the boundary. And this is what I can’t tell, if these are in or out. It always bothered me, in terms of gerrymandering, that there was what I call ‘a finger’ that scooped down into what was otherwise my district that interrupted the compactness and scooped out the wealthier households, which are more white and Republican. In a micro sense, both me and my community benefited from the racial gerrymander, in that I got to represent them. However, in the big sense, it rendered us powerless in that the surrounding white communities and representatives didn’t need us, and they could label our party as the black party.” Having lost their voting strength, Democrats are now running up against the reality that Republicans are firmly in control of mapmaking in a majority of states. “The map drawers create a map which is perhaps likely to elect 10 Republicans and three Democrats. I acknowledge freely that this would be a political gerrymander, which is not against the law.” “Come up with something different. It could be five Democratic seats.” “Democrats don’t like the fact that Republicans took over a lot of state legislatures, and what we’ve seen with Democrats across the country is to look for bogeymen under every rock they can to explain their electoral failures. And, of course, it is my opinion that Democrats want to use the courts to do what they can’t win at the ballot box, and that is elections.” Across the country, gerrymandering is facing challenges in court. In North Carolina in 2018, the courts ruled that Republicans had packed too many African-American voters into too few districts. “North Carolina is really ground zero for gerrymandering.” It was a victory for Democrats, but Angela Bryant’s district was a casualty. It was more compact now, but also much more Republican. Bryant decided not to run for re-election. “People say, ‘Oh, they pushed her out.’ They didn’t push me out. It’s a shift we helped design and we pushed for. The Republicans, they said, ‘You realize if you fight this you lose your district.’ And I’m saying, somehow you’re missing the point. I say, it’s not my district that’s important to me. I’m against racism. We’re insulted to have a district based on racial discriminatory practices.” “Black people are overwhelmingly Democrats. So the question is, is it in the interest of African-Americans to have African-American legislators elected? Or is it in the interest of African-Americans to have the party they belong to have power? You may not be able to have both.” Regardless of election outcomes or court decisions, America’s political divisions are unlikely to go away anytime soon. It has to do with where Americans live. “The problem that Democrats have is they have sorted themselves into like-minded communities, and it makes it very easy to draw lines that advantage the Republican Party because you can put all the Democrats into one single area. And that’s not something that’s going to change. That’s a social trend that is greater and more impactful than just gerrymandering.” “Here’s what the Democrats need to do to fix their problem. They need to go win people back over in areas they’ve lost, or they need to get the ones they have to move to other places.” “A Democrat would draw it differently. They would probably come here to Cumberland, divide it up and do something like this, and try to find a district by combining all over the state. I mean, they have lost voters and they don’t have voters in the right areas. I mean, that’s just what it is.” “In a democracy, what we have as a final tool are our votes. That’s how people express themselves.” Fifty years ago, before the days of majority-minority districts, Eva Clayton ran for Congress and lost. “When you find people who are in tears because you lost, then you know that you have not only stirred the emotions, but also the hope.” Today, Clayton feels that a minority candidate like herself can appeal to everyone. “I have hope that America has moved far enough that a Eva Clayton could get elected. Now I don’t know why Eva Clayton would want to run right now. But anyhow, I think I can make my case to anyone. I just need the opportunity to do that.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Gloria Brown didn’t get a good night’s sleep. Her husband, Arthur Brown, 79, has Alzheimer’s disease and had spent most of the night pacing their bedroom, opening and closing drawers, and putting on and taking off his jacket.

So Ms. Brown, 73, asked a friend to take her husband out for a few hours one recent afternoon so she could grab a much-needed nap. She was lucky that day because she didn’t need to call upon the home health aide who comes to their house twice a week.

Paying for help isn’t cheap: The going rate in the San Francisco Bay Area, where the Browns live, ranges from $25 to $35 an hour. Ms. Brown estimates she has spent roughly $72,000 on caregivers, medications and supplies since her husband was given his diagnosis four years ago.

“The cost can be staggering,” said Jim Patterson, a Republican state assemblyman from Fresno who is the author of a bill that would give family caregivers in California a tax credit of up to $5,000 annually to help offset their expenses.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Federer, the 20-time Grand Slam champion, became the second male player to win 100 tour-level tournaments in the professional era when he beat Stefanos Tsitsipas, 6-4, 6-4, in the final of the Dubai Championships on Saturday.

Jimmy Connors was the other player to reach the milestone, and he ended his career with 109 titles.

“Welcome to the ‘Triple Digit’ tournament victory club,” Connors said in a Twitter post to Federer. “I’ve been a bit lonely — glad to have the company!!!”

By beating a player nearly half his age, Federer, 37, continued his record of winning at least one title every season since his first in 2001 in Milan. Eight of his victories have come in Dubai.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>SAN FRANCISCO — The Wall Street Journal plans to join a new paid subscription news service run by Apple, according to two people familiar with the plans, as other publishers chafe at the terms that the Silicon Valley company is demanding of its partners.

Other major publishers, including The New York Times and The Washington Post, have opted out of joining the subscription service, said the people, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the plans.

Apple and The Wall Street Journal plan to announce the deal Monday at a media event at Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. The event is intended to draw attention to the company’s bet on news and entertainment, including a streaming service that will put Apple in direct competition with Netflix, Amazon and HBO.

The service, described by some as a “Netflix for news,” will offer access to a new paid tier of the Apple News app. Through that tier, readers will be able to consume articles from hundreds of participating magazines and news outlets. The app’s free tier will still let people read a smattering of select articles from a wide variety of publishers.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Miners down on their luck force themselves on women, lynch for sport and spend one long, frightening Fourth of July hunting as many people of color as possible. These horrors aren’t imagined; Mr. Sellars assembled the libretto from historical texts, including journals, poems and folk song lyrics of the time. For anyone worried about today, this opera seems to say, don’t be surprised: America has always been this way.

If only “Girls of the Golden West” lived up to its meaning to the American moment, or to the promise of its eminent creators. Its premiere, in 2017, received mixed reviews. I was torn, attracted to the score and singers — especially the soprano Julia Bullock and the mezzo-soprano J’Nai Bridges, two “Girls” of the title — but unable to get over a libretto that was sleepy, dramatically awkward and overly long.

Clearly aware of the opera’s problems, Mr. Adams spent last summer revising the score before it traveled to the Dutch National Opera with the same production, cast and conductor, Grant Gershon, this week. (A third stop is planned for a future season of the Dallas Opera.)

The first act got much-needed trims, and a new ending that links it to the opening of Act II. (Previously, the two acts felt as independent as a double bill.) Mr. Adams also cut the “Spider Dance,” an amusing diversion that should have an afterlife as a short orchestral work, like “The Chairman Dances” from his “Nixon in China.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>In the upwardly mobile East, the opposite is happening.

“We don’t cater to need, we cater to desire,” Mr. Vigneron said. “So more and more, pricing in luxury is an art in itself and you need to ensure the right product is available for customers at every entry point to the Cartier brand. People of all backgrounds are more than willing to buy into a dream, but it has to be at the right price.”

In an evermore competitive market, however, this also means meeting customers in new ways. For Cartier, that meant investing heavily in renovating key flagship locations, including New Bond Street in London, which reopened in December, and ensuring these stores could also be used for meetings and events. The house also has hosted several high-profile museum-style exhibitions of key pieces from its archives, and reconsidered its product introductions. To celebrate the unveiling of the new Santos de Cartier watch in San Francisco last year, for example, Cartier held three days of talks with modern-day creative figures, campaigners and entrepreneurs.

“As digital gets evermore important so, too, has sharing, learning and finding a community in the physical world, too. If a luxury brand can move beyond product and also facilitate those relationships as they then develop both on and offline, then it is a very powerful thing,” Mr. Vigneron said.

A greater focus on such encounters, and on data to understand market changes better and to identify potential customers and how to reach them, has become paramount, he said. So has adapting to client needs and desires as they are shaped by shifting societal trends.

“Traditionally, luxury has always been a very centralized business, both physically and philosophically,” Mr. Vigneron said. “The guardian of the temple will remain an artistic director, but today you also need to democratize and spread and test yourself across new markets — far beyond just your stores — in order to really resonate wherever you are.

“Inclusivity is critical to most many luxury shoppers who are shaping today’s industry.”

For Cartier, beyond building its local teams worldwide, this has meant experimenting by, for example, adapting its video and social media campaigns for different cultures (like deciding its Sofia Coppola-directed video was too provocative and creating a different video for Middle Eastern markets) or male celebrities (like Lu Han in China) to model high jewelry designs directed at women. A retail innovation lab to test new technologies has been opened in Brooklyn, with sites in Tokyo and Shanghai planned for later this year.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I don’t make geographical distinctions like that. I like to work with fascinating artists with vivid minds, with people that have an attractive creativity. And the world is global now, so I don’t think about American movies and European movies. Of course, there’s a specificity to the cultural background and the context of it all — but in the end, it’s storytelling. It always comes back to, what is life? And what are we as people doing in that life within the time that is given to us on this planet? I think it’s important to kick people in the heart every now and then.

Back then, one of our writers called you “the most versatile beefcake actor of our time.” Is being called a beefcake a compliment?

I don’t pay too much attention to descriptions of myself because I think every human being is in a permanent state of transformation and evolution. So I can understand that people perceived me that way at some point, and I can only hope that perception also transforms as I’m transforming myself. I definitely consider it a compliment, but I don’t sit on it too much. I’d rather keep moving.

What do you think is the secret of your own allure?

I like to be respectful toward people, and whether it’s a woman or a man or a crew member, I think kindness is very important. Not that I’m always kind. I can be the opposite of kind as well, but I don’t like version of myself. But I think I can obviously say that by nature, yeah, I have a kind heart.

You’re a co-owner of a Belgian casting agency that supports diversity. How did that happen?

I founded that because we live in a very multicultural society here in Belgium, and I hardly ever see that translated into our TV or cinematic landscape. Very few people in Belgium that have different cultural backgrounds find their way to a dramatic education. So I thought, man, we need to do something because the streets are filled with diamonds. There are so many talented people out there that should be discovered, and we need to create a platform for them to be revealed.

In a park across from Al Noor Mosque, where 42 worshipers were killed, traditional Friday Prayer became a communal event, drawing together Muslims from afar, relatives of the dead and New Zealanders in headscarves experiencing an Islamic service for the first time.

“This terrorist sought to tear our nation apart with an evil ideology that has torn the world apart — but instead we have shown that New Zealand is unbreakable,” Imam Gamal Fouda of Al Noor Mosque said, drawing applause from those gathered.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>MANILA — The Philippines’ top defense official said on Tuesday that the government should review a decades-old treaty with the United States, its longtime ally, to avoid provoking a potential armed conflict with China in the disputed South China Sea.

The security environment in the region has become “much more complex” since the countries’ Mutual Defense Treaty was drawn up 68 years ago, said the Philippine defense secretary, Delfin Lorenzana.

“The Philippines is not in a conflict with anyone and will not be at war with anyone in the future,” Mr. Lorenzana said.

Since President Trump took office, the United States has been conducting more frequent military patrols in disputed waters of the South China Sea, in an effort to counter China’s conversion of contested islands into military bases.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>8:50 a.m. Pick my looks. Between multiple workouts and being in front of the camera a few times during the day, I often have to style and pack two to five looks a day. Today I pack three outfits, including body wipes and on-the-go products to efficiently change in between meetings and workouts.

9 a.m. Pack all the snacks and all the food. I’m vegan, and I consume a lot of food to get me through the day. Today I’m bringing almonds, a Vega bar, an Athletic Greens packet (which I throw into a water bottle), Nuun tablets and a banana. I’ll probably eat all of that before lunch.

9:30 a.m. Do my own workout at a private training facility. I dedicate five to seven hours a week to strength, conditioning and running on my own. Nothing keeps you raw like picking up heavy things.

10:27 a.m. Lungs are burning so badly from my workout, it feels like I ingested fire. Quick shower and outfit change: I’m the master of being ready in under seven minutes. My hair is currently in braids, which marries style and efficiency.

10:42 a.m. Uber to Tread studio listening to “Nice for What,” by Drake.

11 a.m. Weekly senior staff meeting with Peloton’s chief content officer. I am snacking and hydrating. I drink more than a gallon of water a day.

1:40 p.m. Uber home while listening to music and making my playlist for my ’90s Pop Run tonight.

2 p.m. Continue researching music, making playlist for tonight, writing detailed class notes and creating the class plan. Each class playlist and class plan takes up to two hours of preparation. Peloton instructors are part D.J., part coach, part training partner. The class notes detail the workout, the songs, the exact timing of every part of the workout from warm-up to cool-down. There’s an art to it, just like a composer at an orchestra.

5 p.m. Check my blood sugar. I’m a Type 1 diabetic, so I’ve been checking it once an hour all day. I also adjust my insulin depending on how I’m moving and what I’m consuming throughout the day.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WASHINGTON — She paused to maintain her composure as she spoke. She recalled the attacks, and how her reports of them were handled. The despair, she said, almost made her leave the military.

Senator Martha McSally, Republican of Arizona and the first woman in the Air Force to fly in combat, told a hushed Senate hearing room on Wednesday that she had been raped by a superior officer, one of multiple times she was sexually assaulted while she served her country.

“I thought I was strong, but felt powerless,” Ms. McSally said during a Senate Armed Services subcommittee hearing on sexual assault in the military. “The perpetrators abused their position of power in profound ways.”

In sharing her experience — pride in her historic military service, betrayal over the assault and determination to help find a solution — the junior senator from Arizona offered one of the most powerful testimonies to date in the growing and heated debate on Capitol Hill over how to adjudicate claims of sexual assault in the military.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WASHINGTON — Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida came to Washington in 2017 with a reputation for bipartisan deal-cutting in the State Legislature — then spent a year idling behind the slow-moving minivans in the House Republican Conference like a Mustang stuck in traffic.

So he decided to go the full Trump. With a near-constant presence on the president’s favorite network and a penchant for own-the-libs outrageousness, Mr. Gaetz has, in short order, become the lawmaker Democrats love to loathe. It is all part of the plan.

“In a world where the body politic has the attention span at times of a goldfish, yep, you’ve got to have the ability to reinvent yourself in this game many times,” said Mr. Gaetz, who in his second term representing Florida’s western Panhandle has emerged as one of President Trump’s fiercest and most frequent defenders on Fox News, CNN and MSNBC.

“I did one cable news hit during my first 10 months in Congress,” he said during an interview in his Capitol Hill office last week. “Yeah. And now it’s only a couple of years later and The New York Times is sitting in my office asking me about my life. The only thing that’s changed is a little bit of time and a whole hell of a lot of cable.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand — The suspected gunman in last week’s attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, was charged with murder for the death of one victim — but the police announced on Thursday that that supposed victim was in fact alive.

A police spokesman said that the charge sheet would be corrected, with a new name, and legal experts said the mistake would not impede prosecution in the mass shooting that left 50 people dead.

“In our system there is a provision to amend the charge at any time, and the issue is whether the amendment is in the interest of justice,” said Jonathan Eaton, a lawyer and former prosecutor specializing in criminal law. “I will imagine there will be a fairly hasty effort to amend that charging document.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>That’s Japan on your left. The first thing you may notice, inside a glass case filled with musical instruments, is the eighth-century koto, a long, low instrument with strings sometimes played while sitting on the floor. Southeast Asia is on your right. What looks like a small crocodile is a 19th-century mi-gyaung, or crocodile zither, from Myanmar (when it was Burma).

Just beyond those cases are lutes, lyres, gongs, drums, horns, harps, whistles, Italian violins, Indonesian gamelans, lamellaphones from sub-Saharan Africa, a golden harpsichord seemingly supported by mythical creatures and keyboard instruments small enough to fit in your carry-on luggage.

This is Gallery 681, “Mapping the Art of Music,” an intimate second-floor space at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, which opened last month after a three-year makeover. (An exhibition of non-Western instruments was here before.)</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“Media Tips and Gulf Money Fuel Campaign to Sabotage Qatar’s Cup” (Sports pages, Feb. 2) implies that the challenges facing Qatar as host of FIFA’s 2022 World Cup are because of the current Gulf crises. However , the challenges facing Qatar 2022 predate the crises.

When Qatar was awarded the right in 2010 to host the World Cup, it was assumed it would usher in a period of bridge building, peace, prosperity and moderation in the Middle East. It turned out that it was anything but in the interests of the region. FIFA, which has been marred with accusations of corruption, found itself being used as a vehicle to advance the political agenda of Qatar.

Qatar is using the tournament to whitewash its image of being a host to Islamist extremists. Yet it continues to host such Islamists as Yusuf al-Qaradawi, who is barred from the United States and Britain . He has openly endorsed suicide attacks against Israelis (later reversing himself) and continues to be an ideological inspiration for Qatar’s regime. What Qatar laws and ethics dictate are in total contradiction to the FIFA Code of Ethics.

When FIFA decided to investigate allegations of corruption related to Qatar 2022, hopes were high that it would no longer tolerate corruption. Allegations of corruption that surfaced again in 2018 would tend to indicate that FIFA did an incomplete job.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>It's peak bird-watching season in North America. As millions of birds in the Americas migrate to their summer homes now through May, millions of bird-watchers are taking up binoculars and cameras to spot the Sandhill cranes, Red-Shouldered hawks and thousands of other species flying above.

But all year, hotels and resorts across the country have been taking notice of this nature-loving demographic, offering educational weekends, bird-watching tours and even full-time birders on staff. Others have taken efforts to preserve acres of land, establish birding trails and offer free bird-focused hikes.

Bird-watching tours did not exist before the 1970s, according to Kenn Kaufman, field editor for the National Audubon Society. “The interest in bird-watching has really exploded,” he said.

David La Puma, director of New Jersey Audubon’s Cape May Bird Observatory, said that many bed-and-breakfasts in the area now cater specifically to birders.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WASHINGTON — Dr. Norman E. (Ned) Sharpless, director of the National Cancer Institute, will serve as acting commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, Alex M. Azar III, secretary of health and human services, announced on Tuesday.

Dr. Sharpless temporarily will fill the post being vacated by Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who stunned public health experts, lawmakers and consumer groups last week when he abruptly announced that he was resigning for personal reasons.

Dr. Sharpless has been director of the cancer center, part of the National Institutes of Health, since October 2017. He is also chief of the aging biology and cancer section in the National Institute on Aging’s Laboratory of Genetics and Genomics. His research focuses on the relationship between aging and cancer, and development of new treatments for melanoma, lung cancer and breast cancer.

“Dr. Sharpless’s deep scientific background and expertise will make him a strong leader for F.D.A.,” said Mr. Azar, in a statement. “There will be no let up in the agency’s focus, from ongoing efforts on drug approvals and combating the opioid crisis to modernizing food safety and addressing the rapid rise in youth use of e-cigarettes.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>TORONTO — Whenever someone used to ask me if I was Muslim, I often gave an evasive answer, something like, “I was born Muslim” or “My parents are Muslim.”

It was a strange way to phrase it. I told myself that the purpose of this hairsplitting was intellectual clarity, despite the fact that I had attended a mosque my entire childhood, that I had read the Quran in both Arabic and English, and that I felt personally connected to the history of Islam. Perhaps this was the natural recourse for someone who came of age after 9/11 and was taught to retreat into invisibility because of the dangers of being Muslim. I knew, in my heart, that I was drawing the distinction only to appear safer to white people, to show that I was one of the good ones, worthy of belonging.

This was not just respectability politics: It was an act of self-erasure.

On Friday, nearly 50 of my fellow Muslims were massacred in cold blood in New Zealand. Not murdered but lynched, their deaths live-streamed to the sound of laughter. I long ago ceased to feel shocked at the violence directed against my community. But the heartbreak still comes.

The killer knew which day to pick. Friday is the Islamic Sabbath, when Muslims gather in the mosque to bow their heads in devotion to the divine. As they prayed, they might have been thinking about their children at school or what to make for dinner, unaware that soon their loved ones would be washing their bodies in accordance with Islamic tradition, preparing for the funeral prayer, the only one in Islam that has no Athan, or call to prayer, because the Athan was recited into their ears when they were born. When these Muslims saw the white stranger enter the mosque, they would have had the Islamic greeting on their tongues: “Assalamu alaikum.” Peace be upon you.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WASHINGTON — The Senate on Wednesday confirmed Chad A. Readler of Ohio as President Trump’s 33rd federal appeals court judge despite bipartisan criticism that as a Justice Department official in the Trump administration he had shirked his official responsibility to defend the Affordable Care Act when it was challenged in court.

Mr. Readler’s nomination is just the latest to divide the Senate as Republicans renew their drive to fill federal district and circuit court vacancies while gearing up to force through a Senate rules change to accelerate the confirmation process for the remainder of Mr. Trump’s tenure.

With the approval of Mr. Readler to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and two other appeals court nominees headed for a vote, Mr. Trump will have filled nearly 20 percent of the nation’s appellate court judgeships. That is a pace well ahead of his predecessors and one that puts his stamp firmly on the federal judiciary, with nearly two years remaining in his term. President Barack Obama did not see his 33rd circuit judge confirmed until early in his second term.

The fight over Mr. Readler was intensified by his role in the legal struggle over the Affordable Care Act, which Democrats said he was obligated to defend as a top lawyer in the Justice Department’s civil division because it was existing law. Instead, he filed a brief in support of a lawsuit by Republican attorneys general aimed at gutting the Affordable Care Act, and argued that it, and its protections against denying coverage for pre-existing conditions, was unconstitutional.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>From Beto O’Rourke to the president’s first veto, it’s been a busy week in American politics. Here are some of the biggest stories you might have missed (and some links if you’d like to read further).

Congress stood up to the president this week.

Three votes in Congress this week demonstrated a newfound willingness among some of Mr. Trump’s Republican allies to stand up to him.

The first came Wednesday, when the Senate again rebuked Mr. Trump for his defense of Saudi Arabia after the killing of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Senators voted for a second time to end American military assistance for the kingdom’s war in Yemen.

On Thursday, a dozen Republicans joined Senate Democrats to overturn President Trump’s national emergency declaration at the southwest border, delivering the second bipartisan rebuke of the week for what lawmakers in both parties deemed executive overreach. That led to the president’s first veto on Friday.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The man, a New York art dealer of Russian descent, Alexander Khochinsky, has refused, arguing he’ll only return it if the Polish government compensates him for its appropriation of his family’s property in Poland after his mother, a Jew, fled the Nazis.

Mr. Khochinsky’s land claim is not based on the most detailed of document trails. He has only an address in Przemysl, a city in southeastern Poland, from his mother’s birth certificate. But it is, nonetheless, the stance he is taking, even as Poland ramps up its efforts to have him extradited to face criminal charges related to the acquisition of stolen goods.

Last month, during a visit to Paris he was detained by the police, and is now currently barred by court order from leaving the European Union. For his part, Mr. Khochinsky has sued Poland in United States federal court, arguing that its efforts to retrieve the painting, which he says he inherited from his father, a former Soviet soldier, have damaged his business.

Resolving international disputes over looted art is never easy. But this one has become particularly complicated by the fact that Polish suffering and losses from the war remain a potent issue here. Anything that touches on the nation’s unfathomable suffering during the war, which saw six million Poles killed, of which three million were Jewish, sets off a wellspring of emotion. The current right-wing government has tapped into those feelings and intensified in recent years its efforts to track plundered treasures and rebuild the nation’s historical heritage. The official list of “looted art” still includes some 63,000 objects.

Mr. Khochinsky, on the other hand, has raised the specter of anti-Semitism in the Polish government’s pursuit of him, and in its refusal to negotiate compensation for what he describes as the confiscation of his mother’s home. On the site now stands a Catholic Church.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The persistent and liberating message in Nari Ward’s sculpture and room-size installations is that art can be made from virtually anything. In his midcareer retrospective at the New Museum, “We the People,” this means old carpets, plastic bags, bottles, zippers, bed springs, keys and furniture. Hundreds of fold-up baby strollers take up a gallery in “Amazing Grace” (1993), while a canopy of yarn, rope and other found materials are used to create “Hunger Cradle” (1996). “We the People” (2011), nodding to the preamble of the United States Constitution, has that title spelled out in colored shoelaces embedded in a wall.

Using found materials to make art is a radical, if decades-old, tactic. In the late 1950s, the artist Allan Kaprow predicted that artists would use everyday objects, including chairs, food, electric and neon lights, old socks and billboards. Many of these items appear in Mr. Ward’s show . And although Mr. Ward came up through the art system — he was a fellow at the American Academy in Rome and shows regularly in New York galleries and global biennials — his work also resembles folk art and relates to specific locations, documents and histories.

“We the People” reminds you of street memorials with shoes thrown over tree branches or telephone wires. But who is the “we” in this work? It might apply to everyone covered under the Constitution, since these words come from its preamble — except that we know, historically, that the Constitution hasn’t been applied similarly or equally to people of the African diaspora, like Mr. Ward, who was born in Jamaica and moved to the United States when he was 12.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>After two deadly crashes involving the same jet model, Boeing will make standard a feature that it had charged for, as part of an effort to get the planes in the air again. Neither of the planes that crashed in Ethiopia and Indonesia was equipped with the feature, which is not required by regulators.

Yesterday: The Defense Department said it was investigating complaints that the acting defense secretary, Patrick Shanahan, had been promoting his former employer, Boeing, and disparaging its military contractor competitors.

Go deeper: Investigators in Indonesia described confusion and prayer in the cockpit before the Lion Air crash in October. “God is great,” the co-pilot prayed.

Saying on Wednesday that the U.S. economy was slowing more than it had previously thought, the central bank left interest rates unchanged and signaled little appetite for raising them in the near future.

The Fed said that growth appeared to be slowing under the weight of the trade war, economic slowdowns in Europe and China, and fading stimulus from the tax cuts of 2017.

What’s next: The central bank expects 2.1 percent growth this year, down from the 2.3 percent it forecast in December — and more than a percentage point less than the 3.2 percent growth predicted by the White House. In 2020, the Fed projects growth of 1.9 percent.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>A three-judge panel from a federal appeals court in Manhattan heard arguments on Tuesday in a case that might sound like little more than an odd souvenir of these strange times, but that in fact raises a novel First Amendment question.

At issue is whether President Trump can block people from seeing the messages he posts on his personal Twitter account, @realDonaldTrump — something he has done a fair number of times, while also using the platform to conduct presidential business, like dismissing his secretary of state and barring transgender troops from serving in the military.

A few months into his presidency, Mr. Trump and his social media director, Dan Scavino, were sued by seven plaintiffs — all active Twitter users and ardent critics of the president — who had been blocked from seeing the president’s Twitter posts. That meant they also couldn’t reply or see other people’s responses to his tweets.

“Because of the way the president and his aides use the @realDonaldTrump Twitter account,” the plaintiffs in Knight Institute v. Trump said in their complaint, “the account is a public forum under the First Amendment.” They asked a federal judge to declare the blocking a form of “viewpoint-based exclusion” and to order that their access be restored.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>What began as one student’s vigil calling for action on climate change has gone global, with school strikes planned in more than 100 countries on Friday. Here is a look at how the climate protests spread and how political leaders are responding.

[See pictures from the youth strikes around the world.]

When a Swedish teenager, Greta Thunberg, sat before her country’s Parliament in August, she was a solitary protester, armed with fliers that said she was refusing to attend school to protest adults’ lack of concern for her future.

She sought to draw attention to the perilous state of the climate: Data from NASA has shown the past five years to be the warmest on record, and a report last year by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that without aggressive action, the world will face worsening wildfires, food shortages and other catastrophic effects as early as 2040.

Ms. Thunberg’s protest quickly drew notice, with others joining in. After the Swedish elections in September, she made her strike a weekly event most Fridays. Then it began to spread, both online under the hashtags #climatestrike and #FridaysForFuture and on the streets.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I will die before I buy another car.

I don’t say that because I am particularly old or sick, but because I am at the front end of one of the next major secular trends in tech. Owning a car will soon be like owning a horse — a quaint hobby, an interesting rarity and a cool thing to take out for a spin on the weekend.

Before you object, let me be clear: I will drive in cars until I die. But the concept of actually purchasing, maintaining, insuring and garaging an automobile in the next few decades?

[Kara Swisher answered your questions about this column on Twitter.]

This could be the most important shift since the Cambrian explosion of the smartphone. Car-sharing continues to increase (Uber and Lyft are set to go public this year), new innovations emerge all the time (Scooters! Vertical-take-off-and-landing vehicles!) and all manner of autonomous technologies are inevitable (Elon Musk, whatever you think of him or the prospects of Tesla, is 100 percent directionally correct). Private car ownership declined globally last year, and it is a trend that I believe is going to accelerate faster than people think.

Not everyone agrees. After an initial rush of hype and hope, there was a backlash against the idea that autonomous and shared cars would soon take over.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>BERLIN — From a silver fireplace screen to a jacket spun with golden thread, artifacts from the state apartments of Dresden’s Royal Palace represent the dynasty of August the Strong in full splendor. The property was destroyed during the Allied bombing of February 1945 that reduced much of the Saxon city’s center to rubble, but will rematerialize this September in the palace’s west wing.

The opening, three centuries after the apartments’ inauguration to celebrate the marriage of the Electoral Prince Friedrich August and the Archduchess Maria Josepha, follows a $38 million reconstruction involving handmade tapestries and ceiling paintings.

Also soon to open is the Semper Gallery, after a $57 million renovation. The 19th-century building adjacent to the palace, which was also damaged in World War II, will be home to a permanent exhibition juxtaposing its old masters collection with a variety of sculpture.

As a preview of the new additions to Dresden’s museum landscape, a selection of 23 paintings, swords, porcelain vases and more will be on display at Tefaf, the fine art fair in Maastricht, the Netherlands, this month. The exhibit is a tribute to both imperial might and the craftsmanship of a bygone age.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>One night recently I got an unexpected glimpse of how my children see me. I noticed new pictures on my phone, and vaguely recalled that one of my 5-year-old twins had been playing with my phone while I was working on a local news article and attempting to feed the baby.

I had been deep into fact-checking federal housing guidelines and scouring pages of city zoning code, trying to meet a deadline that I had already pushed back twice. I had also been deep into my feelings of guilt as I once again tried to placate my four children with electronics so that I could work. As I once again fed them frozen foods, heated on a cookie sheet for dinner rather than a nutritious meal.

The scene my son captured shows me balancing a bottle with one hand and a laptop with the other, instead of looking my baby in the eyes and bonding through her feeding.

What made him pause his constant movement and silliness to freeze-frame that moment of our life?

“I liked that you were working at home instead of having to go to the coffee shop for some peace and quiet,” he said. “So that meant I was being good! I like when you are here. I don’t like when you leave me.” I felt the guilt knock the wind out of me. My child thought my leaving to work was a consequence of his behavior. He thought that I left when my kids didn’t meet my expectations. What a lot of weight for a small child to carry. I vowed to rephrase the way I spoke about going to work. More about me, less about them.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>But with time before the Senate has to vote, Mr. Trump and his allies have an opportunity to lobby Mr. Paul. Such tactics have been successful before: The Senate Foreign Relations Committee was poised to give Mike Pompeo’s nomination as secretary of state an unfavorable recommendation until Mr. Paul bowed to pressure and gave his approval.

Mr. Trump, who was repeatedly denied wall funding by lawmakers, hopes to use $3.6 billion from military construction projects to fulfill his campaign promise to build a wall along the southern border. He has dismissed concerns about the precedent, saying in a speech on Saturday that “they’re going to do that anyway, folks.”

Some Republican senators — including Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee — have voiced concerns about the effect on military readiness, seeking assurances that projects in their states will not be affected. The Defense Department has yet to release a list of projects affected.

Others, including Mr. Paul, have objected to a possible overreach of executive power that future presidents could take advantage of. But few have been willing to publicly say how they will vote on the resolution.

Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, said it was “unnecessary and unwise to turn a border crisis into a constitutional crisis about the separation of powers” in a floor speech on Thursday, where he outlined other means for obtaining funds.

“There is no limit to the imagination of what the next left-wing president could do to harm our country with this precedent,” he added. But pressed by reporters, he declined to reveal his planned vote.

“I learned a long time ago in the United States Senate, it’s not wise to announce how you will vote on a vote you may never have to take,” he said.

Conversely, Ms. Collins joined Senator Tom Udall, Democrat of New Mexico, in introducing a resolution of disapproval on Thursday. Ms. Murkowski joined the pair in co-sponsoring the resolution.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The administration’s manufactured talking points fell apart. On Oct. 22, 2015, Master Sgt. Joshua Wheeler died fighting alongside Kurdish forces in northern Iraq. He would be the first of 14 American troops who were killed in combat during the campaign in Iraq, Syria and Jordan. On April 29, 2017, the Army’s First Lt. Weston Lee was killed on a routine patrol in Mosul when he stepped on a roadside bomb unearthed by construction equipment. And on Jan. 16, 2019, Chief Warrant Officer 2 Jonathan R. Farmer and Chief Cryptologic Technician Shannon M. Kent, respectively of the Army and the Navy, as well as a civilian Defense Department employee named Scott A. Wirtz and an interpreter named Ghadir Taher, were killed in a suicide-bomb blast in Manbij, Syria.

Everything in 2017 looked almost the same as it did in 2007, only with a smaller number of American troops deployed to Iraq (roughly 5,200) and Syria (around 2,000) and a greater reliance on Iraqi troops and Syrian fighters to do most of the killing and dying. Fight and die they did, by the thousands. Many more civilians died, and millions were displaced. In Syria, a conglomerate of Kurdish and Arab fighters called the Syrian Democratic Forces took back Islamic State territory one mile at a time, fighting doggedly into Raqqa, the extremist group’s capital. In Mosul, the Iraqi military pushed into a city fortified with booby traps, moats, snipers and dump trucks packed with explosives.

In May 2017, I met 19-year-old Pvt. Mohammed Ali al-Shwele. He drove a bulldozer for the Iraqi Army. Each day, as his comrades pushed deeper into Mosul, he would take his bulldozer and drive into the next Islamic State-held street. The only weapon he had was the vehicle’s front plow. “There can be no liberation without the bulldozer,” Shwele told me. In reality, there was no liberation without him and people like him. Less than a week later, his bulldozer was hit and destroyed by a rocket. The flames covered most of his body in third-degree burns.

With the expulsion of the extremist group from its self-proclaimed caliphate, it has aptly shifted back to its insurgent roots, attacking the same people who fled their once-besieged cities in Iraq and Syria. In Afghanistan, an Islamic State offshoot continues to grow, and in the Philippines, disenfranchised youth in the country’s south are turning to the Islamic State’s black flag in increasing numbers. This week, the main Islamic State branch finally claimed credit for the Oct. 4, 2017, ambush in Niger that left four American soldiers dead.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>CHICAGO — R. Kelly was released from jail on Saturday for the second time in less than two weeks after being taken into custody this week for failing to pay his ex-wife more than $160,000 in child support.

Mr. Kelly was charged last month with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse and spent a weekend in jail before a woman who described herself as a friend posted $100,000 bond.

It was not immediately clear who arranged for Mr. Kelly’s release on Saturday. His lawyer, Steven Greenberg, said the person who posted the $161,663 bond wished to remain anonymous.

“I promise you, we’re going to straighten all this stuff out,” Mr. Kelly said after he left the Cook County Jail in Chicago, according to television station WSB-TV.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>In the beginning, there is nothing. And in the end, there is — nothing, once again.

Such is the way of all flesh, no? And, since the subject here is the accumulation of money, let’s say the way of all cash, too. But in this case, out of nothing there emerges such a heaving ferment of aspiration, energy, tenacity and audacity that you’re left reeling by the scope and vitality of it all.

That, in essence, is what the magnificent play “The Lehman Trilogy,” at the Park Avenue Armory, both is about and, more important, simply is. This genuinely epic production out of London, directed with surging sweep and fine-tooled precision by Sam Mendes, charts the history of the financial institution that would come to be known as Lehman Brothers, from its humble origins to its epical implosion, over a span of three centuries and many generations.

The script by the Italian playwright Stefano Massini, exquisitely adapted into English by Ben Power, follows the blossoming of a small Alabama clothing store in the 1840s, founded by three immigrant Jewish brothers from Bavaria, into an international powerhouse of the stock exchange, before its world-rattling collapse in 2008.

What is wrought by those three original brothers and their descendants is impressive, for sure, as they redefine the nature of getting and spending in the United States, while accumulating unbounded personal wealth.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>As I watched “I Married an Angel,” the wan Encores! offering that opened on Wednesday night at New York City Center, my mind kept flashing to debates about Confederate monuments. What do we do with the troublesome products of our cultural past?

Encores! is in the business of monuments. The series’ implicit argument is that old musicals, even with faulty books or politics, may offer meaningful pleasures. Failing that, they may offer history lessons.

And it’s true, I was glad for both reasons to see “I Married an Angel,” a dance-heavy 1938 Rodgers and Hart fantasia unlikely to be revived on its own merits. Not only does it provide an opportunity to watch the New York City Ballet star Sara Mearns perform the choreography of her husband, Joshua Bergasse, and to hear a Richard Rodgers score suavely reincarnated, but it also makes you think about the role musical theater has often played in maintaining odious social norms even while advancing purely artistic ones.

Still, I’m not sure those excuses suffice anymore.

If the problem were just a few lines, it might be swept away or ignored. But even after a thorough feminist scouring by the playwrights Sarah Saltzberg and Sandy Rustin, “I Married an Angel” is solid-state groan-worthy. You can’t scour away Lorenz Hart’s lyrics.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Scammers and cheats are the paradigmatic figures of our age, and not just because a con man is president of the United States. Again and again in recent years, people who’ve scaled the cultural heights have been revealed as audacious frauds. The systems and institutions that confer status in our society keep being exposed as Ponzi schemes. Grift is turning into our central national narrative.

There are cons in every period — in the 2000s we had Enron, Bernie Madoff, and James Frey’s pseudo-memoir “A Million Little Pieces.” But there’s something distinct and era-defining about the current crop of high-profile scams. They hinge on the buying, selling and stealing of cultural capital, taking advantage of preconceived ideas of what success looks like. They’re made possible by the ephemerality of an economy where, to quote Ivanka Trump, heiress to a scamming dynasty, “If someone perceives something to be true, it is more important than if it is in fact true.”

Elizabeth Holmes, founder of the biotech start-up Theranos, raised hundreds of millions of dollars by styling herself as a beautiful distaff Steve Jobs, a Stanford dropout who promised to disrupt the medical field. She incarnated an unattainably ascetic Silicon Valley ideal; as The New York Times T magazine once described her, “She only pauses in her work to run — seven miles a day.”

Elites adored her — Bill Clinton interviewed her on stage at the Clinton Global Initiative in 2015, and Rupert Murdoch and Betsy DeVos invested in Theranos. But her company’s core technology didn’t work, and she’s now facing up to 20 years in prison on fraud and conspiracy charges. Her story is the subject of a best-selling book, a hit podcast and a feature film that’s set to star Jennifer Lawrence. A documentary directed by Alex Gibney premieres on HBO next week.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>A more affordable version with a range of about 230 miles and a starting price of $39,000 is supposed to go into production in spring 2021.

Tesla said it aimed to offer the Model Y in the United States, Canada, Mexico, China, Germany, the Netherlands and a number of other European countries.

Investors seemed unimpressed by the rollout. Tesla’s shares declined 5 percent on Friday.

Tesla is confronting sales challenges in Europe and China, markets it has been counting on for expansion. The company has also faced some operational uncertainty. Two weeks ago, Mr. Musk announced that Tesla would begin selling a long-awaited version of its Model 3 sedan priced at $35,000, $8,000 less than the cheapest current version. But he said Tesla would lose money in the first quarter, and analysts question whether Tesla can ever make money on the car at the lower price.

Tesla originally said customers would have to wait two to four weeks for delivery of the $35,000 Model 3. It now says the wait is six to eight weeks because of the volume of orders.

Sales of Tesla’s other models, the Model S luxury sedan and Model X sport utility vehicle, have been flattening. And analysts suspect that demand for Tesla vehicles has softened since the beginning of the year, when the federal tax credit available to Tesla customers fell by half, raising the total cost for buyers. Until the end of 2018, Tesla buyers were eligible for a credit of $7,500. That fell to $3,850 on Jan. 1, essentially raising the price of Tesla cars.

Tesla responded with a series of price cuts to lift sales. In a conference call in January, Mr. Musk said many customers could not afford the company’s cars.

To cut costs, Tesla announced that it would close most of its stores around the country. Days later, it backtracked and decided to keep many of the stores, and to reopen some that had already closed, though it affirmed a shift toward online-only sales. It also reversed direction on pricing, saying it would increase prices on all its cars except the $35,000 version of the Model 3.</TEXT>

The special counsel’s report has Washington spinning, and it hasn’t even been filed yet.
• In declaring that impeaching President Trump is “just not worth it” without waiting for the evidence from the special counsel, Speaker Nancy Pelosi may be setting a far-reaching precedent that will empower presidents for decades to come.
• The Trump administration’s annual budget proposal envisioned a series of cuts that contrasted with the president’s own words of support for both programs and people — including some groups that make up his political base.</TEXT>

ALBANY — New York State lawmakers have agreed to impose a statewide ban on most types of single-use plastic bags from retail sales, changing a way of life for millions of New Yorkers as legislators seek to curb an unsightly and omnipresent source of litter.

The plan, proposed a year ago by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, would be the second statewide ban, after California, which banned bags in 2016. Hawaii also effectively has a ban in place, since all the state’s counties bar such single-use bags.

New York’s ban, which would begin next March, would forbid stores to provide customers with single-use plastic bags, which are nonbiodegradable and have been blamed for everything from causing gruesome wildlife deaths to thwarting recycling efforts.

The ban, which is expected to be part of the state’s budget bills that are slated to be passed by Monday, would have a number of carveouts, including food takeout bags used by restaurants, bags used to wrap deli or meat counter products and bags for bulk items. Newspaper bags would also be exempted, as would garment bags and bags sold in bulk, such as trash or recycling bags.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>In the more than six years since his daughter Avielle was killed in the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Jeremy Richman had devoted his life to preventing families from experiencing the kind of tragic loss he did.

With his wife, Jennifer Hensel, he created the Avielle Foundation to support research into brain abnormalities that could be linked to violent behavior. In this endeavor, he stressed mental health education and compassion.

“Compassion is the ability to feel somebody else’s suffering, to empathize,” Mr. Richman, a neuroscientist, said in a video for the foundation. “But most importantly, it’s the hope that you can do something to alleviate that suffering.”

On Monday, Mr. Richman, 49, was found dead in an apparent suicide in the Newtown, Conn., building where the Avielle Foundation had an office, the local police said. His death was all the more shocking given the scope of his work, community members said.

“Our hearts are shattered, and our heads are struggling to comprehend,” the foundation said in a statement.

“Tragically, his death speaks to how insidious and formidable a challenge brain health can be and how critical it is for all of us to seek help for ourselves, our loved ones and anyone who we suspect may be in need,” it continued.

The police were called to Edmond Town Hall, a movie theater and event space that also rented offices and meeting rooms, at about 7 a.m. on Monday by contractors who were working there, said Lt. Aaron Bahamonde of the Newtown Police Department.

Upon arriving, the police also found a note left by Mr. Richman. Lieutenant Bahamonde did not disclose what it said.

The police and the state’s medical examiner’s office were investigating the death, he said.

Mr. Richman’s death came more than six years after a gunman stormed Sandy Hook Elementary School, killing Avielle, 6, and 25 other people, before turning the gun on himself. The massacre, on Dec. 14, 2012, thrust Newtown into the caustic national debates on gun control and mental health.

Some of the police officers who reported to Edmond Town Hall on Monday had responded to the school shooting, Lieutenant Bahamonde said.

[Newtown shows how mourning evolves and endures for years after mass violence.]

“It’s something that you never expect to see happen, but in the back of your mind you know that many of us are still suffering,” said Neil Heslin, whose son Jesse Lewis, 6, also died in the shooting. “He was a good friend, and it was an honor and a privilege to have known him. He did a wonderful job with the foundation, building his daughter’s legacy.

Mr. Heslin added: “I’m sure it will rip open a lot in Newtown again. The town hall will be another tragic place here, like the school.”

After the Sandy Hook shooting, Mr. Richman expressed grief over his daughter’s death through verse, friends said. On Fridays, the day of the week that the shooting occurred, Mr. Richman posted haiku on his Facebook page. Some of the poems were haunting, including one on Dec. 5, 2015, titled “Anniversary,” which he posted beside a photograph of himself and his wife on a visit to Avielle’s grave:

But Mr. Richman also channeled his grief into action, leaving his job at a pharmaceutical company to focus full time on the foundation. He began hosting discussions and speaking at academic events about brain health and violence.

Last week, he was the keynote speaker at a summit at Florida Atlantic University, where he talked about research that was geared toward helping people identify the symptoms of those in crisis and support those at risk of harming themselves or others.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Some tracks on “When I Get Home” are named after Houston streets, and Solange’s lyrics (as they were in “Scales” on “A Seat at the Table”) are dotted with references to the city’s idiosyncratic status symbols like grills (extravagantly jeweled dental caps) and “slab” (slow, low and bangin’) cars with reflective “candy paint.”

Solange — echoing the artistic playbook of her sister, Beyoncé — paired the release of “When I Get Home” with an online film, which she directed and unveiled as an Apple Music exclusive. It’s a slightly abridged version of the entire album, accompanying non-narrative scenes of, among other things, black cowboys doing rodeo feats, a circular white arena holding group rituals in the desert, and dancers claiming Houston’s urban spaces. At the beginning and end of the film, Solange, in a glittering dress, dances alongside a mysteriously hooded Holy Ghost, revealed at the end as a black man. “The film is an exploration of origin, asking the question how much of ourselves do we bring with us versus leave behind in our evolution,” Solange said in a statement.

The film visualizes “Sound of Rain” as a computer-animated extravaganza: a stadium full of dancers that turns into a garden, a burning man, people riding flying machines. The song is one of the album’s closest approaches to pop-R&amp;B, with an ingenious beat, terse melodies and abundant countermelodies; the lyrics are cryptic and sunken into the mix, but at the end Solange reveals, “Sound of rain/helps me let go of the pain.” Another near-pop song is “Jerrod,” a promise of intimacy — “Give you all the depths of my wanting” — that Solange coos with the airy tenacity of Janet Jackson.

For much of the album, Solange dissolves verse-chorus-verse into meditations and vamps. Keyboards supply rich chords that offer plenty of places to alight harmoniously; the beat is often an implied pulse that can and does leave behind 4/4 convention. In the chromatic haze, Solange ponders questions and considers life lessons in a few ambiguous words.

In “Beltway,” she sings “don’t, don’t, don’t,” pauses, and continues, “you love me”; it’s impossible to tell where the couple stand. In “Dreams,” she recalls growing up with dreams and advises patience: “Dreams, they come a long way — not today.” She teeters on the verge of a relationship in “Time (is)” — “I was getting to feel/All the way” Solange sings — before its six-beat meter changes to five beats and Solange and Sampha each repeatedly sing an enigmatic line: “You’ve got to know.” And with hovering piano chords and hissing cymbal, “Down With the Clique” hints at the anticipation of Herbie Hancock’s “Maiden Voyage” as Solange reminisces, “We were rollin’ up the street/Chasing the divine.”

In the interlude “Can I Hold the Mic,” Solange explains, rhapsodically: “I can’t be a singular expression of myself. There’s too many parts, too many spaces, too many manifestations, too many lines, too many curves, too many troubles, too many journeys, too many mountains, too many rivers, so many …” A keyboard follows each syllable of that speech, soon joined by chords to harmonize. The lilt of her voice alone could have carried these few seconds of content, but she and her musicians made the effort to match the rhythm and find its song. Because Houston is not her only home on this album; music is.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>52D: A terrific pun clue, “Not go overboard,” for riding the waves without a prop, like someone who BODYSURFS. I liked the visuals of this entry and its neighbor to the right, WIND FARMS.

95D: I imagine this is a true stumper for a lot of us, although I had my eureka moment a while after I’d figured it out on the crosses. It’s also a surprising debut — “Tupac” has been in the puzzle many times but never by his full name or surname. Tupac SHAKUR, despite having been killed at the age of 25, had created so much content that his estate has indeed provided material for seven albums, so far, since his death.

Ms. Maymudes and Mr. Chen have mixed up our library today, swapping the dust jackets on biographies and other books, creating appropriate but quirky new titles for notable life stories. There are eight biographical subjects referred to in the clues, five across and three down, including the momentous (Willie Mays, Archimedes), the mysterious (Amelia Earhart) and the marble (Venus de Milo).

Let’s take Venus at 92A as a first example. Arguably one of the most famous sculptures in the world, on permanent display at the Louvre and instantly recognizable by what she doesn’t have, this tall Classical figure was originally discovered in 1820 on the Greek isle of Melos, in several pieces. Supposedly, her upper limbs were either never found, or deemed later fakes and left on the island when she was taken to France. So she bid adieu to more than her home — she embodies the spirit of Ernest Hemingway’s title, at least: A FAREWELL TO ARMS.

O.K., let’s do a character out of fiction: Ebenezer Scrooge from “A Christmas Carol” at 23A. Not a nice guy and the last mean old skinflint we’d associate with a destructive-but-lovable Labrador retriever. Lo and behold, though, the ghost behind the triple haunting of Scrooge that turns him, er, a bit more lovable is Scrooge’s business partner Jacob Marley. So perhaps it’d be more of an autobiography, if you follow me, but the answer here, vis a vis Scrooge, is MARLEY AND ME, the 2005 best-seller by John Grogan about a dog (who was named after Bob and not Jacob, unsurprisingly).</TEXT>

      <TEXT>With singing like that, I hope you’ll agree that late was better than never this week. Enjoy your weekend! ZACHARY WOOLFE

On Wednesday at Zankel Hall, the vocal ensemble Theatre of Voices and its director, Paul Hillier, presented small sets of music by Arvo Pärt and David Lang. But the impact of their tour through Pärt — an assemblage of works composed in different decades — was drained of some pleasure by a video piece projected alongside it. The sedate shots of animals and skyscapes brought Mr. Pärt’s profundity (as well as the group’s singing) down to earth.

The premiere of the full version of Mr. Lang’s “the writings” helped illustrate how little help musicianship of this caliber actually requires. Presented simply, without multimedia interference, Mr. Lang’s work brought the Theatre’s singers together with members of Yale Voxtet.

They made a strong case for Mr. Lang’s latest cycle, which draws inspiration from the Hebrew Bible. The text of the third movement, “for love is strong,” is a long list poem of similes revolving around rooted, droning tones. And in a later movement, one could hear a chattering central vocal part that seemed influenced by Meredith Monk. But the harmonies — quickly shifting, comforting and peculiar at once — served as reminders of Mr. Lang’s individual artistry. SETH COLTER WALLS</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Four months after it last topped the Billboard album chart, Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper’s soundtrack to “A Star Is Born” has returned to No. 1 for a fourth time, thanks to the Academy Awards — and some deep-discount pricing on Amazon.

“A Star Is Born” was up for eight Oscars on Feb. 24, including best picture, and best actor and actress for Cooper and Lady Gaga. It took home one, best original song, for “Shallow” — which Cooper and Lady Gaga performed on the show, sitting cheek to cheek at the piano.

That publicity certainly helped the soundtrack reach No. 1. But so did an Amazon promotion offering downloads of the album at $3.99, which Lady Gaga made sure her 78 million Twitter followers knew about. (A further discount, to $2.99, was moot as far as the chart was concerned; according to Billboard’s rules, only sales made at $3.49 or more count toward an album’s chart position.)

“A Star Is Born” ended last week with the equivalent of 128,000 sales in the United States — up about 150 percent from the week before — which included 76,000 copies sold as a full album and nearly 41 million streams, according to Nielsen.</TEXT>

Normally this newsletter would be concerned with events in the wider world. But right now I just have to write about the shocking death — reportedly by suicide — of my former Princeton colleague, the economist Alan Krueger, at the age of 58.

I thought I knew Alan reasonably well and never saw a hint that something like this might be coming. But people’s lives often feel very different from the inside than they look on the outside.

What I can talk about is Alan’s work and why it mattered so much to other economists, myself very much included. For his research arguably did more to change how we view the economy than that of any other modern economist.

Alan’s most influential, paradigm-shifting work was his 1992 study with David Card on the effects of minimum-wage increases.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>In the salad days of his art collecting, back in the 1960s, the magazine publisher S.I. Newhouse Jr. started out modestly, at one point paying the dealer Betty Parsons on an installment plan.

His purchasing ramped up quickly from there, and Mr. Newhouse, the Condé Nast owner who died in 2017 at 89, eventually used his billions to amass a large collection of blue-chip modern and contemporary art.

“He had the best eye and the best collection of postwar paintings ever put together,” said his friend David Geffen, the entertainment mogul, who added, “I bought a lot of it.”

The fact that Mr. Newhouse was willing to part with well-known works by the likes of Jasper Johns and Willem de Kooning for the right price illustrates the fact that the collector, known as Si, was never overly sentimental about his trove. He was always happy to trade up or cash out.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Its stock price dropped a little more than four percent on the F.D.A. news.

Last September, the Securities and Exchange Commission accused its former chief executive, Hani Zeini, of concealing damaging information about the manufacturer of its implants before closing a $60 million stock offering in 2015. The Brazilian manufacturer had had a certificate of compliance required for selling in the European Union suspended. Sientra said its issue with the S.E.C. had been resolved.

The other letter went to Mentor Worldwide, owned by Johnson &amp; Johnson and based in Irvine, Calif. The F.D.A. said the company had not enrolled enough patients in a study of its MemoryShape implant, approved in 2013, and also threatened to rescind approval for the product. Withdrawing approval for a medical device is time-consuming and rarely occurs.

Mindy Tinsley, a spokeswoman for Mentor, said the company was disappointed by the F.D.A.'s decision to issue a warning letter &quot;despite our good faith efforts to address post-approval study requirements.&quot; She said Mentor notified the FDA last year that it would fall short of study enrollment targets because of changes in consumer preferences, but did not hear back. J&amp;J’s stock remained unaffected on Tuesday.

According to the F.D.A., the other two manufacturers whose breast implants are approved in the United States are Allergan and Ideal Implant, which did not receive warning letters on Tuesday. But their implants have also drawn some illness-related complaints from women.

Plastic surgeons and implant manufacturers often say breast implants are the most intensely studied of all medical devices. But critics and patient advocates say most studies done to date are flawed.

“When plastic surgeons tell women that ‘this is the most studied medical device in the world,’ women assume that means they are proven safe,” said Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Center for Health Research in Washington, D.C., who has been advising advocates for patients with implant-related illness. But, “we still don’t know what percentage of women become seriously ill from their breast implants. We still don’t know why some women get sick right away, some get sick years later and some never get sick.”

Dr. Zuckerman, trained in psychology and epidemiology, will speak at the F.D.A. meeting next week. She wrote a 40-page analysis of breast implant studies, and found that most had not tracked long-term outcomes, or had lost too many participants. In addition, she said, the studies focused only on diseases with specific diagnoses, while ignoring symptoms like joint pain and chronic fatigue. And they were generally too small to detect rare diseases, and were funded by implant manufacturers or plastic surgery associations that had a stake in the outcomes.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>LOS ANGELES — The great mystery of who stole the Willem de Kooning painting “Woman-Ochre” by cutting the canvas out of its frame at the University of Arizona Museum of Art in 1985 has still not been solved.

But the issue of where the painting has been — and why it’s been out of public view since its 2017 discovery by a New Mexico antiques dealer, has become clearer. It turns out that the work, said to be worth at least $100 million, has been in museum storage for months, awaiting approval from the F.B.I. to send it for restoration.

“The F.B.I. has kept this an open case,” Olivia Miller, the Arizona museum’s curator of exhibitions, explained. “The painting has been at the museum but it was still considered evidence, so it wasn’t allowed to leave until this past November.”

Now, the museum, in Tucson, is staging a coming-out-of-storage cocktail party on Sunday, with the first public viewing of the painting since 1985, before sending it to the Getty Center in Los Angeles in April for conservation. The Getty plans to exhibit the painting during the summer of 2020, after treatment, before returning it to the Arizona institution.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WELLINGTON, New Zealand — They arrived in New Zealand from across the Middle East and Asia, forming a tightly bound community of Muslims whose roots stretch to the mid-19th century. In recent years, migrants came to attend universities, open restaurants or to escape wars in Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq.

It felt as if everyone knew everyone. Mosques were not for Pakistanis or Somalis or Bangladeshis, but for anyone in town.

So when a gunman stormed two mosques in the city of Christchurch during Friday Prayer, killing 49 people, the news moved quickly through New Zealand’s nearly 50,000 Muslims and the wider Islamic world.

Throughout the Middle East, Asia and Oceania, families frantically sought visas so they could race to the bed sides of the injured. And they tried to get someone in New Zealand to answer their calls.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]

It was a novel defense for two men federal prosecutors had accused of being in control of one of New York’s oldest crime families: they claimed the Mafia had long ago been dismantled and they were being unfairly profiled as gangsters because of their Italian ethnicity.

But the strategy seemed to work. On Wednesday, a jury in federal court in Manhattan acquitted the men, Joseph Cammarano Jr. and John Zancocchio, of racketeering and conspiracy to commit extortion charges, after a colorful two-week trial.

Prosecutors had presented evidence that Mr. Cammarano and Mr. Zancocchio were the boss and consigliere, respectively, of the infamous Bonanno crime family, one of the five families that once controlled organized crime in New York.

Gina Castellano, the lead prosecutor, had said in her opening statement that Mr. Cammarano, 59, of Long Island, and Mr. Zancocchio, 61, of Staten Island, had “worked together and with other members of the mob to commit crime after crime — extortion, loan-sharking, drug dealing, assault and fraud.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Motke Zeidel (Sean Hudock) is 11 when we first encounter him, in 1926. By then, we’ve already met his ghost (Mark Jacoby), an old man whose narration begins and ends the play. So we know from the start that Motke — based on a real person — made it out of the Holocaust alive.

He and Yudi Farber (Seamus Mulcahy), an orphan who becomes his not-quite-official brother, are the central characters in this crowded story, which traces a thriving Jewish community under increasing assault.

Motke grows up to be a lawyer, forbidden, because he is Jewish, from practicing law. Yudi becomes an engineer, who, during World War II, draws up plans for Nazi “extermination plants” with subtle, chronic flaws built in. Together, at play’s end, they will tunnel toward freedom — which may sound like a spoiler but isn’t.

Mr. Hudock and Mr. Mulcahy give thoughtful performances, and the rest of the cast is mostly fine as well. But the many characters and relationships are too shallowly written to allow us to care about them other than in the abstract. As “Vilna” unfolds over 18 years, its sheer sprawl dilutes it. The first time the man next to me nodded off, we were in 1931.

The cavernousness of the theater works against the storytelling, too, especially since Mr. Discher tends to use only small slices of the bi-level set (by Brittany Vasta) at a time. In the loud silence of the space, and the pitch darkness beyond the stage, the play feels isolated — each scene sealed off, divorced from the larger historical tragedy.</TEXT>

The story surrounding Robert Kraft’s sex solicitation trial just keeps getting more salacious. Late last week, The Miami Herald reported that Li Yang — the owner of the massage parlor where Kraft, the billionaire owner of the New England Patriots, is accused of paying for sexual acts — had partied with President Trump and even helped Chinese donors gain access to the president.

Stephen Colbert couldn’t pass up the opportunity to make a few lowbrow puns based on the reported crimes. (Actually, more than a few: By the end of the segment, he boasted of telling nine straight massage parlor jokes. )

“Kraft has pleaded not guilty, and Saturday we learned that he has assembled a legal dream team consisting of multiple high-profile Florida criminal defense attorneys. Multiple? How many people does he need to get him off?” — STEPHEN COLBERT</TEXT>

      <TEXT>English teachers have long employed mentor texts — pieces that can be studied and imitated as examples of great writing — in their writing lessons. In this Reader Idea, Emma Tsai, an English teacher at Episcopal High School in Houston, and a writer herself, tells us how she teaches with mentor sentences from The New York Times — bite-sized nuggets of excellent writing that her students learn to identify in real-world writing and then use in their own creative pieces.

We love the way she breaks down the sometimes overwhelming task of teaching writing into digestible bites. Students read an article of their choice, identify well-written sentences, and then imitate them in their own piece of writing. She says the results have been astonishing — especially for struggling writers. What makes this lesson work so well? It’s “the combination of seeing writing done well out there in the world, plus their writing and reading about something they already find interesting,” she says.

Best of all, these activities can be used by any teacher with any day’s Times.

Finding Mentor Sentences in The New York Times

As an English teacher who is also a writer, I never stop looking for ways for my students to learn writing in an authentic way. I believe writing can be taught and learned, through not only practice but really approaching the craft formulaically until it becomes more natural. Learning to write well means reading strong writing, studying its structure and form, and copying it stylistically until a writer finds his or her own voice.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>In 2018, when Mr. de Blasio proposed a plan that would discard the exam and overturn the law, known as the Hecht-Calandra Act, he called the paltry numbers of black and Hispanic students in the specialized high schools “a monumental injustice.”

“Can anyone look the parent of a Latino or black child in the eye and tell them their precious daughter or son has an equal chance to get into one of their city’s best high schools?” the mayor asked.

Opponents of the mayor’s plan have said it could water down the schools’ academics and that it discriminates against Asian students, who would lose about half their seats at specialized schools under his plan.

“We firmly oppose the amended bill that completely eliminates the test and substitutes unnamed subjective criteria,” said the leaders of the Stuyvesant and Brooklyn Technical High School alumni associations, in the wake of Mr. de Blasio’s proposal.

A half-century after Hecht-Calandra passed, Mr. de Blasio has tried to make the case for why state legislators should eliminate it. But that plan has scant political support in Albany or downstate.

But both supporters and critics of the mayor’s plan have pushed him to release a blueprint to integrate all of the city’s 1,800 schools, not just eight especially prominent ones.

In 1977, a Times reporter observed that, after a decade of advocacy and discussion, the prospect of school integration in New York was dimming.

“If the dream of racially integrated public schools is slipping away now in much of New York City, what will have become of it five years from now, or ten years? The outlook, at best, is uncertain and troubled.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Alexa Willard scored 17 points to help 11th-seeded Missouri State stun third-seeded Iowa State by 69-60 on Monday, becoming the only double-digit seed to reach this year’s Round of 16.

Abby Hipp had 11 points and Danielle Gitzen scored 10 for the Lady Bears (25-9), who will compete in a regional semifinal for the first time since the Jackie Stiles-led team in 2001. They will face either Stanford or Brigham Young in Chicago after becoming the ninth team in 10 years to reach the Round of 16 as a double-digit seed.

Iowa State (26-9) played much of the fourth quarter within a possession of the lead, only to let Missouri State answer time and time again. Sydney Manning extended the Lady Bears’ lead to 60-54 on a 3-pointer, her only field goal of the game, and Willard followed with a jumper.

Gitzen answered an empty Cyclones possession with two free throws, and Bridget Carleton threw the ball away at the 1:07 mark with Iowa State down by 65-58. The Cyclones then inexplicably failed to foul Missouri State, allowing the Lady Bears to burn nearly 30 seconds off the clock.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“If there was human trafficking, these men would face more than misdemeanors,” he said. “Our view is that the state attorney’s job is to uphold the law, and we think he should be scrutinizing how the search warrant was obtained and traffic stop was done, and explain to us why we’re wrong” to object.

Mr. Burck said he is still in discussions with the state attorney about his offer, but declined to be more specific. Mr. Kraft and the other men can continue negotiating with prosecutors, who may make a counteroffer. Mr. Kraft is scheduled to be arraigned on Thursday.

On Wednesday, lawyers for Mr. Kraft and 14 other men filed a motion with the court in Palm Beach County to keep private all the evidence obtained by the police in the case. This includes hidden camera video of Mr. Kraft and the men inside the massage parlor over several days in late January.

In their filing, the lawyers said the evidence should remain confidential. The lawyers suggested that they do not believe that sex trafficking took place at the massage parlor.

Mr. Burck said the state attorney has not agreed to keep the evidence private.

“We don’t know why they wouldn’t want to protect the evidence in the case,” he said. “The images on the video would clearly be of a private nature” and the only reason to make them public would be if “the goal is to embarrass the person on the video.”

Legal experts who handle prostitution cases in Florida said most defendants ultimately accept the prosecutor’s offer because the cost of fighting their cases are not worth the trouble.

But Mr. Kraft may be more concerned that essentially pleading guilty to soliciting prostitution will harm his reputation as an N.F.L. owner, businessman and philanthropist. Mr. Kraft might also be penalized by the N.F.L.’s commissioner, Roger Goodell, who has broad authority to issue fines and suspensions for anyone who damages the league’s brand. The penalties, if any, could be based on the outcome of Mr. Kraft’s legal case in Florida.</TEXT>

On Sunday her importance to the team was on full display when Washington hit the go-ahead 3-pointer late to send the Aggies to their second straight round of 16 with a 78-76 win over Marquette.

Washington, who is in her first season at Texas A&amp;M after beginning her career at a junior college, had 13 points and 6 assists to help the Aggies get past fifth-seeded Marquette.

Carter scored 30 points to help No. 4 Texas A&amp;M (26-7) advance to meet the winner of Monday night’s game between Michigan State and Notre Dame.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Edgy only in the sense that it is very, very square, Matt Williams’s “Actually, We’re ______” at the Cherry Lane Theater stakes out a quartet of millennials as they navigate fertility, fidelity and a nauseating smoothie: pea protein, chia seeds, hemp seeds, kale, active charcoal, alfalfa sprouts, local bee pollen and bone broth. I belong to an organic food co-op, and still I gagged.

A queasy comedy of adultery, the play begins as two 30ish couples — Rachel (Mairin Lee) and Nick (Ben Rappaport), Frank (Gabriel Sloyer) and Molly (Keren Lugo) — meet for kombucha and crudités. The chitchat turns to babies, to religion, to the environment. There are jokes about women buying shoes and Buddhists self-immolating and a long tirade about how no one should ever bring a child into a world flooring it toward catastrophe.

Turns out Rachel is pregnant. Whoops. And the baby might not be Nick’s. Whoops again. In seven should-be brisk scenes, punctuated by projections and titles, the characters fall out of love and into quips.

This is my first ride-along with Mr. Williams’s work. For all I know he’s a mensch and a half, but I would hesitate to call him a playwright. Under John Pasquin’s ba-dum-dum direction, this is a show, supertitles aside, that longs to be a sitcom. (Turns out Mr. Williams has had a long and distinguished career in sitcoms. So, yeah.) Its dialogue and form don’t seem built for live theater, and maybe its jokes — “Every time I go to a bris, I imagine the end result looks like a calamari ring” — would ring truer with a laugh track. Maybe not: “L.G.B.T.-Q.R.S.T.U.V.W.!”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The prosecutor’s statement came days after Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, met with Prince Mohammed in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, during a tour of the Middle East to try to build support for his unannounced plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. It is unclear whether Mr. Kushner raised Mr. Khashoggi’s killing or the rights activists’ case during the meeting.

Both cases have strained relations with many countries in the West, including with Canada, whose ambassador was expelled from the kingdom after Canada’s Foreign Ministry called for the activists’ release.

“Can we know the results of the investigation and the torture before the detained women are transferred to trial?” Walid al-Hathloul, whose sister Loujain al-Hathloul is among the detainees, wrote on Twitter. “If there was a confession, it was a confession under torture.”

Any formal legal action against the group would face questions and doubts abroad because of allegations that, after their arrests, the activists were held in private facilities and beaten, electrocuted, insulted and sexually harassed. The abuse of one detainee was so severe that she tried to kill herself, according to people briefed on her case who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.

In January, the sister of Ms. al-Hathloul, one of the most prominent of the detainees, wrote in an Op-Ed in The New York Times that during a family visit, her sister “was shaking uncontrollably, unable to hold her grip, to walk or sit normally.”

Her parents asked her about torture on a later visit and she said she had been “held in solitary confinement, beaten, waterboarded, given electric shocks, sexually harassed and threatened with rape and murder,” the sister, Alia al-Hathloul, wrote.

In an interview on Saturday, she said an investigator had recently forced her sister to sign a letter written in her name asking for a pardon from the king. She said it was unclear whether the government was really planning to try the activists or was seeking a way to end a case that has tarnished Prince Mohammed’s reputation as a reformer and advocate for women’s rights.

“They are unpredictable,” Ms. al-Hathloul said of kingdom officials.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>66A: Wow, a UV wave really is a “Tiny bit of sunlight, for short.”

68A: Hi, kids! You didn’t think you were going to get off scot-free after 29A, did you? Even if something was way before your time, this to-do between France and the young United States is part of American history, and the XYZ AFFAIR is something you should know about. You can familiarize (or re-familiarize) yourself with it on History.com.

61D: Today I learned about Vega, the fifth-brightest star in the night sky, and part of the constellation LYRA.

Mr. Larsen runs the English alphabet in his theme, but you’re going to have to count to find it.

See those bracketed number sequences in some of the clues? Those are your theme entries, and the bracketed sequences tell you that the letters of the alphabet that match those numbers (e.g., A =1, B = 2) run consecutively within the theme entry.

So how does this work? Let’s start by looking at 18A. The answer to the clue “Simple, simple, simple [1,2,3]” is EASY AS ABC, where ABC is the first three letters of the alphabet.

Let’s go a bit further. At 19A, the answer to the clue “Half of the rap duo Black Star [4,5,6]” is the singer and actor MOS DEF, where DEF is the fourth, fifth and sixth letters of the alphabet.

And so on. The sequence of letters won’t all be at the end like these two were, but I trust that you can find them. I have faith in you.

I first had the idea for this theme in the summer of 2017. At the time, I was very surprised by how well the theme answers worked, but I couldn’t put the grid together. By June of the next year, my program and my word list had improved to the point that I thought it was worth giving the theme another go. My goal was to have as few theme answers as possible. I settled on nine as the best I could do. Mathematically, the middle theme answer is forced to have an even number of theme letters (either MN or LMNO). Since I wanted the theme letters to be located symmetrically, the middle entry had to be of even length. Therefore, I made the puzzle 16 columns wide. This also allowed me to put two theme answers in the top three rows. Perhaps I could have used a regularly sized grid by going up to 10 theme answers (maybe by splitting FILM NOIR into ELM and NOT). However, I liked FILM NOIR too much to do that. After fiddling around for a bit, I finally found fill that I was satisfied with. I'm happy to be back in The New York Times, and I hope you enjoy this puzzle.

Almost finished solving but need a bit more help? We’ve got you covered.

Warning: There be spoilers ahead, but subscribers can take a peek at the answer key.

Let’s talk about how we spend our days. Or, more specifically, how we schedule them.

It’s easy to think of our waking hours as blocks of time. Eight hours spent at work, broken up into smaller portions and scheduled out. Then we head off to live our personal lives, scheduling dinners, hobbies, happy hours, concerts and everything else. (Or, ahem, just rewatching a few hours of “The Office” on Netflix.) Rinse and repeat tomorrow.

It can start to feel like we’re just living in a routine, scheduled by however much time we think we can allot to a given activity.

But what if we’ve been looking at our days all wrong?

This week, Smarter Living is publishing a series of stories focused on how we spend our time — or, more precisely, how we spend our attention. So much of what we think about, like productivity, effectiveness or just getting things done, is focused on how we manage our time. But each day this week we’ll have a story that tries to reframe that mind-set and make you consider how you spend your attention, instead of just filling blocks on a calendar.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>A proliferation of digital spying tools in recent years has helped generate a surge in sophisticated espionage operations, once mostly the purview of major powers like the United States and Russia. Now, small countries, corporations and even simply wealthy people looking to settle scores can all hire private firms to conduct intelligence operations.

A New York Times investigation detailed this new era of digital warfare and the multibillion-dollar industry behind it. Two firms — NSO, an Israeli company, and DarkMatter, based in the United Arab Emirates — have hired former government hackers to help their government clients not only hack criminal elements like terrorist groups and drug cartels but in some cases to also act on darker impulses, targeting activists and journalists.

[Hackers for hire: How former American and Israeli government operatives conduct espionage on behalf of authoritarian governments]

Governments rely on surveillance as part of legitimate law enforcement investigations. NSO, selling technology created by graduates of Intelligence Unit 8200 — Israel’s equivalent of the National Security Agency — says it “helps government agencies prevent and investigate terrorism and crime to save thousands of lives around the globe.” Mexican officials have credited NSO technology as pivotal in helping to track and capture El Chapo, the drug lord convicted in New York last month. DarkMatter helps with internal security in the United Arab Emirates, former employees said, thwarting terrorism and helping the police solve crimes.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Of all the political issues that divide us, health care is the one with the greatest impact on ordinary Americans’ lives. If Democrats hadn’t managed to pass the Affordable Care Act, around 20 million fewer Americans would have health insurance than currently do. If Republican-controlled states hadn’t refused to expand Medicaid and generally done as little as possible to support the act, national progress might have tracked progress in, say, California – so another 7 or 8 million people might have coverage.

You obviously know where I stand on this political divide. But I’m starting to believe that I misjudged Republican motives.

You see, I thought their behavior was cynical and strategic: They opposed Obamacare because they thought there was political mileage in scaring people about change, and also in denying Obama any successes. Oh, and their donors really hated the taxes on the rich that pay for the ACA’s subsidies. And right up through 2016 they could hope to convince voters that they had a secret plan for something much better than Obamacare.

Indeed, all of these things surely played a role in GOP health care strategy. But at this point they’ve clearly lost the political argument. In 2017, Republican attempts to repeal Obamacare made it clear to everyone that their party didn’t have any better ideas, and never did; everything they proposed would have devastated the lives of millions.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The Southern Poverty Law Center said Thursday that it had fired its co-founder and chief trial lawyer, Morris Dees, after nearly a half-century, during which he helped build the organization into a fearsome powerhouse that focused on hate crimes and with an endowment that approached half a billion dollars.

The group’s president, Richard Cohen, did not give a specific reason for the dismissal of Mr. Dees, 82, on Wednesday. But Mr. Cohen said in a statement that as a civil-rights group, the S.P.L.C. was “committed to ensuring that the conduct of our staff reflects the mission of the organization and the values we hope to instill in the world.”

“When one of our own fails to meet those standards, no matter his or her role in the organization, we take it seriously and must take appropriate action,” Mr. Cohen said.

Mr. Cohen’s statement suggested that Mr. Dees’s firing was linked to workplace conduct. He said the center, which is based in Montgomery, Ala., had requested “a comprehensive assessment of our internal climate and workplace practices” in a bid to ensure that the organization was a place where “all voices are heard and all staff members are respected.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, has been offered a deal that includes paying a fine and doing community service in return for admitting that if his soliciting prostitution case were to go to trial, the prosecutors would win.

The prosecutors in Palm Beach County, Fla., offered the deal to Mr. Kraft and 24 other men who last month were arrested on misdemeanor charges of buying sex at the Orchids of Asia day spa in Jupiter, Fla.

The police and prosecutors say the massage parlor is the focus of a wider investigation into human sex trafficking in several counties in Florida. Mr. Kraft — who faces two misdemeanor counts — and the other 24 men have been charged only with soliciting prostitution; they have not been charged with any crimes in connection to sex trafficking.

News of the plea offer was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.

The investigation into sex trafficking is still continuing, said Mike Edmondson, a spokesman for the state attorney’s office in Palm Beach County.</TEXT>

      <TITLE>Massacre of Children in Peru Might Have Been a Sacrifice to Stop Bad Weather - The New York Times</TITLE>

      <TEXT>Some bodies had been buried in cloth, some wore cotton headdresses and others had red-cinnabar paint preserved on their skulls. Buried beside many of the victims were young llamas, each less than 18 months old. They too were sacrificed. The team noticed that the children were buried facing west to the coast while the llamas faced east to the Andes Mountains.

Using radiocarbon dating, the site was dated to about 1450 A.D., which placed it at a time before the neighboring Inca empire invaded. The team also attempted to collect DNA from the teeth of some victims but were only successful in a fraction of cases. What they got was enough to tell them that both boys and girls were present, meaning the sacrifice wasn’t gender specific. Further DNA analysis could help determine whether the children were local or if they came from across the Chimú state, but based on some morphological details the team thinks the victims came from around the empire.

A major clue to figuring out why the Chimú sacrificed the children came in the form of a thick mud layer preserved on top of the sand where the victims were buried. Because the area is a desert, the mud layer indicated there was once a period of heavy rain, like that seen during an El Niño, or a natural warming of the Pacific Ocean’s surface waters that has cascading effects on the weather. Such a deluge would have devastated the Chimú state, flooding crops, killing fish and sweeping people away.

Also in this mud layer, the scientists found preserved footsteps of sandaled adults and barefoot children, as well as signs that the llamas were dragged there. The children, it appeared, were marched to the site, which was just on the outskirts of the Chimú capital city, Chan Chan. The killings, the authors suggest, were done at the order of the Chimú state as an appeal to their gods or ancestral spirits to mitigate the rains.

“The picture that starts to emerge is that under conditions of severe climatic disruption, the sacrifice of children may have been the most powerful means of communication with the supernatural,” said Haagen Klaus, a bioarchaeologist from George Mason University in Virginia not involved in the study.

Tiffiny Tung, a bioarchaeologist at Vanderbilt University also not involved in the study, said that in addition to illuminating the Chimú’s rituals, the finding provides a look into the state’s political machinery. The sacrifice, she said, would have let the Chimú leaders demonstrate to their people the lengths to which they would go to appease the deities and protect the community. At the same time, carrying out such a massive slaughter of children would have been a reminder of the leaders’ power and authority over their citizens.

“That’s a great way to get people to step in line,” she said.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Amid the annual discussion of whether a dynasty is good or bad for women’s college basketball, Connecticut’s No. 2 seeding in the N.C.A.A. tournament qualifies as a sign of parity. With four No. 1 seeds — Baylor, Notre Dame, Louisville and Mississippi State — and three No. 2 seeds — UConn, Stanford and Oregon — that are strong contenders for the national title, the tournament appears to be more open than in the past.

When the brackets were announced, the Huskies’ seeding was considered shocking, which speaks to the ridiculously high standard to which the program is held. The last time the Huskies plummeted to such depths was in 2006. After all, this is a team that has advanced to the region semifinals in each of the last 24 seasons, making 19 Final Four appearances and winning 11 national titles.

[Read our live coverage of the men’s tournament here.]

In seven of the previous 10 years, there was at least one team that entered the tournament unbeaten and favored to make a dominant run. This season, every team in The Associated Press Top 25 poll has lost, and all but one of the top 10, Baylor, has lost multiple times, another sign of the game’s competitive growth.

“I mean, we did lose two games,” UConn Coach Geno Auriemma told reporters, sarcasm in full bloom. The losses came against the No. 1 seeds Baylor and Louisville, each on the road. “I’m surprised we’re a No. 2,” he continued. “I thought we’d be a four or five. We’re not in one of those conferences that perennially wins national championships. We can’t be expected to lose two games and not drop. I’m just happy they kept us a two and not a four.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“That’s great poetry,” Moondog says near the end of “The Beach Bum,” delivering a verdict on his own work. A bit later, after a literally explosive bacchanal during which bales of cash and a sailboat are set alight, he declares the evening “a blast,” inserting an expletive for emphasis.

Those two statements pretty much sum up what this movie, the latest from Harmony Korine, thinks of itself. Chronicling a hectic season in the life of its hero (a defiantly unkempt Matthew McConaughey), “The Beach Bum” is intoxicated by its own shaggy lyricism and committed to an ethic of unapologetic hedonism. Moondog is a genius. He will be the first to tell you so, but everyone else is quick to agree: his wife, Minnie (Isla Fisher); their daughter, Heather (Stefania LaVie Owen); Moondog’s agent (Jonah Hill, doing an accent somewhere between Truman Capote and Foghorn Leghorn); the judge (Jo Marie Payton) who sends the poet off to rehab.

Moondog quotes D.H. Lawrence and Charles Baudelaire from memory, so there’s nothing wrong with his taste. Twice he shares a verse of his own, a brief paean to his penis. He takes the stage at bars and parties in Key West and other parts of South Florida, reciting off-the-cuff odes that, if you were drunk enough, might put you in mind of Walt Whitman, Allen Ginsberg or maybe Henry Miller. Even with all the tequila in Margaritaville, I will never be that drunk.

Speaking of which, Jimmy Buffett is in this movie, playing himself. Snoop Dogg is in it, too, as Moondog’s drug-dealer best friend, Ray (short for Lingerie), and the high point comes when the two musicians collaborate on an impromptu ballad in Moondog’s honor. There is some other fun stuff, too — beautiful shots of the evening sky over Miami; good-time music that takes you back to the ’70s and ’80s; Zac Efron and Martin Lawrence in manic cameos — but nobody sitting in the theater or on the couch will experience as much pleasure as the people onscreen. Available evidence suggests that the movie was a total blast to make.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>In cleaner, more robust voice than many tenors a generation younger (even on their healthy days), he rose by the end to genuine nobility, passionate without strain. His love scene with Ms. Rachvelishvili was quietly combustible, an achievement considering they had no opportunity to rehearse together. (The Met said on Thursday that Mr. Kunde would take over Mr. Antonenko’s remaining three performances, too; as scheduled, Kristian Benedikt will sing Samson on March 28.)

For low voices, this revival benefits from playing alongside the rollout of Wagner’s “Ring” cycle at the Met. Tomasz Konieczny (an acclaimed Alberich) and Günther Groissböck (Fasolt and Hunding) moonlight memorably with small yet meaty parts in “Samson,” Mr. Konieczny as Abimélech and Mr. Groissböck as the Old Hebrew. Along with the conductor Mark Elder, Laurent Naouri is the holdover from opening night, and he still sings the High Priest with restrained relish.

Darko Tresnjak’s production has its garish charms; I like gold-tasseled costumes and shiny crowns as much as the next guy, and the massive god statue of the finale is impressive. But the staging feels static and antsy, rather than majestic or truly energetic. For all the nearly-nude gyrations of this Bacchanale, its intensity doesn’t build to boiling.

And if you’re going to go the old-Hollywood-spectacle route, as Mr. Tresnjak does, you can’t get away with the pitiful anticlimax of his finale, which dispatches the Temple of Dagon with a little bright light and smoke. After lurid lighting and miles of shiny fabric, I want to see a temple fall down!</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Spotify said on Tuesday that it had agreed to buy Parcast, a podcast producer known for crime and mystery series, as the streaming service continues its quest to become the biggest home of online audio.

The deal for Parcast, whose 18 shows include “Serial Killers” and the fictional series “Mind’s Eye,” comes several weeks after Spotify agreed to buy two other podcast companies: Gimlet Media, a podcast studio, and Anchor, a podcast tool maker.

All three acquisitions highlight Spotify’s main goal: offering not just music, but essentially any content that users would want to listen to. By snapping up podcast producers, the streaming service is hoping to stock up on high-profile titles in its rivalry with Apple, which has historically been the top podcasting platform.

Podcasts help Spotify in other ways as well. They are relatively cheap to produce, in that way improving the company’s profit margins, and help reduce the service’s reliance on expensive music licensing rights. And popular podcasts can attract a faithful audience of subscribers.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Joel Embiid had 39 points, 13 rebounds and 6 assists to lead the host Philadelphia 76ers to a 123-110 victory against the Nets on Thursday night.

J J Redick scored 18 points and Ben Simmons had 16 points and 8 assists for the 76ers, who snapped a two-game losing streak.

The game matched teams that would have met in the first round of the N.B.A. playoffs had the postseason begun before Thursday’s games. The 76ers have a strong hold on the No. 3 seed in the Eastern Conference with seven games remaining, and they moved three games ahead of idle Indiana.

Joe Harris scored 22 points and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson added 19 for the Nets, who fell to seventh place in the East, a half-game behind Detroit, which defeated Orlando. The Nets are a half-game in front of Miami, which beat Dallas, and only one ahead of the ninth-place Magic.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Well, he can’t change, because he’s dead. The music can’t change, because it’s already been made and we’ve thoroughly absorbed it. I think the thing that has to change is us. We can change. But I also wonder whether or not the thing that we should be taking away from this entire problem with respect to Michael Jackson and Wade Robson and James Safechuck is this concept of justice. There’s no satisfying outcome for this. This is a tragedy. And we have to accept it as a tragedy. And I don’t think the way we accept a tragedy is by covering our ears when you hear a Michael Jackson song. We’re past that now. I think what we have to do is figure out a way to live with a thing that we’ve been living with this entire time. We have to be able to hold space that incorporates the bad stuff with the great stuff. It’s the only way this is going to work, because this is not going to stop happening. And it’s obviously not just famous people, it’s everybody. It’s coaches, it’s priests, it’s politicians. It doesn’t work to just make people go away and not deal with the root problem of this behavior. And I think with Michael Jackson — I think that the reason the “what do we do now?” is so dissatisfying is because there’s nothing to do but listen and move through the world aware that this person did this. And it can’t be undone. These guys don’t get their childhoods back. There’s no jail to put this man in. There’s no place to send him. And the work is on us. And I think part of the reason that people want either an easy answer or don’t want to know anything is because we don’t want to do the work. It’s hard work.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Instagram users praised the post as appropriate for throwback Thursday, a social media tradition in which people post nostalgic pictures of their past with the hashtag #tbt.

Some expressed concern that the queen might face online abuse from trolls.

“I really hope she doesn’t use social media platforms anymore,” wrote one user. “She needs to be kept pure.”

This week, Buckingham Palace issued social media guidelines for its followers after users posted abusive comments directed at Meghan, the duchess of Sussex, and Catherine, the duchess of Cambridge.

The royal family has millions of followers across several social media accounts and platforms. The family’s communications staff spends hours each week moderating racist and sexist comments that tend to pit the duchesses against each other, a spokesperson for the Palace said.

“We ask that anyone engaging with our social media channels shows courtesy, kindness and respect for all other members of our social media communities,” the guidelines read.

“We reserve the right to determine, at our discretion, whether contributions to our social media channels breach our guidelines. We reserve the right to hide or delete comments made on our channels, as well as block users who do not follow these guidelines.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The letter poem, or epistle, is personal, addressed to a specific individual at a particular point in time. It is a conversation overheard. What could be more intimate than a daughter’s sharing with her mother the wonders of childbirth? Keetje Kuipers’s “Spring Letter from the South” follows the form faithfully, down to an unvoiced “wish you were here”; her beguiling account is like the letter you write in your head before you sit down and everything evaporates, as she gently urges us from the change in seasons toward a contemplation of the cycle of life. Selected by Rita Dove

Mother, it’s like summer here. I miss 

the way the mountains get cold at night,

draw their shoulders up. In the evenings

we walk through the old neighborhoods,

past the frayed houses where magnolias

collapse their heavy bosoms against

each roof’s pitched elbows. Everything

the baby does — proclaiming song-words

to the birds, commanding trees

to hold still or spill their guts —

is magic I haven’t given up on yet.

That pollen-rot smell is starting again:

one year later and it’s like a year

hasn’t passed. When she sleeps pressed against

me, we still feel so young — all of us.

Even the cemetery is beautiful

this time of year. Do you remember

when you were here? It’s like that.

      <TEXT>A world-renowned jazz singer. A public health champion. A teacher who helped desegregate New York’s public transit. And a lighthouse keeper who is credited with saving dozens of lives.

On Wednesday, the city announced that these four female historical figures would be honored with statues in New York. The announcement followed a monthslong process seeking to fix what New York’s first lady, Chirlane McCray, called a “glaring” gender imbalance in the city’s streets and parks.

Statues of the four women — Billie Holiday, Helen Rodríguez Trías, Elizabeth Jennings Graham and Katherine Walker — will be placed in the boroughs they once called home. Once the statues are installed, all five boroughs will have at least one public statue of a woman.

Only five female historical figures are depicted in statues in New York City in outdoor public spaces, according to She Built NYC, a city effort to expand representation of women in public art and monuments. All of those statues are in Manhattan, like the sculpture of Eleanor Roosevelt in Riverside Park and the bronze of Harriet Tubman in Harlem.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>For the first time since he was charged last month with two counts of soliciting prostitution in Jupiter, Fla., Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, commented publicly on the matter, apologizing in vague terms.

“I am truly sorry,” Kraft said in a statement released Saturday afternoon. “I know I have hurt and disappointed my family, my close friends, my co-workers, our fans and many others who rightfully hold me to a higher standard.”

Kraft continued by mentioning his wife of nearly 50 years, Myra Kraft, who died in 2011 of ovarian cancer. “Throughout my life, I have always tried to do the right thing,” he said. “The last thing I would ever want to do is disrespect another human being. I have extraordinary respect for women; my morals and my soul were shaped by the most wonderful woman, the love of my life, who I was blessed to have as my partner for 50 years.”

Kraft was charged with the two misdemeanor counts of soliciting prostitution last month, after the police said he twice visited the Orchids of Asia Day Spa and solicited sexual services. In the immediate aftermath, a spokesman for Kraft denied he had done anything illegal, and he has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Kraft has kept a low profile, but friends say he is tormented by what he has done.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Moreover, it is a myth that buybacks and dividends displace investments that companies would otherwise make to grow or develop innovations. While there was a substantial increase in buybacks and dividends last year, business investment also increased substantially and grew at the fastest rate since 2011. American companies invested nearly $3 trillion in the economy during 2018, including $460 billion in research and development. And the firms doing the largest buybacks are also the ones doing the most capital investment. Among large public companies, those that repurchased stock in the first three quarters of 2018 tended to engage in more capital expenditures and research and development investment than those electing not to do buybacks, according to our analysis of Securities and Exchange Commission filings of companies in the S &amp; P 500.

Not only do buybacks and dividends support a stronger and more dynamic economy, they also contribute to Americans’ retirement security. According to the Federal Reserve, the majority of American households have direct or indirect ownership of corporate stock through pensions, retirement accounts or investment accounts. Similarly, stocks are owned by thousands of pension funds and mutual funds, and millions of Americans benefit from asset price increases or when shares in those funds receive a dividend.

Of course buybacks, like other methods of raising and allocating capital, can be abused, as is the case when companies may attempt to artificially inflate their stock prices in the short term by buying back shares. To avoid such abuses, public companies should have strong corporate governance practices guiding how the decisions about stock buybacks and dividends are made, to ensure they are made with the long-term interests in mind.

By contrast, imposing federal limitations on how companies decide to use their capital would stifle innovation and opportunity in America. Recent proposals to restrict buybacks and dividends, while presumably made with the laudable intent of increasing wages and capital investment, will only make it more difficult to achieve sustained and inclusive economic growth in the United States.

      <TEXT>Never cross a Machiavellian mastermind. The prostitute-turned-madam-turned-spy Ros learned this the hard way, when Littlefinger gave her to Joffrey to use as target practice for his new crossbow. (It was payback for her thwarting his arrangements with Sansa.) Instead of the camera lingering on how Joffrey makes his first direct kill, it pans to Ros’s trussed-up, already dead body during Littlefinger’s now-famous “chaos is a ladder” speech. We pay our respects with actress Esmé Bianco. (Adapted from an interview for an earlier article.)

How did you find out about your character’s death?

I knew I was doing Season 3, but I thought it was strange that they hadn’t sent me any scripts. Then I got an email from the assistant of [showrunners] David Benioff and Dan Weiss, saying they wanted to conference call me. At that point, I was like, “Ah, that can’t be good news.” I knew I was living on borrowed time, and I was amazed that I had survived as long as I did, really. The call was like an awkward breakup. They were very timid about breaking the news, and eventually I had to be like, “Guys, why are you calling me?” They told me I was going to die, but they didn’t tell me how. They sent me the script the next day, and I was like, “Seriously? Why didn’t they just tell me on the phone that it was Joffrey who killed me?” I was so angry about that!

Getting killed by Joffrey was insulting because he’s such a little [expletive], excuse my French. He’s such a little twerp. Of all the characters to be killed by? And I was really infuriated that I didn’t get to die on screen. Nothing’s more fun than doing a great screen death! I begged them on set, “Can’t I have a final cough and sputter?” And they were like, “Nope, you’re dead.” “Please?” “Nope, you’re dead.”

Did you read any of the fan reaction? Did it help or hurt?

My character was kind of controversial because Ros doesn’t appear in the books, and a lot of the die-hard fans would time how many seconds I spent on screen per episode. They absolutely hated me in Season 1. So I stopped reading social media, because they upset me so much. People were seriously mean. I didn’t know people could be so horrible!

Did you check out social media after your death?

I had been sworn to secrecy, so I couldn’t tell anybody. But I tricked all my friends and invited them over: “It’s Cinco de Mayo, I’m having a party, and it’s also ‘Game of Thrones’ night, so we can watch that, too.” Almost like it’s an afterthought. I wanted all my friends around me for my death scene and the Twitter reactions. And it was absolutely insane. I couldn’t keep up with the tweets! I was surprised that there was such a huge reaction. I wasn’t one of the main characters, and it wasn’t one of the iconic deaths that people were expecting from the books. And people were reacting more than just, “Oh, she died,” or, “It looked gross.” People were really upset about it! That was really moving. So it worked! [Laughs] Maybe it’s because you don’t have that many characters in “Game of Thrones” who are just the average person on the streets.

Who had your favorite death and why?

I think Joffrey has to be one of them, because it was so satisfying. [Laughs] Obviously, I have my own personal reasons for enjoying watching Joffrey die. But seeing Catelyn Stark’s reaction during the Red Wedding, and the scream she lets out? I get goose bumps just thinking about it.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>OSLO — One evening in December, Marie Ulven was riding a tram through Oslo, remarking on just how unremarkable she hoped her music might someday be.

“We need queer art to make it normal,” she said. “We need protagonists who are just, like, living their best life and gay — that’s just part of their character.”

For the last couple of years, Ulven, 20, has made spiky, emotionally tactile indie-pop songs about the panting urgency of new love, and the sharp pain of when it’s unachievable, under the name girl in red. In short order, she’s emerged as one of the most astute and exciting singer-songwriters working in the world of guitar music, with a laserlike melodic instinct that verges on the primal and lyrics that capture the sweat of real life.

“Some people are just like ‘How did you dare to do this?’” Ulven said of the fact that she’s singing about women. “And it’s like, I’m just out here being a [expletive] normal human being, falling in love and writing a song about it, just like that other straight girl writing a song about love.”</TEXT>

      <TITLE>Should We Abolish the Death Penalty? - The New York Times</TITLE>

      <TEXT>In 2018, the United States executed 25 people and over 2,700 prisoners remain on “death row.” It is one of only 56 nations in the world that still practice capital punishment.

Last week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a moratorium on capital punishment in his state. Watch the one-minute video above announcing his decision.

Should the United States as a country stop using the death penalty? Is it ever justified, such as for the most heinous crimes? Or do you think it is always cruel and unusual punishment? Alternatively, do you think it should be suspended for practical reasons, such as because it is costly or sometimes unfairly administered?

In “California Death Penalty Suspended; 737 Inmates Get Stay of Execution,” Tim Arango writes:

LOS ANGELES — Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a moratorium on capital punishment on Wednesday, granting a temporary reprieve for the 737 inmates on the state’s death row, the largest in the Western Hemisphere. The move is highly symbolic because legal challenges have already stalled executions in California; the last one was in 2006. But death penalty opponents hope that because of California’s size and political importance, the governor’s action will give new urgency to efforts to end executions in other states as popular support for the death penalty wanes. Mr. Newsom, a longtime opponent of capital punishment, cited its high cost, racial disparities in its application and wrongful convictions, and questioned whether society has the right to take a life. “I know people think eye for eye, but if you rape, we don’t rape,” he said. “And I think if someone kills, we don’t kill. We’re better than that.” He continued, “I cannot sign off on executing hundreds and hundreds of human beings, knowing — knowing — that among them will be innocent human beings.”

Supporters of capital punishment said the move went against the will of the state’s residents. California voters have rejected an initiative to abolish the death penalty and in 2016, they narrowly approved Proposition 66 to help speed it up. “I think this would be a bold step and I think he’s got to be aware of the political downside,” said Michael D. Rushford, president of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, an organization in Sacramento that favors the death penalty and helped draft the ballot proposition, speaking before the governor’s announcement. “Voters have had multiple opportunities in California over three decades to abandon the death penalty and they’ve shut them down at every chance.”

After the news of Mr. Newsom’s decision broke, Mr. Trump said on Twitter: “Defying voters, the Governor of California will halt all death penalty executions of 737 stone cold killers. Friends and families of the always forgotten VICTIMS are not thrilled, and neither am I!” Speaking several hours later, Mr. Newsom said he had met with families of victims and they had expressed passionate but conflicting views on capital punishment. But the governor made it clear that his decision came down to his own conscience, prodded by impending decisions such as whether to support the state’s lethal injection protocol. An executive order Mr. Newsom signed on Wednesday does three things: grants reprieves to the inmates currently on death row — they will still be under a death sentence, but not at risk of execution; closes the execution chamber at San Quentin prison; and withdraws the state’s lethal injection protocol, the formally approved procedure for carrying out executions. “Three out of four nations in the world know better and are doing better,” Mr. Newsom said. “They’ve abolished the death penalty. It’s time California join those ranks.”

Opponents of the death penalty, including Mr. Newsom, have long argued that the practice is rife with racial disparities and is not justified by the high cost to state taxpayers. One study, in 2011, found that California pays $184 million a year to sustain capital punishment — or close to an accumulated $5 billion since the practice was reinstituted in 1978. In February, Mr. Newsom intervened in a high-profile death row case that for years activists have claimed was a prime example of racial injustice. Kevin Cooper, a black man who was convicted of four brutal murders by stabbing in 1983, has long maintained his innocence. His supporters have put forward evidence that he was framed by San Bernardino officers. Mr. Newsom ordered DNA testing in the case, something that state officials had refused to do in the past. The possibility of wrongful convictions — nationally, more than 150 people on death row have been exonerated since the mid-1970s, according to the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty — has also energized the opposition movement, around the country and in California. Last April in California, a man who had been on death row for 25 years for murdering a young girl, a former farmworker named Vicente Figueroa Benavides, was freed after a court determined that testimony given at his trial was false.

Students, read the entire article, then tell us:

— Do you support or oppose the use of the capital punishment? Should it be abolished in the United States?

— Do you think the death penalty serves a necessary purpose, like deterring crime, providing relief for victims’ families or imparting justice? Or is capital punishment “cruel and unusual punishment” and therefore prohibited by the Constitution?

— What is your reaction to Gov. Newsom’s moratorium announcement? Which of his arguments for a moratorium do you find most persuasive? Which are the least?

Do you think Mr. Newsom was right to issue a moratorium despite recent votes in support of the death penalty by California’s residents? Do you think it violates the will of the state’s residents, or should he follow his own conscience? Should public opinion matter in cases like capital punishment?

— How concerned should we be about wrongful convictions? Do you have concerns about the fair application of the death penalty, or about the possibility of the criminal justice system executing an innocent person? Do the recent cases of Kevin Cooper and Vicente Figueroa Benavides, cited in the article, affect your views?</TEXT>

      <TEXT>LONDON — Dutch prosecutors said on Thursday that they planned to bring terrorism charges against a man suspected of killing three people on a tram in the city of Utrecht, in addition to multiple counts of murder or manslaughter.

In a statement, the public prosecutor’s office in the Netherlands suggested that the mental health of the suspect, Gokmen Tanis, was also under investigation, as well as his motives.

“It’s being investigated if the suspect acted out of solely terrorist motive or that his actions came from personal problems in combination with radicalized ideology,” prosecutors said. “The Dutch Institute for Forensic Psychiatry and Psychology will be asked to conduct an investigation of the suspect’s personality.”

Mr. Tanis, 37, is scheduled to be arraigned on Friday in his first court appearance in connection with the shootings in Utrecht.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>If you didn’t scoop up a $200,000 Paul Newman-model Rolex Daytona a couple of decades ago, when they were selling for a tenth of that price, you missed your chance. You can read all about how wealthy people use watches to grow wealth here.

All is not lost, however. W e asked prominent dealers and experts to identify six up-and-coming vintage watches that are still reasonably priced — at least by high-end watch standards — and that stand a chance to outperform as investment assets.

Vintage Seiko diver’s models such as the 6105, the 6217 and the 6309 offer a tremendous bang-for-the-buck proposition, with prices from around $1,200 to $4,000. With classic no-nonsense tool-watch looks and tough-as-nails Japanese mechanical movements, these watches are high on style and value, as well as offering some rich history in a field dominated by their Swiss counterparts — which, of course, come with much higher price tags. The key in collecting here is to make sure you’re buying untouched, honest examples. The market is rife with refinished dials and aftermarket components. — James Lamdin, founder, Analog/Shift, New York

The Camaro had a distinctive cushion shape that seems like a perfect companion to the fashion of the late 1960s and 1970s. Designed and produced by Piquerez, a famed manufacturer of watch cases, it was introduced in 1967, and seems to be a clear predecessor of the celebrated Monaco, the famous square watch Steve McQueen wore in “Le Mans.” While other Heuer models such as the Autavia and Carrera have gotten serious attention from collectors, the Camaro remains a model that has quietly gained its own cult following. — Eric Wind, founder, Wind Vintage, West Palm Beach, Fla.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>ZORA AND LANGSTON 

A Story of Friendship and Betrayal 

By Yuval Taylor

Yuval Taylor’s “Zora and Langston: A Story of Friendship and Betrayal” is an overdue study of the famous yet underdiscussed friendship and literary collaboration between Zora Neale Hurston and Langston Hughes. “It is so easy to see how and why they would love each other,” the epigraph, taken from a 1989 essay by Alice Walker, reads. “Each was to the other an affirming example of what black people could be like: wild, crazy, creative, spontaneous, at ease with who they are, and funny. A lot of attention has been given to their breakup … but very little to the pleasure Zora and Langston must have felt in each other’s company.”

That final line encapsulates Taylor’s ambitious project. The dramatic fallout between Hurston and Hughes, triggered by their collaboration on the ill-fated and controversial play “Mule Bone,” has been fetishized in literary circles for its dramatic nature. Stories of their heated fights, rumors of a love triangle involving their typist, Louise Thompson, and the involvement of lawyers have all made the rounds. Consequently, the qualities that initially drew these artists together — their shared sense of mission and pride in ordinary black people — have long been overlooked. “Zora and Langston” refocuses our attention on the positive aspects of their relationship, while doing its best to explain — through historical records and firsthand research — what really brought their friendship to an end.

In July 1927, Hurston and Hughes embarked on a tour of the Deep South — part business, part pleasure — which began with a chance meeting in downtown Mobile, Ala., where the two ran into each other outside the train station. Hurston was there to interview Cudjo Lewis, the last living former slave born in Africa; Hughes was giving readings and performing his own research. Hughes, a Northerner, was out of his element, while the Alabama-born and Florida-bred Hurston was firmly in hers, traveling with a gun in her shoulder holster. On this trip, Hughes and Hurston grew conscious of their shared interest in black folklore and everyday people, and their pronounced taste for adventure. This chance encounter kicks off the book’s most exciting chapter, imbued with the “pleasure” Hurston and Hughes inspired in each other.

Soon after their meeting, the book describes the pair enjoying a meal of fried fish and watermelon. While most black people would have recoiled at such a meal because of its evocation of racial stereotypes, Hurston and Hughes reveled in defying such expectations. They visited Booker T. Washington’s Tuskegee University, where the only surviving photographs of Hughes and Hurston together were taken, the pair smiling on campus and looking impossibly young and carefree — a highlight of the book’s somewhat anemic visual offerings.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WASHINGTON — President Trump was forced to publicly acknowledge this past week what American intelligence officials said they had long been telling the White House: Even during eight months of blossoming diplomacy, Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, was steadily adding to his weapons arsenal and nuclear infrastructure.

Three times, Mr. Trump told reporters that he would be “very disappointed” if North Korea was preparing to launch a space rocket that intelligence officials believe could help Mr. Kim perfect the means to heave a nuclear warhead across the ocean. Satellite imagery taken Friday, and analyzed by the Beyond Parallel program of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, shows that the North has “continued preparations” on the launching pad at Sohae consistent with readying for “the delivery of a rocket.”

American officials said the reconstruction there began long before Mr. Trump left Washington in late February for a summit meeting with Mr. Kim in Hanoi, Vietnam, where talks abruptly ended.

The rebuilding at Sohae was not the only work underway.

While North Korea blew up the entrances to its major underground testing site at Punggye-ri in May, it never allowed in inspectors, as promised, to determine whether the facility had actually been destroyed. Commercial satellite photographs suggest the buildings containing the control rooms and computers used to trigger and study the explosions were carefully mothballed.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Let’s consider an example of a formulation. The diagnosis “major depressive disorder” may not tell you much about a person, but consider a formulation for an individual, which might go something like this: “Forty-six-year-old single mother of two presents with a three-month history of depressive symptoms including low mood, insomnia and poor appetite (with weight loss). Her condition was precipitated by psychosocial stressors, including unstable housing and credit-card debt since the breakdown of her marriage eight months ago. This is on a background of an introverted and passive temperament and a childhood in which her parents encouraged dependency, and this was followed by a marriage in which her husband had complete control of finances. There is a strong family history of depression; her mother and maternal grandfather were hospitalized for this condition. Protective factors include a strong network of friends and a willingness to engage with therapy.”

Obviously people who all have the same diagnosis of “major depressive disorder” can have different formulations. The combination of predisposing, precipitating, perpetuating and protective factors will be different for everyone. If a diagnosis is a stamp, a formulation is more like a fingerprint, unique to each individual.

In the hypothetical example above, treatment may not be limited to medication; it might include a suite of other interventions. Long-term psychotherapy to help build confidence and a sense of self-efficacy might be one element, as would other measures that on the face of it might not seem to be within the realm of psychiatric treatment. For example, it would make sense to provide assistance for obtaining safe and affordable housing if unstable living arrangements helped cause spiraling feelings of hopelessness. Similarly, helping the person find a course to learn budgeting skills or get a job might be beneficial.

If you have come to believe from what you have read that psychiatry is the study of the isolated and disembodied brain, you might be surprised to learn how important this component of the psychiatric process is and how long it has been around.

One of the early key proponents of this biopsychosocial model of mental illness was George L. Engel, an internist and psychiatrist who practiced in Rochester, N.Y., for most of his career, starting in the 1940s. Working with both physical and psychiatric illness, he was well placed to consider the relationship between the mind and the body, between emotions and disease.

He set out his ideas succinctly in 1977 in a landmark article in the journal Science. In this essay, Engel articulated why psychiatry should not be drawn too far into the medical model of disease, and why, in fact, medicine itself would do well to look beyond this model, which he suggested did not fully account for mental illness or physical illness, for schizophrenia or even diabetes.

The biopsychosocial formulation dovetails nicely with more recent developments in mental health, such as trauma-informed care, a model developed for patients who have suffered traumatic experiences such as abuse and assault. The goal is to avoid traumatizing them again in offering the very services meant to help them. Often this approach is summarized as moving from thinking, “What is wrong with you?” to considering, “What happened to you?” Like the formulation, a label is reframed as a story.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>This was also the most significant period for the peace process. Parties representing Palestinian citizens of Israel played an important role at a time when the government was negotiating Israel’s recognition of the Palestine Liberation Organization in return for Palestinian recognition of the existence of the State of Israel, signing the Oslo accords and exiting Gaza and Jericho.

These political and policy achievements are significant enough on their own, but Arab participation also contributed to and coincided with a culture very different from today’s. I remember the period of the Oslo Accords as a time of great hope, with a feeling of peace in the air. It brought us closer, Arabs and Jews, and made us all, for a brief moment, feel as though we belonged. We weren’t able to end the occupation and create full equality on our own. But for the first time, we were a political force that could not be ignored.

Since that time, Mr. Netanyahu and his allies on the right have understood that Palestinian citizens of Israel will be part of the solution, so they have chosen to make us the problem. In this election, like in the Rabin years, a center-left coalition cannot capture enough seats to form a government without Arab parties’ support.

No one understands this better than Mr. Netanyahu, which is why he is doing everything he can to make the case that a legitimate government cannot depend on Arabs. Indeed, one of his favorite talking points against his biggest challengers, Benny Gantz and Yair Lapid, is that their government will include parties that represent Arabs.

But instead of challenging this racist and fundamentally anti-democratic notion, center-left parties have reinforced it. Mr. Lapid has promised, “We won’t form a government with the Arab parties.” Even Avi Gabbay of the Labor Party, when he became party leader in 2017, declared definitively, “We will not share a government with the Joint List, period.”

This is politically foolish. But equally important, it misses the great opportunity to model the shared future we want for our children. If the center-left parties believe Palestinian citizens of Israel have a place in this country, they must accept that we have a place in its politics. We cannot build a shared future if we are relegated to the back seats of the Knesset chamber. Only a diverse and principled left-wing bloc will have the political power and moral might to create a real alternative in this country.

Ayman Odeh (@ayodeh) leads the Joint List, the third-largest bloc in Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, and is chairman of the Hadash Party.

      <TEXT>Villanova lost four critical members of its championship team to the N.B.A. draft after last season, but the inexperienced Wildcats managed not only to capture the Big East title but also their opening-round game Thursday, outlasting Saint Mary’s by 61-57 in the South Region. The No. 6 Wildcats endured the 11th-seeded Gaels’ slow pace, playing at a tempo Coach Jay Wright called “excruciating,” to win for the 14th time in 15 N.C.A.A. tournament games. Villanova anticipated a close game against St. Mary’s, and coming off the conference tournament, where the Wildcats won their final two games by a combined 6 points, they felt comfortable in those circumstances.

“St. Mary’s is one of the best in grinding out like that in close games,” said guard Phil Booth, who led Villanova with 20 points. “You saw what they did against Gonzaga in their conference tournament. So the Big East really helped us for that.”

Villanova will face Purdue, a 61-48 winner over Old Dominion, in the second round. Purdue’s win capped a 5-0 day for the Big Ten, which has three more teams playing on Friday.

Fletcher Magee led Wofford to the first N.C.A.A. tournament victory in school history.

A senior guard, Magee made seven 3-pointers and scored 24 points to lead the Terriers to an 84-68 victory Seton Hall in the Midwest Region. Wofford trailed by 54-53 with just over 10 minutes remaining but outscored the Pirates, 31-14, from there.

In the process, Magee became the most prolific 3-point shooter in Division I history, going past the mark of 504 set by Oakland’s Travis Bader in 2014. Magee has now connected on 509 shots beyond the arc.

Wofford (30-4) was 0-4 in the N.C.A.A. tournament before its win over the Pirates (20-14). Its reward is a date with second-seeded Kentucky on Saturday.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WELLINGTON, New Zealand — At least 49 people were killed at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, on Friday, in a horrific and methodical afternoon slaughter, part of which was broadcast live on the internet after the publication of a white supremacist manifesto online.

The massacre, which Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand’s prime minister, condemned as a terrorist attack and called “an extraordinary and unprecedented act of violence,” interrupted a day of prayer for a small immigrant community in the nation’s third-largest city and shook a country with little history of mass shooting.

Harrowing first-person footage, apparently from a camera worn by a gunman as he attacked the Al Noor Mosque in the center of the city, was streamed on Facebook — a grim milestone in the evolution of terrorism that raised questions about how tech companies can block extremists from using social media to spread hate and inspire violence.

Facebook said it quickly shut down the account, but a 17-minute video showing a man dressed in black shooting at fleeing worshipers and into piles of bodies with a semiautomatic rifle circulated widely online. In addition to those killed, at least 48 people were being treated for gunshot wounds, including young children, the authorities said.

The police said a man in his late 20s was arrested and charged with murder but declined to identify him. The police also said they seized several weapons and found two explosive devices on a vehicle.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Now there is another way in which ranked choice could be useful: Solving the Brexit mess.

Brexit is at a standstill because none of the options has the support of a majority of Parliament (or, it seems, of the British people). Yesterday, Parliament voted on eight different proposals under which Britain could leave the European Union. None got a majority. Prime Minister Theresa May has even offered to resign if Parliament passes her plan, knowing that would appeal to many members of Parliament. In previous votes, the May plan hasn’t come close to passing.

So some observers have begun calling for a ranked-choice solution. In effect, it would winnow down the options to the two most popular and then force Parliament to choose between them. “The great virtue of this voting system,” Partha Dasgupta, a Cambridge University economist, writes in The Financial Times, “is that it results in an outcome that is truly the majority winner.” Part of the idea, as Ian Dunt, the editor of politics.co.uk, has written, is “creating a process where tolerable compromises can be found.”

Notably, one of the only proposals that came closest to passing yesterday was a kind of meta option, calling for the British people to get an up-or-down vote on any plan Parliament ultimately passed. It’s a sign of how far Parliament remains from agreeing on the substance of Brexit.

I’ll confess to being torn about my hopes here. On the one hand, I think ranked-choice voting is a fair way for Parliament to find the most acceptable version of Brexit. On the other, I wouldn’t mind if Parliament were to find any acceptable version and then put the entire matter before the British public for a re-vote.

Related: On the latest episode of “The Argument” podcast, Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and I talk about how to replace the Electoral College, and one option is a national popular vote with ranked choice. We also debate the meaning of the Mueller investigation — and who should be feeling vindicated by it.</TEXT>

      <TITLE>Opinion | Stop Saying ‘Exponential.’ Sincerely, a Math Nerd. - The New York Times</TITLE>

      <TEXT>Take the humble quadratic (typified by the formula “x to the power 2,” or x²) which, for instance, tracks how the distance traveled by an object in free-fall increases with x, the time. Quadratic increases also “become more and more rapid,” but the exponential wins out — strikingly so — once enough time has elapsed. In fact, an exponential increase will eventually rocket past any fixed power of x.

These distinctions aren’t just academic subtleties — they have important real-world ramifications. For instance, at the start of the AIDS epidemic, it was found that the total number of cases in the United States was growing only cubically (that is, like x³), not exponentially as might be expected for a viral illness, a finding crucial for planning.

As another example, the practical running time of computer algorithms that slave away unseen for us (minimizing travel time, distance, cost, etc.) needs to grow far less than exponentially even if they are working on problems with an exponentially increasing number of possible solutions (for example, ever-growing possible combinations of routes and fares). An exponential rise in the time needed to calculate solutions would make programs running these algorithms so slow as to be essentially useless. You can earn $1 million from the Clay Mathematical Institute if you resolve the “P versus NP problem,” a key issue in which is whether a certain class of problems can always be solved in reasonable, non-exponential time.

There’s something more fundamental at stake here beyond such million-dollar distinctions. It’s true that English has a long history of borrowing specialized words for other purposes — for example, “catalyst” from chemistry being applied to people. But an essential characteristic of mathematics, one it arguably lives and dies by, is precision.

To be true to the subject, to aspire to the goal of living in a quantitatively literate society, the language we use to transmit mathematical ideas needs to preserve this precision. This isn’t just a matter of philosophy or aesthetics; lack of linguistic precision is what leads to commonly encountered phrases like “five times bigger,” which rarely means “six times as big” as it should, or “five times smaller,” which means — I’m honestly not sure what.

Everyday language, as early lexicographers most likely found, is an imperfect medium to transfer this precision. Learning the specialized vocabulary of math is one of the big challenges for schoolchildren. As those of us on the front lines will tell you, a word like “percent” can trip up even college students. Imprecise usage of math terms (such as “200 percent certain,” “divide by half,” “infinite” instead of “many,” “order of magnitude” more often than not ) just adds to the confusion.

Math is one of the few institutions we have left free of doublespeak or embellishment or biased opinion. Its words are supposed to mean exactly what they say. Let’s keep them that way.

      <TEXT>At East Austin College Prep in Texas, raccoons and rats invade offices and classrooms. When it rains, the roof of the main building leaks. Room 106 was so rickety a chair leg fell through the floor. Yet for all this, the secondary school pays almost $900,000 in annual rent.

It has little choice: Its landlord is also its founder, Southwest Key Programs, a charity that is the nation’s largest provider of shelters for migrant children. The nonprofit says it formed the charter school and three others to help disadvantaged students get to college, but Southwest Key has financially benefited from the schools. Not only does it collect rent, but it has forced them to hire its for-profit companies, which have charged high fees for everything from maintenance to school lunches.

“We don’t even have a cafeteria — we eat in our gym,” said Yamilet Perez, 18, the student council president at the Austin secondary school. “You’re sitting there eating your lunch, and you can still smell the sweat of the class before.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>When a Mississippi man who worked as a landscaper was arrested on trespassing charges last year, it was a low-level crime that would normally have been settled with a fine if he had been found guilty.

But the man, Harvey Hill, 36, never made it out alive from the Madison County Detention Center in Canton. His family believes that guards at the jail handcuffed him, sprayed him with pepper spray and beat him, causing his death, according to a civil lawsuit filed last week.

“We want answers and we want justice,” said Carlos E. Moore, one of the lawyers hired by Mr. Hill’s relatives, who are seeking unspecified damages in the suit filed Feb. 19 in a Mississippi district court. “No amount of money is going to bring him back.”

The Hill lawsuit names the defendants as Madison County, Sheriff Randall Tucker, a sergeant, a jail guard and unnamed jail employees. It says they either caused the abuse, failed to stop it or failed to provide proper care afterward.</TEXT>

There were contradictory accounts of how President Trump’s summit meeting with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, collapsed with no deal, their personal warmth yielding to hard disagreement.

After the talks were abruptly abandoned, Mr. Trump said he had rejected an offer from Mr. Kim to dismantle some of his nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of all sanctions. The North disputed this, saying it had asked only for some of the sanctions to be removed.

One expert suggested that there had been inadequate preparation and that both leaders were too confident in their negotiating skills.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The celebrations began almost immediately. Over the weekend in midtown Manhattan, Lisa Joseph helped organize a “No Collusion Day” rally. In Houston, Anson Klaber took a bottle of Russian vodka and poultry to a dinner party. He wanted his friends to eat crow, but cooked chicken would have to do.

“I get one day where I can gloat about it, and you all get upset,” Mr. Klaber, 43, an apartment building manager, said of his largely liberal circle of friends, who were not amused. Instead, they were crestfallen that a special counsel investigation had, according to the Justice Department, found no coordination between President Trump’s campaign and Russia’s election meddling.

For almost two years, Mr. Trump’s fiercest supporters echoed his attacks against the inquiry, led by former F.B.I. director Robert S. Mueller III, as a “witch hunt” that should be shut down. “No collusion” became their rallying cry, and they sided with congressional Republicans whose efforts to discredit Mr. Mueller had divided Republican lawmakers.

Some conservatives said they decided months or years ago that there could have been no collaboration between the Trump campaign and Moscow.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The European Fine Art Fair in Maastricht, the Netherlands, is a cornucopia like those sometimes depicted in the old master paintings on view, spilling over with riches. A sparkling display of jewelry here, a pale ancient Greek statue over there, not far from a contemporary work in glowing neon.

But everything that goes on view is vetted to ensure that it is authentic, and that process has always been a point of pride for the fair.

Now, measures are being taken to make the vetting even stronger and more independent as about 275 dealers show their wares from Saturday to March 24 at the Maastricht Exhibition and Congress Center. The policy also applies to Tefaf’s other fairs, which take place in New York twice a year.

In an increasingly litigious world, fair organizers thought that more safeguards were needed, even though the decision didn’t exactly thrill the galleries at first.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Something is happening in African literature: The women are coming. For decades now, a river of original and important writing by female authors has been flowing out of that continent — books by writers such as Marlene van Niekerk, of whose second novel Liesl Schillinger wrote in these pages, “books like ‘Agaat’ … are the reason people read novels”; Tsitsi Dangarembga (“Nervous Conditions”); and, of course, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Now that river has burst its banks and become a flood. Namwali Serpell’s extraordinary, ambitious, evocative first novel, “The Old Drift,” contributes powerfully to this new wave.

Interestingly, many of the contemporary books overlap with and even echo one another. Petina Gappah’s forthcoming novel, “Out of Darkness, Shining Light,” takes on the subject of the explorer David Livingstone and his African companions; “The Old Drift” also begins with Livingstone (but then moves on). Serpell’s novel is a multigenerational exploration of Zambia’s past, present and even its near future; another recent debut, “Harmattan Rain,” by Ayesha Harruna Attah, looks at the story of Ghana through the lives of three generations of women. And in September Maaza Mengiste’s “The Shadow King” will take on the subject of the Italian invasion of Ethiopia, moving beyond history to a kind of modern mythmaking, and looking at history primarily through the eyes of its female characters. “The Old Drift,” too, incorporates elements of fabulism into the history of Zambia, and, again, sees that history mostly through women’s eyes. Novuyo Rosa Tshuma’s “House of Stone,” published in the United States in January, has already been highly praised in The Guardian for summing up “not only … Zimbabwean history, but also all of African colonial history” — a large claim on behalf of any novel. Equally large claims have already been made for “The Old Drift,” which early reviewers have garlanded with comparisons to Toni Morrison and Gabriel García Márquez. Meanwhile, another recent novel, Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi’s “Kintu,” has been called a Ugandan “One Hundred Years of Solitude.” Trailing clouds of glory do they come.

[ This book was one of our most anticipated titles of March. See the full list here. ]

“The Old Drift” is a strong and confident enough piece of writing to stand on its own two feet and is perhaps not well served by being placed on the shoulders of giants. Its structure is formal, three parts containing three sections each — “The Grandmothers,” “The Mothers” and “The Children.” Each of the nine sections is centered on one dominant character, all women in the first two parts, and, in the final section, two young men and one young woman. In between are to be found short, italicized sections narrated by an unnamed “we,” which work as a sort of Greek-chorus commentary on the action.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>LOS ANGELES — Robert Mapplethorpe’s photographs are pristine and painful, witty and wicked, forbidding and seductive. The mild-mannered Bryce Dessner is not the first composer I would have thought of to set them to music.

Mr. Dessner — whose hourlong meditation on Mapplethorpe, “Triptych (Eyes of One on Another),” had its premiere at Walt Disney Concert Hall here on Tuesday before touring worldwide — achieved fame as a member of the rock band the National, and has sought a parallel career in the concert hall.

Mellow and unobtrusive, with a heavy debt to Minimalism and its rock-infused progeny, his music is at its best when he’s his own softly suggestive electric guitar soloist. And on a small scale — a bright, vivid set of “Murder Ballades” (2013); the gentle percussion solo “Tromp Miniature” (2014) — his work can be charming. Longer pieces, though conscientiously constructed, tend to go prettily nowhere. (The New York Philharmonic will play “Wires” in November.)

Mr. Dessner was a teenager in Cincinnati in 1990 when a Mapplethorpe exhibition that traveled there, “The Perfect Moment,” became caught up in a classic culture-war conflagration over censorship and government support for the arts. The city’s Contemporary Arts Center and its director faced obscenity charges; they were acquitted in a trial viewed as a victory for free speech.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>On a cached site for the National Front, which has campaigned under the slogan, “It’s O.K. to be white,” reactions to the attack were divided. Some commenters expressed compassion for the victims, while others said the shootings were a “natural outcome.”

“This is ‘bad optics.’ I hope and pray that no one in the ethno-nationalist community has had anything to do with this,” one person wrote. “Because we know what’s coming: government crackdown, surveillance, increased gun control and an emboldened Antifa harassing us.”

Another person called the shootings a “brutal wake-up call” and said the victims deserved “no sympathy.”

A user called Celtic Warrior said, “Harsh medicine, indeed, but sadly, very necessary.”

The Dominion Movement is a year-old group that describes itself as a “fraternity of young New Zealand nationalists” united by the belief that “Europeans are the defining people of this nation and that they were essential in its creation.”

“We oppose the animosity and contempt this system holds for us and our people, we reject the entire concept of White guilt,” a cached version of its website reads.

As of Tuesday, the group’s Twitter and Instagram accounts had been suspended.

Whether these groups or others have a chance to amplify whatever Mr. Tarrant says when he appears in court — his next appearance is scheduled for April 5 — is still unknown. The judge in the case could ban cameras or find other ways to suppress information, according to lawyers.

Richard Peters, the duty lawyer at the suspected gunman’s first court appearance Saturday, said he didn’t know whether the man’s decision to represent himself would draw more attention to the case or less.

But for Ms. Ardern and many others, his efforts are best ignored, in court, and on the internet.

“I don’t have all of the answers now, but we must collectively find them,” she said. “And we must act.”</TEXT>

The weather comes during a winter of extremes. In late January, Chicago broke a record for lowest maximum daily temperature at minus 10 degrees, busting its earlier record of minus 3 degrees. The city also hit a record daily low at minus 23 degrees.

A few days later, in early February, Washington, D.C., broke a 28-year record when highs reached 70 degrees, a balmy temperature more common to South Texas or Los Angeles.

Last month, though, was the first February on record that downtown Los Angeles did not reach 70 degrees, a milestone marked by light grousing from Angelenos. But when it snowed in the city last week, it prompted a flurry of delighted social media posts. And when the Bay Area got a dusting earlier this month, residents of the region got out their sleds.

According to climate experts, increasing weather extremes are in keeping with broader predictions of climate change. Severe weather — be it precipitation or cold — worries observers in the Golden State, where every storm brings the risk of mudslides in fire-scarred communities and flooding. Daniel Swain, a California climate scientist, said that climate change is making extreme swings between warm weather and cold weather, drought and rain, the new normal.

[Read: Both sides of the climate change debate are using extreme weather in their arguments.]

“Things are changing faster than I think has been apparent to a lot of people,” he said. “It seems incremental until it doesn’t.”

He said he had heard stories from Californians who did not think much about wildfires — they were just things on the news — until they found themselves screaming at their children to get in the car before flames reached their homes. He said he had also heard from South Lake Tahoe residents who had owned their homes at lake level for decades and who said that they had noticed their yards were getting blanketed less and less frequently. So when it does snow in years like this, the contrast is more marked.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>While he was the United States attorney for the Southern District of Florida in 2007, Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta oversaw a plea deal for Jeffrey Epstein, the New York financier accused of sexually abusing more than 80 underage girls. Rich and well-connected — his friends and acquaintances included Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton, Kevin Spacey, Woody Allen and Donald Trump — Mr. Epstein faced a 53-page federal indictment that could have put him in prison for life, according to The Miami Herald, which ran a blockbuster expose in November. The F.B.I. was also investigating him on suspicion of masterminding an international sex-trafficking operation.

But Mr. Acosta’s office, working closely with Mr. Epstein’s high-priced defense team — stocked with legal stars such as Alan Dershowitz, Kenneth Starr, Jay Lefkowitz and Roy Black — put together a non-prosecution agreement that let Mr. Epstein avoid federal charges, plead guilty to two state counts of felony prostitution, and serve less than 13 months in a private wing of the Palm Beach County jail, with most days spent on work-release in his office in West Palm Beach. Mr. Epstein was required to register as a sex offender and pay restitution to some of the young women , but the agreement shut down the F.B.I. investigation and gave immunity to all “potential co-conspirators” — including any of Mr. Epstein’s rich and powerful buddies who may have taken a turn with his victims.

It was a deal so sweet it would rot your teeth. It also turned out to be illegal.

Last Thursday , after a decade-long court battle begun by two of Mr. Epstein’s accusers, a federal judge ruled that Mr. Acosta and his team violated the federal Crime Victims’ Rights Act by hiding the details of Mr. Epstein’s deal from his victims — many of whom didn’t know a deal had been in the works until they heard about it on the news. This denied the young women an opportunity to appear at Mr. Epstein’s sentencing hearing. The victims were also led to believe that the F.B.I. investigation would continue. It was a betrayal of countless young women — the full tally of Mr. Epstein’s victims remains unknown — who’d already had their bodies violated and their innocence destroyed.

If even a fraction of the accusations against him are true, Mr. Epstein was no ordinary predator. (Those with a weak stomach may want to skip ahead.) For years, he allegedly turned his Palm Beach mansion into a sex den, luring in teenagers whom he paid and coerced into an array of sexual behavior . Mr. Epstein reportedly groomed some of the teenagers to recruit even younger, fresher victims. He was said to like his girls white and prepubescent looking. One victim has recalled that Mr. Epstein praised her as “pure” — she was 14 at the time — before molesting her. Like many predators, he preferred his victims troubled, making them easier to manipulate and less likely to be believed if they reported him.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Harvey G. Simmons

Toronto

The writer is emeritus professor of political science at York University.

Jamie Daw argues we can transition from Obamacare to Germany’s universal health care system far more easily than we can persuade — whom? — to accept single payer. Poll after poll shows Americans long for a single-payer plan. But we cannot ignore the differences between a country that accepts limits on profiteering and one that celebrates any and all legal means of turning any “opportunity” into a buck.

As long as health insurance companies donate to politicians, we can’t hope for a government that eliminates their profits. Without getting rid of for-profit health insurance, we cannot get the obscene expense of treating illness in this country down to manageable levels. In spite of Dr. Daw’s optimism, we cannot transition from profitability to a system based on the values associated with compassion as long as health insurance companies continue to stand between us and the care we need to thrive.

So let me see if I have this right: Because a German chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, came up with an inefficient way to provide universal health care almost 140 years ago, the United States should now copy his system?

There are too many flaws in Jamie Daw’s case to enumerate in a short letter, but let me take just one: Dr. Daw states, “In Germany, sickness funds leverage market power to secure lower prices, coming together regionally to negotiate contracts with doctors and hospitals .” In the United States, health insurance companies — which are much larger and have much more market power than German sickness funds — have had the ability to negotiate for lower prices for the better part of a century. The result has been what we have — by far the most expensive health care system in the world.

What on earth makes Dr. Daw think that, with a snap of the fingers, this already existing market power will suddenly yield a better result? Private insurance companies add an extra layer of expense that is totally unnecessary. We can do better.

I am an American expat who has been living in Germany for many years and have intimate knowledge of and experience with its health care system. Jamie Daw’s essay is not representative of the realities, pitfalls and serious systemic problems that exist in the German system and do not reflect the fact that most of the population is getting substandard care. Indeed, the German system is just as bad as the American system, just with a different set of failures that need to be addressed.

One important aspect of health care that Jamie Daw does not mention is the education of medical providers. The cost of medical school in Germany is a tiny fraction of the cost in the United States. Medical schools can cost as much as $75,000 per year, or $300,000 in total, for tuition, fees and living expenses. During the additional four to eight years of internship, residency and fellowship, young doctors are barely paid enough to cover basic housing and living costs. Most are not only acquiring substantial debt but also forgoing about 10 years of earning and saving.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Attorney General William P. Barr told congressional leaders in a letter late Friday that the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has concluded his inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election and delivered a report to the Department of Justice.

See the letter here and read a transcript below.

[What’s next? We break it down as well as the major moments in the case. And here’s the latest analysis on Trump and the Mueller report.]

I write to notify you pursuant to 28 C.F.R. § 600.9(a)(3) that Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III has concluded his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and related matters. In addition to this notification, the Special Counsel regulations require that I provide you with “a description and explanation of instances (if any) in which the Attorney General” or acting Attorney General “concluded that a proposed action by a Special Counsel was so inappropriate or unwarranted under established Departmental practices that it should not be pursued.” 28 C.F.R. § 600.9(a)(3). There were no such instances during the Special Counsel’s investigation.

The Special Counsel has submitted to me today a “confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions” he has reached, as required by 28 C.F.R. § 600.8(c). I am reviewing the report and anticipate that I may be in a position to advise you of the Special Counsel’s principal conclusions as soon as this weekend.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Like its car sales, Tesla’s residential solar business has hit turbulence, a problem that may be compounded by the store closings. Tesla had positioned its stores as a retail hub for the renewable-energy age, offering electric cars, solar panels and battery storage for both car and home.

“Similar to our approach to selling vehicles, we are also shifting sales of our energy and solar products worldwide to online only,” Tesla said in a statement. It said the model would allow customers to save thousands of dollars.

But Allison Mond, a senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie, which tracks and supplies solar data for the Solar Energy Industries Association, said the move was likely to be counterproductive. “Online historically is not a very popular way to sell solar,” she said. “It really has not been proven.”

SolarCity, the predecessor to Tesla’s solar business, once controlled two-thirds of the residential market. By the end of last year under Tesla’s control, that share was under 10 percent. The latest move, Ms. Mond said, “just adds to the story that, I think, Tesla does not care about their residential solar business.”

Many Tesla customers say they have purchased cars online with no problems. For trade-ins, they were able to upload photos and get a quote back without going to a showroom for appraisal. But many still balk at buying an automobile — the second most expensive consumer purchase after a home — without seeing it first.

Kevin Smith-Fagan, a television executive in Sacramento, said he did a lot of research online before buying a car, but still preferred to see it up close before making a decision.

“There are intangibles that you can only know by getting into the car,” he said. “There’s a comfort level in knowing exactly what you’re getting.”

Online or otherwise, Mr. Smith-Fagan is unlikely to be a buyer. He drives another electric car, the Nissan Leaf, that he bought used for $9,000. He would love to own a Tesla, he said, “but for 35 grand, it’s not in the cards.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Measles is transmitted by droplets from an infected person’s nose or mouth. The virus can live in the airspace where the person has breathed, coughed or sneezed.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, someone who is not vaccinated “can catch measles just by being in a room where a person with measles has been, up to two hours after that person is gone.”

How safe and effective is the measles vaccine?

The measles-mumps-rubella vaccine is extremely safe and effective. The vast majority of people who contract measles have not been vaccinated.

It does not cause autism.

If I choose not to vaccinate my child, why should anyone else care?

An unvaccinated child can get the virus and spread it to those who can’t protect themselves. Infants and people with compromised immune systems cannot get vaccines.

Why is this a problem now?

Vaccination rates are down worldwide. Public health officials are fighting back, repeatedly pointing out that medical and scientific evidence confirms that vaccines are safe. Still, dangerous misinformation is proliferating.

“This feels like a very real-world manifestation of what can happen when you’re in an echo chamber,” said The Times’s Michael Gold, who has reported on the recent outbreak.

      <TEXT>SEATTLE — Staff members gasped four years ago when Dan Price gathered the 120 employees at Gravity Payments, the company he had founded with his brother, and told them he was raising everyone’s salary to a minimum of $70,000, partly by slashing his own $1.1 million pay to the same level.

The news went viral and provoked a national debate about whether efficient capitalism could have a heart. Some Americans lauded Price for treating employees with dignity. However, on Fox Business he was labeled the “lunatic of all lunatics,” and Rush Limbaugh declared, “I hope this company is a case study in M.B.A. programs on how socialism does not work, because it’s going to fail.”

So I came to Seattle to see what had unfolded: Did Gravity succeed or crash?

There were bumps, no doubt about it. A couple of important employees quit, apparently feeling less valued when new hires were close to them in pay. The publicity forced Gravity, which processes credit card payments for small businesses, to hire additional people to handle a deluge of inquiries. Worst of all, Price’s brother, who owned a stake in the company, sued and alleged that Price hadn’t consulted him on decisions.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Sometimes the Sunday theme is a big secret you need to figure out before you get anywhere, like the proverbial duck the size of a horse. Sometimes it is a bunch of little duckling-size horses that you have to corral one by one, like today’s puzzle. There are seven across clues, at 22, 39, 47, 67, 86, 95 and 116, that each present a cryptic equation. Our job is to solve them, and we get no credit for showing our work.

They all rely on various mathematical operations, I guess, although 95A is really more a notation thing, I guess, if that’s what you would call a decimal. Put your pun hat on for the BB in “3.BB” and you’ll get it: THREE (3) POINT (.) SHOT (BB, as in BB gun).

86A is algebraic, with a variable divisor — X — and four $ signs, making a CASH DIVIDEND (how much we can’t say, but it’s money).

39A is the purest form of a balanced equation — “x — y = x — y.” True — both sides are the SAME DIFFERENCE.

My favorite, which had no actual numbers, was one of the occasional puzzle tricks that I remember thinking of once in the past, probably at one of those family meetings where everyone somberly discusses what to do when the piano falls through the ceiling and we need to know how to settle all the unforeseen debts (the piano was supposed to be full of rare coins, but they were worthless, all lead slugs). It is at 116A, and if you recognize “Esq.” as the lawyerly suffix then you can see what this is POWER OF ATTORNEY — “X” raised to the power of “Esq.” — an exponential quantity of lawyers.

As long as you went to junior high school and know your West Coast newspapers and your satanic numerology, you will ace the rest of this test.

I wish I understood how my brain works. A decade ago I saw a photoshop contest on the theme of “scary road signs,” whose entries included one enforcing a speed limit of the square root of 666. I haven’t the foggiest idea why my brain held onto that image, or why it dragged the memory out kicking and screaming 10 years later just for the sake of generating a “root of all evil” pun. Once it did, though, and because every dang thing becomes a theme in this hobby, there was no way I wasn’t going to run with it. (It wasn’t until writing this blurb that I went looking for the original image, only to discover that it actually showed the square root of 677. I give up, brain.) This represents my second attempt at the concept after the first was rejected by Will, who liked the theme but not the execution; some but not all of the theme entries in that original go-round relied on homophones, like SINE OF THE TIMES (sin[AxB]) and HALF A GOOD DAY (. 5 x 12/25), which proved inconsistent. The do-over is much tighter over all with a minimum of wince-and-hide-my-eyes fill, which isn’t to say that I wouldn’t love to gut the SW corner another six times. The fill went relatively quickly, although the nipping and tucking portion of the process dragged on for quite a while. You’d think I’d have learned by now to hack away at the center first, where everything crashes into everything else Michael Bay-style, but old habits die awfully hard. And yes, I was a math major before switching to English, which is as good an explanation not only for this puzzle but also for why I do this in the first place. Such is life.

      <TEXT>There is an official lineup of nine theme answers running across today, easily distinguished in the grid by shading or circled boxes, depending on where you solve. The clues are straightforward, not punny. Your job is to solve them and toss a letter out of each to get a baseball team, then save those letters in order from top to bottom to get a nine-letter term that is used in baseball, in life and, certainly, in a life spent (even partially) concerned with baseball. There’s also a revealer, at 76D, to really drive everything home.

If you know your baseball teams, this will definitely help you run through these entries, which tend to be pretty broad — I needed plenty of crosses for several. Since the theme was laid out on a platter, the difficulty of the theme clues was pretty de rigueur, as far as I was concerned, so no complaints.

I think I had the fewest issues with the entries that had complete teams in their shaded areas, with an extra letter at the beginning of the end — these include 25A, 39A, 84A and 105A. I knew these teams and they made sense as parts of the answers to these clues. I also knew FRED SAVAGE off the bat (pardon the pun!) and CASTRO STREET, and the other two weren’t terribly obscure.

I was a bit slower when confronted with less straightforward instances, and “my” team was the last to fall for me, oddly enough. I solved PAID RESPECTS and TELEVANGELISM without much issue, then PORT WINES and SCRUB SUITS with the help of some crosses. I don’t know why I got stuck on __ __ __ __ SAUCE, sitting on my couch in Queens about a 30-minute walk from Citi Field, but I did. I think of MEAT SAUCE as “red sauce” I guess.

If you keep track of those extra letters in each highlighted area, you get the same word as you do when you solve 76D: SACRIFICE. In baseball, a SACRIFICE hit, either a bunt or fly, is when a player hits a ball that’s caught or fielded, preventing that player from taking a base and counting an out against him, but allowing another teammate on base to advance and possibly score.

This puzzle is a reworking of a 15x15 puzzle I wrote a couple of years ago for a now-defunct crossword service called Aries Xword. That puzzle used BUNT as the extra letters that needed to be removed to reveal the baseball team. While I liked the idea, BUNT works only from a baseball standpoint and not so much from a wordplay standpoint. SACRIFICE works much better as the bonus word, as this can explain the wordplay mechanism as well as tie into the baseball theme. This was a challenging grid to pull off, as it’s tough working with nine theme entries that need to be in top-to-bottom order. Getting SACRIFICE to cut through two of the themers was an unplanned bonus. I tried to space out the themers as much as possible so the crossing down entries wouldn’t intersect more than two themers. SPY STORY is the only entry that crosses three themers, and all told I like the grid that emerged considering the constraints of the theme. I know not everyone is a baseball fan, but this is one of those “stealth” sports themes — you don’t need any specific knowledge of baseball to solve the puzzle as the teams are hidden within common phrases. I hope this is an enjoyable challenge for baseball fans and wordplay fans alike!

      <TEXT>But a close examination of Mr. Goodman’s decades of work as a money guru reveals the many angles he worked. He made his living not just with books and speaking gigs, but as a paid ambassador for companies offering financial services.

The companies Mr. Goodman endorsed were a motley assortment, strange bedfellows for a man who made his bones at one of the country’s most respected financial publications. He had financial relationships with companies that promise to settle your debts for pennies on the dollar and allow you to borrow money using fine art and luxury handbags as collateral. And he dabbled in lending to borrowers via high-interest payday loans, then earned some more by channeling those who could be saved into nonprofit credit counseling.

These arrangements often made Mr. Goodman what is known as an affiliate, which enabled him to earn a commission for each new customer he helped those companies land. At other times, he took a flat fee to offer his endorsement.

Relationships like these are not illegal: Similar arrangements can be at play when people click a link that directs them to an item for sale on Amazon . And these deals are surprisingly common in the financial guru world.

But Mr. Goodman was particularly aggressive in pushing the companies that paid him and sometimes withheld crucial information from his followers when discussing the companies during his media appearances — conduct that, in the case of Woodbridge, particularly rankled the S.E.C.

When I heard about Mr. Goodman’s case, I took inventory of my memory. I had met him twice at conferences and appeared on his radio show in 2017 to promote a book I had written.

Nothing about him seemed out of sorts. Like most of us in the small world of personal finance, he seemed to be trying to help people and hustling hard to figure out a way to make a living at it.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Richard Erdman, a character actor who spanned eras, known to contemporary audiences as the perpetual student Leonard on the sitcom “Community” and to older generations for his roles in movies like “Stalag 17” and television shows like “The Twilight Zone,” died on Saturday in Los Angeles. He was 93.

His death was announced by the film historian Alan K. Rode, a friend.

On “Community,” seen from 2009 to 2015, mostly on NBC but later on Hulu, Mr. Erdman played the singularly annoying member of a group of elderly students who were known as the Hipsters because they had had hip replacements.

His character claimed to have been a member of the child comedy troupe the Little Rascals — and while Mr. Erdman himself was not, he played hundreds of other roles in a career that began in the 1940s.

Among his best-known early movies was “Stalag 17,” the celebrated 1953 Billy Wilder dark comedy set in a German prisoner-of-war camp during World War II, in which he played the barracks chief Sgt. Hoffy Hoffman.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — Roger Federer finished with a flurry of aces and advanced to the fourth round of the Miami Open by beating Filip Krajinovic, 7-5, 6-3, on Monday.

In the final game, Federer smacked aces on the first three points. An ace on the next point was overturned by a replay review, and instead Krajinovic dumped the last shot into the net.

Federer finished with 14 aces and pulled away after converting only one of his first eight break-point chances.

Seeded fourth, Federer improved to 14-2 this year. He made his Miami debut 20 years ago and won the tournament in 2005, 2006 and 2017, when it was played on Key Biscayne.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>We’ve eradicated measles. Hurray! Oh, no! Now there’s no way I’ll go viral. Cheer up, Measles. No vaccine can hold you down. But everyone will take the vaccine and we’ll be locked up in here forever. Not everyone will take the vaccine. But, Polio, who wouldn’t want to protect their kids from us using the most studied, understood and effective medical advancements ever achieved in human history? You’d be surprised, Measles. The human brain’s got a lot of tricks that make bad ideas seem reasonable. Here, let me show you. Vaccines are dangerous. My sister’s kids got sick every time they got a vaccine. Oh, I know that one. That’s called an anecdote. That’s right, Measles. People love stories that confirm their suspicions, and they can’t help but remember that story instead of the many other stories with a different ending, because humans can’t escape something called “confirmation bias.” And it works like this. This one commuter — he can’t help but miss the train. He’s sure he loses and he’s never won — Every time. Even though it’s 50/50 when he’s gotten through. The story in his mind is said and done, yeah. He tends to count the hits and dismiss the misses. A picture forms in his mind. It fits the frame but the framer is suspicious, so caught up in his grind. It’s natural for the brain to not clock the moment he got to work on time with ease. He can’t recall the data that doesn’t fit. He sees what he wants to see. But scientists have been wrong so many times. And they can’t even be 100 percent certain. It’s all just a theory. They call that the “perfectionist fallacy,” where people think that without complete certainty, all assumptions are equal. And boy, is that wrong. Well, it’s true there used to be phrenology. And remember alchemy was hip. Eggs were good, then bad, then good, then bad for you. Don’t know what’s what. The facts, they seem to flip. Yeah! Darn it. Yes, it’s a theory, but so is light, gravity, space and time. Evidence and experiments work to prove it and blow your mind. It’s hard to comprehend that science might write a song and then change the key. It’s a method to learn, not just be right. They see what they want to see. But it’s undeniable that as they increased the vaccine scheduling, autism diagnoses skyrocketed. That logical fallacy is called “confusing correlation with causation.” And humans do it all the time. When summer’s burning, ice cream sales — they go sky-high. Right beside it goes the murder rate. Yeah. We might conclude that frozen treats lead us to die, but that’s not true. They really just relate. Yeah! The human mind is compromised when swayed by emotional weight. When you’re a pattern-seeking primate, it’s second nature to conflate. The data is so close that it seems to prove that A plus B caused C. But A and B are just simultaneous. They see what they want to see. First, you mandate vaccines. Next, you’re making all the choices for my family. Take that “slippery slope” argument far enough and I’ll have a comeback. So you think it’s healthy to pump kids’ bodies full of toxins? I’m going to buy that straw man a drink. I’m sorry, there’s no way I’m vaccinating my children. Oh, it’s happening. I’m really contracted, Polio. I knew you could do it. Well, goodbye, Polio. Enjoy it while you can, Measles. After a few outbreaks, they’ll try vaccines again. [choir sings]</TEXT>

      <TEXT>But it was the raw, cry from the soul new work, “The Just and the Blind,” that has stayed with me from my marathon. Part of Carnegie’s 125 Commissions Project, begun in honor of the hall’s 125th birthday in 2016, it’s a 60-minute piece by the spoken-word poet Marc Bamuthi Joseph, with music by Daniel Bernard Roumain. Though it includes a dancer (Drew Dollaz), a vocalist (Somi) and projected animations and videos, the work is driven by Mr. Joseph’s stinging, brilliant words and is structured as a series of vignettes. Mr. Joseph voices the thoughts of a black father who admits to being afraid when, at night, he walks past young black men who look the same age as his son. Every day, he tells his son, the boy’s main mission in life is “to come home to me.”

Stretches of Mr. Roumain’s score, which he mostly plays on piano and violin, are alternately jazzy and modernist. A rhythmically frenetic section will segue into a breezily cool passage. But Mr. Roumain knows when to pull the music back so Mr. Joseph’s searing words can do their work.

Is this classical music? Perhaps not by traditional definitions. But it speaks to where Carnegie has come that it fit in at the hall just as well as the Vienna Philharmonic.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Unfortunately the top divisions of college football and basketball have become predictable to the point of boredom. Sure, there is the occasional interloper (Virginia Commonwealth University, George Mason, Butler), but generally the same teams are in the mix in both sports. Think Alabama and Clemson in football, and Duke, Kentucky, North Carolina and Michigan in basketball .

We should face facts, pay the students and be done with the romantic notion that this is all about school spirit and amateur competition. It is all about money and nothing more.

Some rule, any rule, that would keep students in school for four years would be more in keeping with the spirit of the National Collegiate Athletic Association. However, given the level of money and corruption, real change is not going to happen. Paying the athletes would be at least a small step toward honesty.

Cody J. McDavis says paying college athletes would create an “arms race” in which only a select group of college programs could compete. In reality, the arms race is exactly how college sports currently function. This is particularly true for major college football and basketball programs.

Colleges build multimillion-dollar sports facilities to attract top recruits. And salaries for coaches at major football and basketball programs have ballooned in recent years. What would you call this if not an arms race? Worse yet, because the N.C.A.A. cartel has prevented the players from receiving fair compensation, the winners in this arms race are the coaches and athletic directors. Unsurprisingly, these are usually the first people to argue against paying players.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Peter Hurford, a British organist, composer and choir director known for his incisive, buoyant recordings of Bach, died on March 3 in St. Albans, England, just north of London. He was 88.

His death was announced by the St. Albans International Organ Festival, which he founded in 1963.

Mr. Hurford made his name internationally by recording Bach’s complete organ works for Decca in the late 1970s and early ’80s.

When the record industry was booming, such an encyclopedic endeavor was almost the norm for organists of stature. Many managed it once; a few, like Helmut Walcha, achieved it twice; Marie-Claire Alain somehow did it three times.

But while other organists might have had a loftier vision for this music, none played it on record with quite the commitment to authenticity and the all-around good sense of Mr. Hurford.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>JUPITER, Fla. — The Republican National Committee promised an “evening reception with Donald J. Trump” last March at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla.

A contribution of $2,700 toward the president’s re-election would get you in the door. Two seats for dinner were on offer for $25,000. And there was a third option: for $50,000, dinner for two and a photo with Mr. Trump.

Cindy Yang was determined to get the photo.

But there was a hurdle. The invitation limited campaign contributions to $5,400 per person, so Ms. Yang, a Chinese immigrant who had set up a string of day spas in Florida and was active in groups backed by the Chinese government and Communist Party, needed others to chip in.

Over the weeks leading up to the event, at least nine people in Ms. Yang’s orbit, some of them with modest incomes, made donations at exactly $5,400. She ended up at the dinner.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>A more affordable version with a range of about 230 miles and a starting price of $39,000 is supposed to go into production in spring 2021.

Tesla said it aimed to offer the Model Y in the United States, Canada, Mexico, China, Germany, the Netherlands and a number of other European countries.

Investors seemed unimpressed by the rollout. Tesla’s shares declined 5 percent on Friday.

Tesla is confronting sales challenges in Europe and China, markets it has been counting on for expansion. The company has also faced some operational uncertainty. Two weeks ago, Mr. Musk announced that Tesla would begin selling a long-awaited version of its Model 3 sedan priced at $35,000, $8,000 less than the cheapest current version. But he said Tesla would lose money in the first quarter, and analysts question whether Tesla can ever make money on the car at the lower price.

Tesla originally said customers would have to wait two to four weeks for delivery of the $35,000 Model 3. It now says the wait is six to eight weeks because of the volume of orders.

Sales of Tesla’s other models, the Model S luxury sedan and Model X sport utility vehicle, have been flattening. And analysts suspect that demand for Tesla vehicles has softened since the beginning of the year, when the federal tax credit available to Tesla customers fell by half, raising the total cost for buyers. Until the end of 2018, Tesla buyers were eligible for a credit of $7,500. That fell to $3,850 on Jan. 1, essentially raising the price of Tesla cars.

Tesla responded with a series of price cuts to lift sales. In a conference call in January, Mr. Musk said many customers could not afford the company’s cars.

To cut costs, Tesla announced that it would close most of its stores around the country. Days later, it backtracked and decided to keep many of the stores, and to reopen some that had already closed, though it affirmed a shift toward online-only sales. It also reversed direction on pricing, saying it would increase prices on all its cars except the $35,000 version of the Model 3.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Samsung Electronics warned on Tuesday that it would report disappointing financial results thanks to slumping prices for chips and LCD screens, in another sign of slowing demand for smartphones and other gadgets.

The South Korean electronics giant said it was anticipating a “widening price fall among major products” for the first three months of the year amid “weakening overall demand” for its products. The disclosure was unusual for Samsung, which typically offers a forecast of its financial performance shortly after the end of its quarterly period.

The announcement from one of the workhorses of the consumer electronics industry is the latest indication of waning global demand for sophisticated tech products. It comes against the backdrop of a 7 percent decline in smartphone shipments globally during the fourth quarter of 2018, the fifth quarterly decline, according to an analysis by the Hong Kong-based research firm Counterpoint.

The change, in part, comes as consumers hold on to their smartphones longer, unconvinced of the need to upgrade to new models that offer only incremental technological improvements.</TEXT>

Most titles in one year, in 2006. The first came against Gaël Monfils in Doha, Qatar, in January; the last against James Blake at the Masters Cup, the former name of the year-end finals, in Shanghai in November.

      <TEXT>Do you follow any social media influencers? If yes, why?

Would you want to be an influencer? Would you be willing to promote and market products on your social media feed if it meant earning lots of money?

In “Online and Making Thousands, at Age 4: Meet the Kidfluencers,” Sapna Maheshwari writes:

Samia was an influencer before she could talk. Her parents, Adam and LaToya Ali, are influencers themselves and began chronicling Samia’s impending arrival on YouTube and Instagram in 2014, once Ms. Ali learned she was pregnant. “Samia’s birth video is on YouTube, so she’s pretty much been born into social media,” Mr. Ali said. Samia is now 4 and has 143,000 followers on Instagram and 203,000 subscribers on YouTube. Her feeds are mostly populated with posts of her posing and playing, but they also feature paid promotions for brands like Crayola and HomeStyle Harvest chicken nuggets. There are instances when “Samia can’t verbatim get the message out,” Mr. Ali, who lives in the Atlanta area, said of the promotional posts. “Sometimes, their talking points are not kid talk, so LaToya would need to appear, or myself, to relay those because those are key deliverables that the brands want.” Welcome to the world of kidfluencers. Brands have flocked to influencers — individuals, famous or not, with large followings on social media — for years, hoping their online popularity will prompt their fans to buy the products they vouch for. Then child influencers started appearing on their parents’ profiles, a surreal but seemingly harmless offshoot of this phenomenon. Now, advertisers like Walmart, Staples and Mattel are bankrolling lucrative endorsements deals for toddlers and tweens with large followings and their own verified profiles on YouTube and Instagram. As a result, children too young to make their own accounts on the platforms are being turned into tastemakers.

The article describes how much money can be made as an influencer:

That can mean big money for the families of kidfluencers. Kyler Fisher, the father of 2-year-old identical twins who have more than two million followers on Instagram, said a sponsored post on the girls’ account could fetch between $10,000 and $20,000. The twins, Taytum and Oakley, have promoted car seats and Carnival Cruise Lines on Instagram. They are also central to the success of their parents’ YouTube channel, Kyler &amp; Mad, which has about three million subscribers. Promotions on the family YouTube channel can draw $25,000 to $50,000. Fans are so interested in the family that their third child, due the first week of March, already has 112,000 Instagram followers. “My kids complete the package, man,” Mr. Fisher said. “If we didn’t have the girls, I can’t imagine being as far as we are.”

Students, read the entire article, then tell us:

— What is your reaction to the article? Should children be social media influencers? Why or why not? What age is or isn’t appropriate?

— Do you follow any influencers? If yes, do they promote products on their social media feeds?

— Would you want to be a paid influencer? Why or why not? Do you think your parents would let you?

— Should parents allow their children to be child influencers? Would you let a younger sibling or your own children be paid influencers?

— The article describes the problems in regulating the phenomenon of child influencers:

Children’s television, overseen by the Federal Communications Commission, has rules that separate ads from content and limit product placement and promotions by a program’s host or characters. The internet doesn’t. YouTube has its own guidelines for children’s advertising, but they are often hard to police. For example, the YouTube Kids app, designed for children 12 and under, is not supposed to contain sponsored content, but The New York Times found several paid advertorial videos from influencers there for companies like Walmart, DreamWorks and Claire’s.

Should advertisers and brands be able to use young people as influencers on social media? Should companies like Instagram and YouTube revise their policies on advertising and children? Should there be more regulations for the internet and social media to protect children?

Students 13 and older are invited to comment. All comments are moderated by the Learning Network staff, but please keep in mind that once your comment is accepted, it will be made public.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Others called the ejection incomprehensible and demanded an apology from the speaker.

Danes are used to great flexibility to balance work and family, with a year of paid parental leave, paid days off for parents when their children are ill, and subsidized kindergartens. Still, some say that they struggle to be dedicated employees (or lawmakers) and parents at the same time, and expect some leniency when they bend tradition.

Ms. Abildgaard explained in her post that she would not normally bring her child to the chamber but had chosen to return to work early in order “to serve democracy.” A vote had unexpectedly required her presence and her husband could not make it to Parliament in time to take care of their 5-month-old daughter, Esther Marie.

The girl had been silent and “in a good mood” with a pacifier in her mouth in the chamber, Ms. Abildgaard said, who added that she had made arrangements for her secretary to take the baby if she began making noise.

“We obviously did not want to disturb the meeting!” she wrote.

There are no regulations on babies’ access to the chamber, but the Parliament’s rules say it is the duty of the speaker to maintain order and provide room for “dignified discussions.”

Ms. Kjaersgaard took to Twitter on Tuesday to defend her decision, saying she had “quietly” asked a secretary to tell Ms. Abildgaard that “it’s not good” to bring babies to the chamber, adding that it had been a minor issue.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>How the commission chooses to respond to Facebook’s repeated abuses will determine whether it is willing or able to promote competition and protect consumers. If the commission does conclude that Facebook has violated the consent order, how it fixes this problem through a legal remedy will be a test of its effectiveness. The commission has the authority to impose substantial fines on Facebook. Given that the corporation had more than $55 billion in revenue in 2018 alone, even a fine in the low billions of dollars will amount to a slap on the wrist, a mere cost of doing business.

Moreover, because Facebook is a repeat offender, it is critical that the commission’s response is strong enough to prevent future violations. America’s laws are not suggestions. When a company has repeatedly shown contempt for its legal commitments, the remedy must change how the company operates. Enforcement agencies can do this through deep reforms of the company’s structure. This includes removing members of the company’s board, or even top executives, along with other changes to the company’s business model to address dysfunction at the top.

The F.T.C. can also pursue other ways to fix this problem. For example, after German antitrust enforcers found that Facebook abused its dominant market position, it required Facebook to stop combining different sources of its users’ data without their consent.

But the commission should not stop there.

There is also mounting evidence of anticompetitive conduct by Facebook that may warrant scrutiny by federal antitrust enforcers. For example, the social media goliath has reportedly systematically spied on its rivals, giving it valuable information on how people used competitive products.

Facebook’s predatory acquisition strategy has also arguably resulted in fewer innovative services. When it bought TBH, a polling app popular with teenagers, Facebook announced that the app would still operate independently and under its own brand. Less than a year later, Facebook scuttled it due to “low usage.”

Facebook also appears to have used its dominance to cripple other competitive threats by cutting them off from its massive network. In 2013, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, personally approved the company’s decision to block Vine, a fast-growing rival, from a critical Facebook feature, to the advantage of its own online video service.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>So, what to do about the pecan pie?

I thought about ordering one from a fancy Los Angeles bakery and having it delivered to Will at the book depository. But no, that didn’t feel special. I sat down to paint a little watercolor pecan pie, but all I saw was a brown gooey mess. I wanted Will’s pecan pie to sing. A friend suggested that I send him a copy of one of the children’s books I had written and draw a little pecan pie on the interior. Perfect.

And so with a Micron pen (the same type I had used to draw in those sketchbooks more than a decade ago) I drew Will a pecan pie. The book I chose to send him is called “Let’s Go!” It’s about an elephant named Tuski (a play on tusk and taxi, since Tuski drives a taxi) and a bird named Bird out on a joy ride and the surprises they experience along the way. Drawing and a pecan pie for Will — come on now, let’s go.

Sarah Williamson is an art director at The New York Times and an author and illustrator of children’s books, including “Let’s Go!,” “Where Are You?” and the forthcoming “Elevator Bird.”

      <TEXT>Subversion comes in many forms, and one of the most effective is dark humor. Charles Yu’s story “Good News Bad News,” a collection of headlines from the future, demonstrates how insurmountable our problems feel when presented in the chill language of journalese. As Yu rolls through the headlines, we learn that refugee families are settling on the moon; climate change is still being debated a millennium from now; scientists have confirmed that we’re living in a simulation; “delegates from Kingdom Plantae, the world’s first nation-state of sentient trees,” are going to the United Nations; and the 10-day forecast is:

Yu’s future is as depressing as it is hot. The human race is still running on the hamster wheel toward doom. Except for the sentient trees, “Good News Bad News” seems like mostly bad news to me.

Unbearable heat is also the central motif of Catherynne M. Valente’s story “The Sun in Exile,” a parable that illustrates the absurdity of climate change denial. The story opens in a scorched world, where everything is cooking down to its essence: “Tomatoes simmered on the vine … and an entire city evaporated into steam like so much water in a copper-bottomed pot.” Yet even as people fry, a leader named Papa Ubu denies that it is hot at all. He wears winter gear and gives speeches about the terrible cold, while his daughter, who is “as beautiful and unmoving as carved ice,” travels through the country handing out blankets to sweaty people who “shone like their skin was made of diamonds.” Soon the word “hot” is banned so as to “not torment the suffering.” Like “The Emperor’s New Clothes,” Valente’s story is a study in how the powerful, through manipulation and the suppression of speech, create an alternate reality for the masses, one that contradicts both fact and lived experience. Such dystopian fairy tales reduce complexity to its lowest point, and can be frustrating to read, but Valente successfully lays bare the dangers of a leader who creates his own reality. One leaves “A People’s Future of the United States” understanding that imaginary worlds can create a heaven or a hell, depending on your ideology. As N. K. Jemisin, whose work appears in this collection, is quoted in the publicity materials: “Imagination is where revolution begins. ”

While there is nothing particularly revolutionary about THE DEVIL ASPECT (Doubleday, $27.95), the beguiling and gruesome new horror thriller by the British novelist Craig Russell, it is a wildly entertaining story that grabs you on Page 1 and drags you into its dark world kicking and screaming. That’s a good thing, as far as I’m concerned. Russell has created a truly frightening story, one that gets under your skin slowly, then goes deep, like the tip of a butcher knife. I read the novel one snowy night by the fire, unable to sleep until I finished, then unable to sleep once I had.

Czechoslovakia, 1935: We follow Dr. Viktor Kosarek, a dashing, brilliant psychiatrist, as he takes his new position at the Hrad Orlu Asylum, a gloomy castle in the town of Mlada Boleslav. Kosarek, a former student of Carl Jung, has developed an experimental treatment he plans to try on the six criminally insane patients confined at Hrad Orlu, all notorious killers known as the Devil’s Six. As Kosarek takes these killers back through their crimes via drug-induced hypnosis, a detective in Prague leads an investigation into a Jack the Ripper copycat killer. The hunt for the murderer merges with Dr. Kosarek’s experiments on the Devil’s Six, creating a suspenseful psychological mystery. Mladek, a clown whose alter ego Harlequin killed children, says at one point: “The truth is the Devil comes into our lives, at least once, at one time or another. Everyone encounters him, but most don’t know he’s there.”

While Harlequin would have you meet the Devil in person, every witch worth her grimoire knows that evil is best carried out by a spirit companion, or familiar. Stacey Halls’s debut novel, THE FAMILIARS (Mira, $26.99), explores the power a group of witches wields over a small 17th-century English community. It is 1612 in the county of Lancashire, and the young and spunky Fleetwood Shuttleworth, wife of a rich country gentleman, desperately wants a child after three stillbirths. Pregnant and fearful, Fleetwood hires a midwife, Alice Gray, with connections to a group of women accused of witchcraft. For those acquainted with the history of English witch trials, and the famous conviction of the Pendle witches in Lancashire in 1612, Halls’s novel offers a rich and atmospheric reimagining of a historical period rife with religious tensions, superstitions, misogyny and fear.

We experience the story through 17-year-old Fleetwood’s perspective, with all her insecurities and ambitions. There are moments when Fleetwood’s many conflicts — with her mother, her servants, her less than lusty husband — feel a tad, well, familiar. That said, through Fleetwood’s dilemma we are privy to the atmosphere of paranoia and fear that accompanies a veritable mass hysteria. Now, with so many high-profile men claiming to be victims of a witch hunt, it’s good to understand what a real one looks like. In Pendle, 12 people were accused of witchcraft; 11 were tried. Nine were found guilty, one died awaiting trial and one went free. Not great odds, fellas.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The second phase of the case, which begins Wednesday, will focus on whether Monsanto, which was acquired by Bayer AG last year, should be held liable for partly causing Mr. Hardeman’s cancer, said his lawyer, Jennifer Moore. Ms. Moore said lawyers would seek to prove that Monsanto manipulated public opinion and science to play down Roundup’s health risks.

Lawyers will argue that Monsanto knew or should have known that Roundup causes cancer, Ms. Moore said in an interview Tuesday. Mr. Hardeman’s team will ask that the jury have the company pay his medical bills and an undetermined amount of damages, she added.

“We feel confident based on the evidence that a jury, when presented with all of the evidence, will see that Monsanto has committed 40 years of corporate malfeasance,” Ms. Moore said.

Bayer said in a statement Tuesday that it was disappointed in the jury’s verdict and that “the evidence in phase two will show that Monsanto’s conduct has been appropriate and the company should not be liable for Mr. Hardeman’s cancer.”

“We have great sympathy for Mr. Hardeman and his family, but an extensive body of science supports the conclusion that Roundup was not the cause of his cancer,” Bayer said in the statement. “Bayer stands behind these products and will vigorously defend them.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WASHINGTON — Television crews have been positioned outside the offices of the special counsel, the federal courthouse and, at least before they were asked to leave, the McLean, Va., home of the new attorney general, William P. Barr.

Lawmakers on Capitol Hill are so desperate for hints that they are asking aides to call Justice Department contacts to beg for morsels.

Publishing houses are scrambling to produce instant books of the findings. Newspapers are deploying small armies of reporters. At bars, restaurants, cocktail parties and street corners, people are asking one another the same question.

When is it coming out?

Washington — jittery, full of rumor, like a becalmed ship in the dead air before a coming storm — is waiting for the report of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether President Trump or his aides conspired in the effort or obstructed justice. It may or may not be the report of the century, it may or may not be ready soon, and it may be only a few pages long. But it is unquestionably one of the capital’s most anticipated documents since the Starr Report on President Bill Clinton arrived by the truckload on Capitol Hill in September 1998.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Shortly after Delia Owens’s “Where the Crawdads Sing” was published last Aug. 14, Reese Witherspoon picked it as a selection for her Hello Sunshine book club, telling The Times she “loved every page of it.” It was a lucky break. The debut novel — which had a solid first printing of 27,500 — landed at No. 9 on the paper’s best-seller list on Sept. 16.

Then the book, about a young girl surviving alone in a coastal North Carolina marsh, did something unusual. Instead of lingering at the bottom of the list for a few weeks before slipping off altogether, as a small novel might be expected to do, “Where the Crawdads Sing” started to climb — and climb, and climb — finally reaching No. 1 on Jan. 20, which is where you can still find it today. It has now been on the list for 29 weeks.

So what happened? How has a small literary novel flourished while hyped books by big-name authors have flashed on and off the list? “Reese’s pick skyrocketed awareness,” says Alexis Welby, the publicity director of Putnam, “and the word-of-mouth just continued to grow from there.” Readers, she says, “just have to push the book into the hands of others so they can talk about it.” It’s now been rated over 125,000 times on Goodreads and has a 5-star rating on Amazon, where it’s been reviewed more than 7,400 times.

In December, the novel got another nice shot of publicity when Fox 2000 acquired it for film and tapped Witherspoon to produce.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Late last month, a young man named Kosoko Jackson became the second young adult author in five weeks to pull a debut work just before it hit the shelves . His book, “A Place for Wolves,” ran afoul of the sensibilities of the Twitter gatekeeping class, which deemed it insensitive to Muslims and unduly focused on people of privilege.

There was an obvious irony to his story, a karmic boomerang: Jackson, who is black and gay, often worked as a “sensitivity reader” for major publishing houses, which meant his job was to flag just the sort of problem content for which he was now being run out of town. He was Robespierre with his own neck in the cradle of the guillotine. One of the captains of “cancel culture” — which urges people to shun the insensitive, the oppressive, the morally questionable — got canceled himself.

As often happens with these things, the online pile-on was mainly led by people who hadn’t read Jackson’s book. It did start with someone who had — a reader who’d written an intemperate, if highly impassioned, review of an advance copy for the community website Goodreads. But it most likely would have remained just that, a pan from a citizen critic, had the review not been noticed by that corner of Twitter that’s obsessed with Y.A. fiction. Even by Twitter standards, it’s a hothouse subculture — self-conscious, emotional, quick to injure. Not unlike teenagers themselves.

I have read Jackson’s book. Before I get to the actual contents, let’s get this out of the way: What happened to Jackson is frightening. Purity tests are the tools of fanatics, and the quest for purity ultimately becomes indistinguishable from the quest for power. In the Twitterverse, ideologues have far more power than moderates. They have more followers; their tweets get more traction (studies have shown that emotional tweets pretty much always have more traction); they set the terms of their neighborhood’s culture and tone.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Battle against Ebola epidemic in Congo is in trouble

The war-torn northeastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo is suffering through the second-longest Ebola outbreak on record. Over seven months, there have been 907 recorded cases and 569 deaths. And despite the use of promising antiviral drugs and a recent vaccine, there is no end in sight.

What’s worse, heavy-handed measures by outside aid organizations, the local police and the military have alienated communities, leading some people to spurn treatment and even attack treatment centers. On Thursday, Dr. Joanne Liu, the international president of Doctors Without Borders, said that her own organization was among those that had fallen short. She called on medical teams to treat patients “as humans and not as a biothreat.”

On the ground: More than 80,000 people have been vaccinated, but the region where the outbreak occurred is a longtime conflict zone, with up to 100 armed groups as well as security forces posing a constant threat of violence. “In the last month alone, there were more than 30 different incidents and attacks against elements of the response” to Ebola, Dr. Liu said.

Quote: Referring to affected communities, Dr. Liu said, “They hear constant advice to wash their hands, but nothing about the lack of soap and water. They see their relatives sprayed with chlorine and wrapped in plastic bags, buried without ceremony. Then they see their possessions burned.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Also, be careful not to fall into that hoary cliché of abandoning your tried-and-true friends for an exciting new beau. I’m not saying you have. But the more secure your roommates feel about your friendship, which you may shore up by spending time with them, the more likely they will be to support your romance (or, at least, not express their pretty natural jealousy of it).

Of All the Names in the Baby Book …

My one-year-old daughter is named Raphaëlle Lucrezia. My neighbor in our small apartment block recently acquired two dogs and named them Raphaëlle and Lulu. I know the spelling of the dog’s name is the same as my daughter’s because all apartment owners must approve a written request for new dogs in the building. I am offended that my neighbor used my child’s name for a dog. May I ask her to rename it?

It seems to me you missed your golden opportunity. Why did you sign the permission slip for a dog named Raphaëlle? You might have had a constructive talk about it, with some leverage, beforehand. (I gather you don’t mind the Lucrezia-Lulu connection.)

But now the dogs are named and presumably approved by the building. You can still go to your neighbor and say, “I’m uncomfortable that you’ve used my child’s name for your dogs.” Of course, she’s under no obligation to rename them. You don’t own the rights to “Raphaëlle.” Can you possibly reframe this as homage to your outstanding taste?

At a family party, my son and my daughter’s husband argued over politics. It got nasty, then personal. (Yes, alcohol was involved.) The two men are close in age but don’t have much else in common. Now, three months later, my daughter called to tell me they are not coming to my mother’s 80th birthday party because of family tension. She wouldn’t discuss it further. My son says he doesn’t want to see his brother-in-law again. I am heartbroken, but I don’t want to get in the middle of this. Is there anything I can do?</TEXT>

      <TEXT>MANILA — The Philippines officially withdrew from the International Criminal Court on Sunday, after the country’s highest court declined to overrule President Rodrigo Duterte’s decision to leave the world’s only permanent war crimes tribunal.

Manila announced it was withdrawing from the court a year ago, but under court rules, it could not take effect for at least 12 months. The Philippines is the second country to withdraw from the Hague-based body after Burundi, which left in 2017.

Romel Bagares, a lawyer for a coalition of rights activists who had asked the Supreme Court of the Philippines for an injunction against the move, said the Philippine withdrawal was “a terrible setback in the long fight against impunity in the country.”

“It is our last resort when our institutions fail,” Mr. Bagares said of the international court, “and they have grievously been failing in the last two years, with apparent government inaction on thousands of deaths arising from the president’s drug war.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea has started rebuilding the facilities it uses to launch satellites into orbit and test engines and other technologies for its intercontinental ballistic missile program, according to American military analysts and South Korean intelligence officials.

The revelation comes days after the breakdown of the second summit meeting between the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, and President Trump last week in Hanoi, Vietnam. It could be a first sign that North Korea is preparing to end its moratorium on missile tests, which Mr. Trump has claimed as a major diplomatic achievement.

North Korea began dismantling the Sohae Satellite Launching Station in Tongchang-ri near its northwestern border with China last summer, after Mr. Kim held his first meeting with Mr. Trump in June in Singapore. It partially took down an engine test site, a rocket launchpad and a rail-mounted building used by engineers to assemble launch vehicles and move them to the launchpad.

The North did not completely dismantle the facilities, and when Mr. Kim met with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea in September, he offered to destroy them in the presence of American experts.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand — The suspected gunman in last week’s attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, was charged with murder for the death of one victim — but the police announced on Thursday that that supposed victim was in fact alive.

A police spokesman said that the charge sheet would be corrected, with a new name, and legal experts said the mistake would not impede prosecution in the mass shooting that left 50 people dead.

“In our system there is a provision to amend the charge at any time, and the issue is whether the amendment is in the interest of justice,” said Jonathan Eaton, a lawyer and former prosecutor specializing in criminal law. “I will imagine there will be a fairly hasty effort to amend that charging document.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>They were rescued the next day by a villager with a canoe.

A couple of miles down the inundated path, two women dried corn on the ground next to a one-room church, whose roof had caved in at a sharp angle, and talked about the floodwaters.

“This high,” said one of the women, Maria Juliai, 27, holding her hand against the wall of the broken church. It was about six feet above the ground.

They, too, had sought refuge in a mango tree.

“We were up the tree Saturday and Sunday,” Ms. Juliai said. “And then four men from the village came to rescue us.”

One of those men, Jambo Domindos, 59, said that he and his friends, all strong swimmers, saved more than a dozen people, including 3-month-old twin girls, from trees.

“When we found them, most of them were crying,” he said.

At the Muda Mufo school, mothers and young children were taking shelter in classrooms or playing in the yard’s soft mud. Most of the men were back home, busy farming. Their families would join them when the water receded more.

Mr. Lazaro said he was eager to leave the shelter.

“I’ll see what the weather is like,” he said, “and then I’ll do machamba again.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Chuck Todd led a wall-to-wall discussion on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” It included commentary on whether the Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke had jumped the gun at a campaign stop on Friday when he said: “This is an unprecedented attack on this country and on our democracy, and we are owed the facts. And if we do not receive them, 243 years in, there’s nothing that guarantees us a 244th.”

On “Fox News Sunday,” the program hosted by Chris Wallace, Representative Doug Collins, Republican of Georgia, said the president had been proved right in repeatedly saying “no collusion.” On the same show, Mr. Nadler called for the release of the entire report and its underlying materials.

Also in the morning hours, on CNN’s “Reliable Sources,” the host Brian Stelter asked of whether reporters and talking heads had inflated expectations.

He seemed to be reacting to an analytical article posted online on Saturday by the Rolling Stone journalist Matt Taibbi, who wrote that the lack of new charges emerging from the report “is a deathblow for the reputation of the American news media.” Mr. Taibbi cited instances of overreaching by some reporters and pundits to make his case.

Mr. Stelter pushed back against that view. “Don’t be fooled by the partisans who cherry-pick the worst mistakes of individual journalists or the craziest ideas from commentators and claim that’s the entire media,” he said.

The problem, Mr. Stelter said, lay in the competing interests of “agenda-driven columnists” and “journalists who report the news.” He put Joy-Ann Reid, of MSNBC, and Jesse Watters, of Fox News, in the agenda-driven camp. Then he rolled a clip of Ms. Reid suggesting that Mr. Barr may have an interest in covering up the facts; and another of Mr. Watters characterizing the Mueller report as “a knockout blow to the Democrats and the press who say, ‘Collusion, collusion, collusion.’”

The Nixon-era reporting led by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein of The Washington Post seemed newly exceptional, now that Mr. Mueller’s work was done. Mr. Bernstein, a CNN contributor who was a guest on Mr. Stelter’s show, praised recent coverage of President Trump and the allegations that have surrounded him. He singled out the journalism of The Wall Street Journal — owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation — as a sign that democracy was working.

Noting its assiduously reported articles on Mr. Trump, Mr. Bernstein said, “It ought to be stressed that the same owner of Fox News published these stories in his paper.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Five residents of a squalid New Mexico compound where a child was found dead last year pleaded not guilty on Thursday to terror charges that they were plotting to kill United States government officials, military personnel and F.B.I. employees.

While federal authorities say the five family members were planning deadly attacks, their lawyers contend they were charged because they are Muslim.

The new charges are included in an indictment handed up last week. The two men and three women — who have been incarcerated on weapons charges since August, after the authorities raided the compound — stand accused of running a terror training camp and using malnourished children, who lived on site, as pawns in their plot.

Their remote desert outpost near the Colorado border was used to store firearms and served as a base from which to prepare to “engage in jihad, to die as martyrs, and to engage in violent acts,” according to the recent indictment.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Ms. Baer later released a statement that said she fell accidentally when her chair “began to tip.”

“Due to an injury I sustained in my foot three days ago, I lost my balance,” she said. “I did not sustain any injury based on what happened today. Larry and I always have been and still are happily married.”

The San Francisco Police Department said Monday that it had investigated the episode and submitted its findings to the office of District Attorney George Gascón. Max Szabo, a spokesman for Mr. Gascón’s office, confirmed that the matter was under review.

A spokesman for Major League Baseball did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. But after the video became public, the league said it was aware of the episode and would &quot;immediately begin to gather the facts.”

A spokesman for the Giants said Monday that Mr. Baer was unavailable for comment. In a statement, the team said it appreciated “the sentiments and perspectives expressed” by the mayor and the civic groups that wrote the open letter.

“We have worked closely with the mayor and with many of the women who authored the letter and we deeply respect them and their work in the community,” the statement said. “We take this matter very seriously and we appreciate their concerns. Because it is currently under review, we have no further comment at this time.”

The open letter was signed by a half-dozen local groups and several civic leaders, including the president of the San Francisco Commission on the Status of Women, a past president of the organization and a member of the board of directors of Bay Area Rapid Transit.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>It’s like being hit with a ton of … blossoms.

“The Orchid Show: Singapore,” the New York Botanical Garden’s 17th annual orchid extravaganza, running through April 28, features the natural species and hybridized sensations of Southeast Asia — upward of 70 percent of the display in the Enid A. Haupt Conservatory. Thousands of them, in hundreds of varieties and every conceivable — and inconceivable — shape, size and color.

The orchid, once an aristocratic rarity, now a ubiquity — you can buy them at Home Depot — is still the most unnatural-looking flower of the natural world, dizzying in its opulent, adamant oddity. And that’s just one on its own.

“It’s actually surpassed the poinsettia as the most horticulturally produced crop in the world,” said Marc Hachadourian, senior curator of orchids at the New York Botanical Garden. “They’re the pandas of the plant world — they’re charismatic, they’re colorful, they’re engaging.”</TEXT>

The sound of breaking glass could be heard early on Sunday morning as boys jumped from the windows of a Queens home that had become engulfed in flames as a result of a fire the authorities said was caused by a burning candle.

The family had not been alerted to the fire because the smoke detector in the two-story home in the quiet Springfield Gardens neighborhood did not function, fire officials said.

One of the children, 8-year-old Tighani Jones — “the baby,” as he was known — did not survive the 2:30 a.m. blaze that also injured six other people, the police said.

Two older boys were able to jump to safety through second-floor windows, neighbors said.

“I took my coat off, my sweater, and wrapped him up,” a neighbor, Dwayne Sundar, said of a boy he said was between 10 and 12 years old.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>BOSTON — David Pastrnak scored three goals and set a career high with five points, sending the Boston Bruins to a 6-3 victory over the Rangers on Wednesday night.

Coming off a 3-1 road trip but disappointed after blowing a two-goal lead Monday night against the N.H.L.-best Tampa Bay Lightning, the Bruins broke it open with four goals in the third period for their 12th straight victory at home. It’s their longest streak since winning 14 straight during the 2008-9 season.

Pastrnak completed his fourth career hat trick and third this season with a power-play goal to make it 4-2 with 7:08 to play, as hats cascaded down from the crowd and littered the ice. He became the first Bruins player with a trio of hat tricks in one season since Cam Neely in 1993-94.

The Bruins had gone 1-7-2 in their last 10 games against the Rangers, including losing the first two meetings this season. Backup goalie Jaroslav Halak made 20 saves. Charlie McAvoy had a goal and Patrice Bergeron the other for Boston, tipping in Pastrnak’s shot.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The concert’s first hour was tight and focused. When playing the concert’s opening work, “In Memoriam Muhal Richard Abrams,” the violinist Jennifer Curtis and the keyboardist Cory Smythe (heard here on celesta) gave a sense of Mr. Sorey’s artistry when working with meditative sparseness. In this mode, the composer’s changes can come slowly — as with the steady movement from a parched, dry violin tone to something more conventionally lovely — yet their culmination often ends up feeling voluptuous. That result is from the variety of effects being presented, as well as the time lavished on each one.

Mr. Sorey tends to reward a listener’s patience, over the course of a set, thanks to starkly contrasting energies. In “Ornations,” the flutist Claire Chase and the clarinetist Joshua Rubin presented the hyperkinetic side of the composer’s style. At some points solo riffs were passed back and forth between the players like friendly provocations. Even better were the urgent passages during which both players seemed taxed to their individual limits, while still needing to listen closely to one another to create a well-blended sense of chaos.

The final opus in this opening set was the New York premiere of “Everything Changes, Nothing Changes,” played by the JACK Quartet. Aptly titled, it seemed both static and constantly in motion. In recalling the more delicate textures heard at the concert’s opening, this piece for string quartet also brought a sense of closure to the first hour.

The music after intermission (and after an onstage Q. and A. between Mr. Sorey and Ms. Chase) was dominated by the world premiere of “Autoschediasms,” a work for creative chamber orchestra. Premised on his personal approach to “spontaneous composition,” Mr. Sorey described the work as being created by all the musicians onstage and himself. (He conducted the players and provided instructional prompts via a small dry-erase board.)

The lengthy piece was not without interest. There were too many fascinating artists for that to be the case. But for me, this performance did not consistently channel the purposeful quality of Mr. Sorey’s other efforts.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Plays written fresh off the news can quickly stale into irrelevance.

If only that were the case with “The Cake,” by Bekah Brunstetter, which remains painfully topical two years since its premiere and even longer since the events it is based on.

Also: If only topicality were enough.

But “The Cake,” a Manhattan Theater Club production that opened on Tuesday at City Center Stage I, is one of those “issue” plays that goes down easy and leaves you undernourished.

The issue here is public accommodation: the right of all people, without discrimination, to “full and equal enjoyment” of businesses and service establishments. One application of that right has been much in the news as courts consider whether bakers, citing religious objections, may refuse to make wedding cakes for gay couples. Last year the Supreme Court decided that, at least in some cases, they may.

The best part of “The Cake” is how it turns the problem inside out, focusing on the private accommodation hidden behind the public. When Della, the vivacious proprietor of Della’s Sweets in Winston-Salem, N.C., decides she cannot bake a cake for a lesbian wedding, no lawsuit is threatened; only feelings are. That’s because Jen, one of the brides, is like a daughter to her; Jen’s mother, who died five years before the action, was Della’s best friend.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Prosecutors sought a life sentence. But Judge Marcia Cooke balked, noting that there were no specific, identifiable victims of his crimes and that the F.B.I. had known what he was doing for years before arresting him — a fact that she said “does not support the government’s argument that Mr. Hassoun poses such a threat to the community that he needs to be imprisoned for the rest of his life.”

In the lawsuit, Mr. Hassoun’s lawyers accused the government of seeking “to impose what amounts to a life sentence on the very same basis that the trial judge considered and rejected.”

The Departments of Homeland Security and Justice declined to comment.

Complicating matters, the lawsuit says that the F.B.I. has produced a memorandum assessing Mr. Hassoun as a security risk for reasons that go beyond his actions two decades ago, citing allegations that he used unspecified “incendiary rhetoric” in Muslim prayer services at the immigration facility and tried to recruit three unidentified fellow detainees for illegal activities.

Neither the government nor his defense team would provide the memo to The New York Times or describe the purported illegal activities. Ms. Hallett and Mr. Manes called the claims false, and said making the details of such “slander” public would only smear their client’s reputation. Part of their argument is that he has a right to a hearing to confront his accusers and contest the credibility of such claims.

While the dispute over Mr. Hassoun is new, the dilemma it raises is not. A longstanding immigration statute says that when a foreigner is subject to a final removal order, the government should take him into custody for deportation. But it does not dictate what should happen if that goal proves impossible.

In June 2001, the Supreme Court rejected the idea that the government can hold such people indefinitely. Writing for a five-justice majority, Justice Stephen G. Breyer said that it would be unconstitutional to interpret the law as permitting perpetual civil detention, and set a general six-month limit for such custody.

Still, in that case, Zadvydas v. Davis, the majority also suggested that exceptions could be made for “special circumstances,” like if a detainee had a mental illness that caused him to pose a threat to public safety. Justice Breyer also noted that the case before the court in 2001 did not involve terrorism.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>No states have moved to do this on their own, for the same reason they drifted to winner-take-all in the first place: Anything else dilutes their power and takes votes away from their favored candidates.

The winner-take-all system has essentially nothing to do with the reasons the founders created the Electoral College, like their concern about investing the masses with the power to pick the president. All of the states now award their electoral votes based on the votes of citizens, rather than on the votes of the state legislatures, as many once did.

The real debate is about regionalism

Just because the winner-take-all system is unintended doesn’t mean there isn’t an argument for it. The main, principled argument for it is that it discourages regionalism and encourages a candidate to appeal broadly throughout the country, rather than to a single region.

Although this doesn’t always work, it sometimes does. The 1888 election again offers a useful example. That year, Democrats won the popular vote by disenfranchising Republican black voters and running up the score in the Deep South, where they won by 70 percent to 26 percent. Republicans overcame that with some narrow victories in big states and more victories over all.

Republicans make a similar claim today about the 2016 election: They argue that Democrats won the popular vote because of their big margin in California, and that the Electoral College properly protected the rest of the country against an imperial California or New York.

But that is not what happened. Mr. Trump’s victory in the Electoral College was mainly because of impressive strength in the traditional battlegrounds, not lopsided and inefficient Democratic strength in their regional bastions. Indeed, Mr. Trump did just as well in his base states — call them Appalachafornia — as Mrs. Clinton did in California.

Mr. Trump’s electoral victory was a product of two factors. One was essentially an accident of state lines. The 2016 results could be flipped just by giving the Florida Panhandle to Alabama and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to Wisconsin. It’s not clear that there was anything about the distribution of Mrs. Clinton’s support that inevitably put it at a disadvantage in a winner-take-all system.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>When the Islamic State raised its black flag over the Syrian city of Raqqa in early 2014, it began its transformation from fringe regional player to fearsome global threat. By the end of that year, it had seized large stretches of territory in Iraq and Syria, creating a rogue state the size of Britain.

Now, the last of that territory — a sliver of land along the Euphrates River in southeastern Syria — has been retaken. Thousands of fighters remain in the region, but they have gone underground, carrying out quick strikes in the region and continuing to promote their ideology worldwide.

Here are some of the major moments in the group’s evolution:

The Islamic State traces its roots to Al Qaeda in Iraq, an offshoot of the terrorist group that attacked the United States on Sept. 11, 2001. The Iraqi affiliate started an insurgency that pushed Iraq to the brink of civil war in 2006 and 2007, before it suffered defeat at the hands of American troops and local militias.

By 2013, remnants of the Qaeda affiliate had rebranded themselves the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, and had identified opportunities in Syria, which was in the third year of its civil war. The Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, an Iraqi, was the architect of the group’s push to seize territory and declare its own state.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>In the ’80s, after years of collecting vintage jewels from antique dealers, Mr. Lane moved to Los Angeles to open up a business of his own. What he found when he arrived were few traces of the Golden Age glamour he’d imagined as an East Coast kid.

At the time, the red carpet was not the widely televised designer-name-dropping opportunity it is today. The first red carpet was only rolled out in 1961, and it took five years for its coverage to be broadcast in color. It wasn’t until E! hired Joan and Melissa Rivers, in 1996, to host its Oscars preshow that the red carpet became a real forum for designer branding and fashion critique, to the delight of viewers at home.

By then Mr. Lane had developed a reputation in the industry, designing engagement rings for young starlets and resetting stones from the ’70s in modern platinum bands. He says that a real turning point was when Renée Zellweger came to his counter in 2001 seeking jewels to wear on the Golden Globes red carpet.

In the intervening years, Mr. Lane took on high-profile custom projects, among them a diamond “M” necklace for Madonna; a marquise-cut engagement ring flanked by smaller pink diamonds for Portia de Rossi from Ellen DeGeneres; and the cushion-cut ring Liam Hemsworth gave to Miley Cyrus when he first proposed. Media and word of mouth have made him one of Hollywood’s favorite jewelers.

Now in his 60s, Mr. Lane oversees an empire that includes his namesake bridal and couture collections, as well as a budget line of wedding rings with Kay Jewelers. To maintain balance in his life, he sticks to a strict morning regimen (“up at 7, breakfast, at the gym by 9, half-hour elliptical, half-hour training, showering and starting my day”). He’s an Aquarius and believes in astrology, not as a series of rigid archetypes, but as an “energetic system” that guides us. He also, as a general rule, does not watch “The Bachelor.” (“I take a peek,” he said. “But no, I don't have a ‘Bachelor’ party.”)

Perhaps not watching is what’s kept him so optimistic about relationships.

“I do believe love always works out, and that's part of my thematic thing at the wedding as well,” Mr. Lane said. “It's all about the love and affection and sharing that people have. And sometimes it doesn't work out, with all the pretty finery and the lavish or exotic weddings. It just doesn't. But for a moment in time, there is a real unity between people, there's a real magnificent energy that comes out of these people that I'm working with. I focus on that.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>We also know that senior members of the Trump campaign, including the president’s son, son-in-law and campaign chairman, met with Russians who promised “dirt” on Mrs. Clinton. If there was in fact “no collusion,” as the president so often claims, it apparently was not for lack of trying. The special counsel has secured guilty pleas on serious federal felony charges from Trump associates, including Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman, Paul Manafort; the deputy campaign chairman, Rick Gates; a former national security adviser, Michael Flynn; a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos; and Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen.

What do all these men have in common? They lied to investigators about the nature of their relationships with foreign powers, and they worked for the Trump campaign. And that’s before we even start talking about Roger Stone.

Regardless of whether efforts by Trump associates to coordinate with or benefit from interference by Russia or WikiLeaks were criminal, the fact that Mr. Trump and his campaign strategists sought to benefit from a foreign adversary’s efforts to undermine our democracy is one of the greatest breaches of public trust our country has ever witnessed. If Mr. Mueller ultimately determined that indicting the president’s associates for this conduct was not appropriate, that does not mean that there should not be consequences for this outrageous breach of trust.

Though these and other findings have already been made public, many key questions remain. Chief among these is whether the special counsel found evidence that Mr. Trump obstructed justice by engaging in a pattern of conduct calculated to impede investigations of his campaign and his administration, including by firing Mr. Comey; attempting to force out the previous attorney general, Jeff Sessions, and pushing Mr. Sessions to reverse his recusal from the Russia inquiry; and potentially by dangling pardons to key defendants. Congress and the American people deserve to know the truth about the facts and circumstances of the president’s possibly obstructive acts. Obstruction of an investigation is not only criminal conduct, but also an affront to our system of government and the faith that the American people have in it.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>BEAUREGARD, Ala. — Days after ferocious tornadoes killed almost two dozen people and devastated block after block of eastern Alabama, officials warned Wednesday that the state should brace for the possibility of more trouble this weekend.

“We have another storm system, very powerful, that will begin entering the state” on Saturday, Kevin Laws, a National Weather Service meteorologist, said at a news conference in the county where 23 people were killed on Sunday. “Most of the entire state’s going to be under a significant risk.”

The Weather Service’s Storm Prediction Center issued a separate forecast that showed much of the South, including Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana and the Carolinas, in at least some jeopardy over the weekend. Meteorologists, who predicted Sunday’s outbreak with striking precision, are expected to refine their forecast in the coming days.

Mr. Laws said there was a possibility that the eastern half of Alabama, which includes the communities that were hit hardest last weekend, would ultimately face “somewhat more of a minimal risk.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The result is an anthology of loosely linked bits built on a shocking premise: What if at some point in the “beyond now,” in order to solve the problem of racism in America without whites having to do anything, the government offered all black citizens descended from slaves one-way airfare back to Africa? And what if almost all of them took up the offer?

Certainly Peaches plans to go; it’s a good deal with a lousy alternative. “If you stay here,” she says, “you only got two choices for guaranteed housing, and that’s either a cell or a coffin.”

[What’s new onstage and off: Sign up for our Theater Update newsletter]

As it turns out, Peaches is the sole check-in agent for African-American Airlines flight 1619. (The number isn’t random.) Dressed in a pink faux-alligator-skin suit, with a model airplane perched in her matching pink wig, she has the brilliant patter but not quite the patience to get the job done.

You might say the same of the play, which alternates between scenes with Peaches that are reliably effective and others, in various styles, that sometimes land and sometimes crash.

And sometimes soar. The first, set on Nov. 4, 2008, is an orgiastically over-the-top funeral for Brother “Righttocomplain” — an allegorical figure representing centuries of justifiable black grievance. (“He had many mothers and fathers, and too many children with too many mothers to even begin to count.”) With the election that night of President Barack Obama, and thus the end of “our suffering as people in this wretched land,” he is finally being laid to rest.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Santa Anita Park has suspended thoroughbred racing indefinitely after a spike of fatalities have cast doubt on the safety of its racing surface.

The action came late Tuesday after a 4-year-old filly, Lets Light the Way, was euthanized after sustaining a shattered sesamoid, a bone at the horse’s ankle joint. It was the 21st horse fatality suffered in racing or training at Santa Anita, considered one of horse racing’s premier showcases, since Dec. 26.

In a statement, Tim Ritvo, the chief operating officer of the Stronach Group, which owns Santa Anita, said he had “been in constant communication with the California Horse Racing Board and numerous key industry stakeholders, who are in full agreement with the decision to suspend racing and training.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>That basic premise recalls the Eisenhower-era horror classic “Invasion of the Body Snatchers,” which gratifyingly suggested that those who rule the status quo are really mindless pod people. At first Jeremy — the anxious son of a morose single Dad (Jason SweetTooth Williams) who mopes around the house in his underwear — is ecstatic just to fit in.

But like the leading characters of “Dear Evan Hansen” and “Mean Girls,” Jeremy learns that popularity comes at a dehumanizing price. His hour of reckoning takes place during a performance of a school play about a zombie apocalypse, during which he wrestles with his bad cyber angel.

He is assisted by his bestie, the forever gauche Michael Mell (the highly emotive George Salazar), whom Jeremy had abandoned on the road to social success. He is also inspired by selfless love — for the madcap Christine Canigula (a hyperkinetic Stephanie Hsu).

This all sounds like more fun than it is — at least for anyone over the age of 21. (That’s a generous cutoff point.) The acting, singing and dancing (choreographed by Chase Brock) are all, to put it kindly, frenetic. The set (by Beowulf Boritt), lighting (Tyler Micoleau) costumes (Bobby Frederick Tilley II) and projections (Alex Basco Koch) bring to mind bright fan fiction comic books drawn in fluorescent crayon.

Despite a lively production number that brings the classic “Telephone Hour” scene from “Bye Bye Birdie” into the present (as “The Smartphone Hour,” led by the powerhouse Tiffany Mann), the show’s cultural and technological frames of reference aren’t truly of the moment. Much of “Be More Chill” could have been staged in the late 20th century, when the first “Matrix” movie came out, without seeming out of place or even prescient.

But it may be its very lack of chillness that has allowed “Be More Chill” to capture so many young hearts. None of the characters on stage really look like enviably glamorous popular people, but friendly nebbishes imitating the social elite with slapdash satirical broad strokes.

The rhymes in Mr. Iconis’s lyrics feel like they might have been improvised on the spot by class-cutting stoners behind the gym. (An example from the showstopping “Michael in the Bathroom”: “I’d rather fake pee/Than stand awkwardly.”)

Doubtless much care and calculation has gone into remounting “Be More Chill.” But it still has the goofy karaoke quality of kids performing boisterously for other kids. It doesn’t try to dazzle its audience with glossy professionalism. For better or worse, this may be the only show on Broadway that a tween could see and think happily, “Hey, I could do that at home.”</TEXT>

He even laid out his explanation in a “Q. and A.” format, as though in an interview, with asides to imagine the reactions.

“I am sure the journalists will love that,” he wrote, after answering, “yes,” to his own question, “Were/are you a fascist?”

      <TEXT>Patients said they were denied care as soon as they appeared stable. One of the plaintiffs in the case said in a filing her son, who struggled with substance abuse, died after he was forced to leave a residential treatment facility when the insurer denied coverage.

“In our view, it’s a monumental win for mental health and substance abuse patients,” said D. Brian Hufford, an attorney with Zuckerman Spaeder, who, along with Psych-Appeal, a private law firm specializing in insurance coverage for mental health issues, is representing the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs are part of a class-action lawsuit against United Behavioral Health, and say they were covered under the United plans from 2011 to 2017 and denied care.

In the aftermath of the ruling, the company maintained that it had not failed to provide the proper care.

“We look forward to demonstrating in the next phase of this case how our members received appropriate care,” said UnitedHealth in an emailed statement. “We remain committed to providing our members with access to the right care for the treatment of mental health conditions and substance use disorders.”

Judge Spero is expected to reach a final judgment in the next few months.

The case represents the latest development in the contentious debate over how health insurance companies cover mental health and substance abuse disorders, as compared to medical conditions like diabetes, multiple sclerosis and asthma. In spite of the passage of a federal law, the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, patients have long complained about the difficulty of getting care covered, especially when they are in no immediate danger.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Alfre Woodard has been acting in movies and on television for 40 years, and she’s as vibrant and appealing as ever in “Juanita,” a late-in-life road movie/romance that has been constructed around the title character’s range and adventurousness. Adapted from Sheila Williams’s novel “Dancing on the Edge of the Roof,” the film stars Woodard as a middle-aged woman who follows a one-way Greyhound bus ticket from the Columbus, Ohio, projects to Montana, where she turns around a struggling diner and finds refuge (and love). But on a journey intended to liberate her, she worries about being tied down someplace else.

Netflix’s most prominent — and promising — film release in March brings together J.C. Chandor, the superb director of “All Is Lost” and “A Most Violent Year,” and Mark Boal, the screenwriter of “The Hurt Locker” and “Zero Dark Thirty,” for the story of an audacious heist that’s somewhere between greed and justice. Oscar Isaac, Ben Affleck, Charlie Hunnam, Pedro Pascal and Garrett Hedlund star as former Special Forces operatives who attempt to steal millions in cash from a South American drug cartel. The good news for them? The authorities won’t care about a cartel getting robbed. The bad news? The cartel definitely will.

With “The Thick of It,” “In the Loop” and “Veep,” Armando Iannucci firmly established himself as the most scabrous political satirist of the 21st century, but he goes back to the middle of the 20th for “The Death of Stalin,” which digs into the chaos and folly that follow the death of a tyrannical dictator. The operatives surrounding Joseph Stalin in 1953 turn out to be just the sort of inept, backbiting sycophants that populate Iannucci’s other comedies. What’s different about “The Death of Stalin,” beyond its sumptuous period trappings, is how well it captures the fear and paranoia that seized the Soviet Union during Stalin’s rule and threw the country into a period of uncertainty after his death.

Even by the hard-partying, substance-abusing, hotel-trashing standards of ’80s hair-metal outfits, the members of Mötley Crüe were notoriously rambunctious, turning world tours into grotesque bacchanals that occasionally veered into the dangerous and self-destructive. Their collaborative autobiography, “The Dirt: Confessions of the World’s Most Notorious Rock Band,” is a bracing read that chases stories of shocking indulgence with sobering notes about addiction and a deadly car crash. The Netflix adaptation was directed by Jeff Tremaine, the man responsible for the “Jackass” movies, which seems like the perfect match for this material. “Bohemian Rhapsody” this is not.

‘Kubo and the Two Strings’

Starts streaming: March 23

The Portland-based production house Laika has produced some of the most distinctive and sophisticated animated features of the last decade, using a 3-D stop-motion process to add tactility to odd little films like “Coraline,” “ParaNorman” and “The Boxtrolls.” Laika’s “Kubo and the Two Strings” enters the world of ancient Japan, where a boy wielding a lute-like instrument called a samisen tells stories out of dancing origami papers, but whose own life is destined to become the stuff of legend. His quest to stop the evil Moon King (Ralph Fiennes) is notably abstract for a mainstream family film, but it’s mitigated by kid-friendly team-ups like a talking monkey (Charlize Theron) and a human-insect hybrid (Matthew McConaughey).</TEXT>

      <TEXT>At the same time, he and prominent House Republicans have been loudly assailing H.R. 1, cranking the fear-mongering demagogy to the max. Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy went so far as to star in an overwrought attack video. Mr. McCarthy asserts that the provision restoring voting rights to felons is not only “dangerous, it’s unconstitutional;” he goes on to say that under the optional matching-fund system, in which political donations up to $200 would be matched 6-to-1 with public funds, the Democrats would send your tax dollars to pay for campaigns; and he warns that the bill would facilitate voter fraud by providing for automatic voter registration, which would make it more difficult to strike ineligible voters from the rolls. “So future voters might be underage, dead or illegal immigrants, or maybe even registered one, two or three times!”

No, no and no. There is nothing unconstitutional or inherently dangerous about re-enfranchising former prisoners. The new matching-funds system would be financed through fines levied on companies caught violating federal law. And the Brennan Center for Justice has found that automatic voter registration, already working swimmingly in several states, increases registration rates and improves the accuracy of voting rolls.

H.R. 1 would put an end to at least some of the vile voter suppression practices that Republicans have embraced in recent years. Which goes to the heart of the party’s opposition.

Well before President Trump erupted on the scene, Republicans made the calculation that, with demographics trending against them, their best strategy was to make voting harder rather than easier, particularly for certain nonwhite segments of the electorate. Across the nation, they have pursued voter restriction tactics with vigor. Any effort to expand access to the ballot box sets off alarm bells within the party.

This leaves Republicans in the peculiar position of arguing that weeding out corruption, reducing the influence of special interests and protecting voting rights are inherently Democratic values.

The For the People Act is far from perfect. For Democrats, it is arguably a grand values statement more than a practical legislative blueprint. Not even its most fervent supporters expect it to go anywhere without considerable adjustment. But McConnell and Co. aren’t interested in debating or improving the package. They want it dead.

There should be nothing partisan about a push to make the American political system more accessible and accountable to the American people. The public is increasingly hungry for reform, thanks in part to the continuing outrages of President Trump. Mr. McConnell may turn out to be right that the issue will cause lawmakers pain in the coming elections — just not in the way he expects.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso — Russia has been steadily expanding its military influence across Africa, alarming Western officials with increasing arms sales, security agreements and training programs for unstable countries or autocratic leaders.

In the Central African Republic, where a Russian has been installed as the president’s national security adviser, the government is selling mining rights for gold and diamonds at a fraction of their worth to hire trainers and buy arms from Moscow. Russia is seeking to ensconce itself on NATO’s southern flank by helping a former general in Libya fight for control over his government and vast oil market.

Sudan’s president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, brought in Russian mercenaries in January to help shore up his rule against nationwide protests. And last spring, five sub-Saharan African countries — Mali, Niger, Chad, Burkina Faso and Mauritania — appealed to Moscow to help their overtaxed militaries and security services combat the Islamic State and Al Qaeda.

Russia, entrenched in Africa during the Cold War’s violent East-West rivalry, largely retreated from the continent after the collapse of the Soviet Union. But in the past two years, Moscow has rekindled relations with Soviet-era clients like Mozambique and Angola, and forged new ties with other countries. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia will host a summit meeting between Moscow and African countries later this year.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>With Senator Rand Paul’s decision to support a resolution to block President Trump’s emergency declaration, Congress appears ready to deliver a stern rebuke to the president over his border wall and a clear statement that it will defend its ability to control federal spending.

Senator Paul, a libertarian-minded Kentuckian, said he will join fellow Republican Senators Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, giving proponents of the resolution of disapproval the 51 votes they need, if Democrats remain united in their support.

On Monday, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, confirmed that the measure has the votes to pass the Senate. Senate leadership, he said, has been conferring with the Senate parliamentarian to see if the House-passed resolution could be amended before the vote.

“It’s an interesting question,” Mr. McConnell said at a news conference in Kentucky. “It’s never been done before.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>In 1990, the choreographer Paul Taylor sent “pseudo death-threats” (his darkly teasing term) — each one a work of art — to five of New York’s foremost dance critics. The one that Deborah Jowitt received was a striking text collage: “Who saw her die? ‘I,’ said the fly, ‘with my little eye, I saw her die.’ Anon.”

Ms. Jowitt, 85, still has it hanging on her wall. She showed it to me recently when I visited the Greenwich Village apartment that she and her husband have lived in since 1969. It hangs alongside vintage posters of 19th-century Romantic ballet, of Twyla Tharp, and of the radical 1970s improvisatory group Grand Union.

Ms. Jowitt, who has been reviewing since 1964, has probably vexed fewer choreographers than most other leading critics. She speaks of Taylor tenderly (“a genius”), and with gratitude. As the subject of her first review for The Village Voice (Nov. 9, 1967), he immediately wrote her with advice: She should have more confidence in her own views and not quote a senior critic to prop herself up.

The letter ends: “If you believe I have ‘sold out’ then you must say so. If you think I would trade fine work for ‘success’ you are just plain crazy and I will spank you the next time I see you. All best wishes to you and your typewriter from me and mine, Paul.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Afghanistan: After the Islamic State bombed a wrestling club’s gym in western Kabul, killing more than two dozen athletes and wounding more than 90, wrestlers from around the world sent aid. The rebuilt gym is bigger, better and busier than ever.

The Mueller report: The highly anticipated findings of the special counsel’s investigation into Russian influence in the 2016 presidential election are expected any day now. Here’s what we know so far.

Google: European authorities fined the technology company about $1.7 billion for violating antitrust rules in the online advertising market. The punitive action is the region’s third against Google since 2017, reinforcing its position as the world’s most powerful watchdog of an industry that plays an increasingly powerful social and economic role.

Postpartum depression: U.S. drug regulators approved a new medication that effectively tackles depression during or after pregnancy. Brexanolone, which will be marketed as Zulresso, is delivered by infusion over several days and costs tens of thousands of dollars, but it will most likely pave the way for other treatments.

Space missions: Japan’s Hayabusa2 spacecraft has taken a sample from the Ryugu asteroid despite its unexpectedly rugged surface, while NASA’s Osiris-Rex has not yet succeeded in collecting anything (except near misses) from the Bennu asteroid, their teams reported.

Ricky Gervais: The British comedian is known for cringe-inducing comedy and “outsider” characters. His new Netflix show, “After Life,” is no exception. “Anything you do that’s the slightest bit interesting,” he said in an interview with our Talk columnist, “as many people are going to hate it as love it.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>As the Summer of Scam yielded to fall and now winter, we might come to realize, two Fyre Festival documentaries later, that we live in an era (or, indeed, a nation) of scam: We love stories about people with big dreams and minimal credentials, whether they succeed or fail. The truest American heroes are the people to whom Jessica Chiccehitto Hindman dedicates her new memoir, “Sounds Like Titanic”: “those with average talents and above-average desires.”

“Sounds Like Titanic” follows Hindman when, as a desperately broke senior at Columbia, she seems to catch a huge break. Despite her only musical training being lessons she took as a child in West Virginia, she is hired to play violin in an ensemble led by a composer who has sold thousands of albums and played at Lincoln Center. She realizes why his staff has overlooked her lack of skill when, onstage with the rest of the ensemble, a deafening CD track begins to play. It is what she calls a “Milli Violini” situation: The audience is in fact listening to a recording.

The book jumps between Hindman’s first gigs with the Composer (the only name she gives him), her Appalachian childhood and her travels with the Composer on his “God Bless America Tour” in 2004, when he played a series of concert benefits for PBS stations around the country. Hindman dedicates several sections to the Composer, but all we really learn about him is that he is both shrewd and stupid. He struck gold in the classical contemporary market by blatantly ripping off the “Titanic” soundtrack and taking a direct sales approach, hocking CDs at “live” performances at shopping centers and art fairs. In the end, he may be a true innocent, just like the American mall-goers who buy his CDs. When Hindman plays Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony on their tour bus, he says to her: “I like this music. What is it?”

As scams go, the Composer’s is relatively benign — playing to a backing track isn’t illegal — and “Sounds Like Titanic” is not ultimately interested in skewering or exposing him. It is more a memoir of millennial economic ennui, a clever illustration of navigating impostor syndrome and the gig economy, since Hindman literally takes gigs as an impostor violinist. She was a Middle Eastern studies major at Columbia and was studying abroad in Cairo on 9/11. She longs to be a foreign correspondent at a newspaper, but she finds her expertise works against her: “It will be more difficult to make a living by providing accurate information about the Middle East to an American audience than it will be to make a living by fake-playing the violin.”</TEXT>

      <TITLE>Sometimes Wiping Out Badgers Helped. Sometimes It Didn’t. Why? - The New York Times</TITLE>

      <TEXT>The badger is chubby but strong, with short legs, a long body and endearingly goofy gait. It has become a cultural icon to children who grew up reading “The Wind in the Willows,” or more recently, “Harry Potter,” in which the badger is the symbol of the Hufflepuffs. Once tortured by dogs in a blood sport called badger baiting, it is now a protected species in Britain.

But the beloved creatures also carry bovine tuberculosis, a disease that has killed hundreds of thousands of cows across Britain since at least the 1970s. For that reason, the omnivorous mustelids have been targeted in bloody culls to control the disease’s spread.

In some instances the effort worked; in others, it didn’t. All along, Britons who love badgers have questioned the effectiveness and necessity of the culls.

[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]

In a new study, researchers simulated different badger-culling scenarios, and discovered that culling can help reduce the spread of wildlife disease. But to work, the efforts must fall within a “Goldilocks zone,” wherein the number of animals killed, the ground covered and the duration of the cull all must be just right. The study’s results, published in Journal of the Royal Society Interface on Tuesday, help explain some of the mystery over the varied effectiveness of the culls, which has driven decades of dispute in Britain. The results also provide a framework for understanding culling efforts to stop the spread of wildlife diseases in other animals, and suggest that on-the-ground realities often make a successful cull unattainable.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Keeping the internet, or at the very least social media, free from vile content is grueling work. The experience of content moderators for Facebook raises troubling questions about the future of human moderation and the wider danger that online content poses to public health.

Repeated exposure to conspiracy theories — say, that the earth is flat or that the Holocaust didn’t happen — turns out to sway content moderators, an effect that may very well be playing out in the population at large. Repeated exposure to images of violence and sexual exploitation often leaves moderators with post-traumatic stress disorder. Moderators have reported crying on the job or sleeping with guns by their side. Turnover is high, pay is low, and although they have access to on-site counselors, many moderators develop symptoms of PTSD after leaving the job.

We don’t know if moderators are canaries for the social-media-consuming public at large or if their heavy dose of the worst of the web makes them outliers. Is repeated exposure to conspiracy theories — often given boosts by recommendation algorithms — swaying the general public, in some cases leading to public health emergencies like the measles outbreak? Is extremist propaganda fueling a surge in right-wing violence?

The killer in New Zealand sought to hijack the attention of the internet, and the millions of uploads of his video — both attempted and achieved — were a natural consequence of what the platforms are designed to promote in users: the desire to make content go viral.

In the midst of the crisis this weekend, YouTube resorted to temporarily disabling the ability to search recently uploaded videos. It’s not the first time a platform has disabled a function of its product in response to tragedy. In July, WhatsApp limited message forwarding in India in the wake of lynchings fueled by rumors spread by users of the service. The change became global in January in an effort to fight “misinformation and rumors.”

It’s telling that the platforms must make themselves less functional in the interests of public safety. What happened this weekend gives an inkling of how intractable the problem may be. Internet platforms have been designed to monopolize human attention by any means necessary, and the content moderation machine is a flimsy check on a system that strives to overcome all forms of friction. The best outcome for the public now may be that Big Tech limits its own usability and reach, even if that comes at the cost of some profitability. Unfortunately, it’s also the outcome least likely to happen.

Now that people have had a day to digest Michael Cohen’s testimony, it’s possible to put together a working list of questions that congressional investigators should pursue. These questions revolve mostly around Trump’s business dealings with Russia and his attempts to hide information from the public and from investigators.
• None What role did Allen Weisselberg, an executive at the Trump Organization, play in reimbursing Michael Cohen for hush payments made to a porn star who claimed to have had an affair with Trump? The answer could help clarify Trump’s role in making and covering up the payments.
• None Did Trump commit fraud by misrepresenting his wealth in documents provided to financial firms? Both Weisselberg’s testimony and Trump’s tax returns could shed light.
• None “Was there Russian money coming into the Trump Organization or into Mr. Trump’s personal finances, and was he inflating the numbers [to] get loans?” in the words of Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat. That is, did the Russians have leverage over Trump in 2016?
• None Did Donald Trump Jr. lie to Congress in 2017 about Trump’s business ventures in Russia? And what role did he play in the hush-money payments to Stormy Daniels, the porn star with whom Trump allegedly had an affair?
• None Did Jay Sekulow, a Trump lawyer, and Abbe Lowell, who represents Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, review and edit Cohen’s false testimony about Trump’s business dealings in Russia? Cohen claimed so on Wednesday, and Sekulow has denied it. Lowell has not commented.
• None Can Rhona Graff, Trump’s longtime secretary, confirm Cohen’s allegation that Roger Stone called Trump in 2016 to discuss WikiLeaks-hacked Democratic emails?
• None Did Donald Trump Jr. confer with his father about the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with several Russians? If so, did the president commit perjury by reportedly claiming otherwise in written answers to the special counsel Robert Mueller?
• None Did Trump use his now-defunct charitable foundation to avoid paying taxes?
• None Did Trump lie about his taxes being under audit as an excuse to avoid releasing his tax returns?
• None What does Felix Sater, a Russia-born former business associate of Trump’s who was part of talks to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, know about Trump’s business dealings in Russia?
• None And beyond Cohen’s testimony: What do Trump’s tax returns show about his activities in Russia? What other potential crimes are prosecutors — either in New York or at the Justice Department — investigating?

[Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.]

How to get answers

The key next steps for the House include: demanding Trump’s tax returns; serving subpoenas to people whom Cohen mentioned in his testimony; serving subpoenas to obtain documents that can clear up any of the above; and, of course, following up on any new questions raised by the Mueller report.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The military and many airports nationwide have relied on PFAS-based firefighting spray because it can more quickly put out liquid fuel fires and it works when mixed with both fresh water and seawater.

The Defense Department has been moving in recent years to phase out the use of the most worrisome version of these chemicals and replace them with a formulation that does not break down in the environment as easily or build up as much in the bloodstream if it ends up in drinking water. But this replacement chemical is also generating health concerns.

The E.P.A. — after intense criticism from communities facing contaminated water, as well as from both Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill — is moving toward creating two new PFAS standards to address the problem nationwide.

The first would establish guidelines for when cleanups will be required at federally controlled sites to try to prevent that contamination from reaching drinking water supplies.

The second would set a legally binding, maximum allowable drinking water level for PFOS and PFOA, two of the most common forms of PFAS. Separately, the E.P.A. is preparing to designate these chemicals hazardous substances, meaning areas contaminated can be designated Superfund sites, formalizing the cleanup effort.

The E.P.A. completed its work on the first step, the proposed groundwater cleanup standard, last August, and transferred it to the White House Office of Management and Budget for approval, with a prediction that it would be finalized and made public by last fall.

But federal officials briefed on the negotiations, including the office of Senator Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware, the ranking member of the Senate committee that oversees the E.P.A., said major objections were raised by the Pentagon, as well as by NASA, another major user of PFAS, and the Small Business Administration.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Robert De Niro, the most famous co-founder of the Tribeca Film Festival, will sit down with his frequent collaborator Martin Scorsese during this year’s Tribeca Talks series, the festival announced Tuesday.

De Niro has appeared in nine films directed by Scorsese, including “Taxi Driver” and “Goodfellas.” They will reunite in another crime drama — “The Irishman” — this fall.

The series will bring together other collaborative duos, like the director David O. Russell and the actress Jennifer Lawrence, who have worked together on “Silver Linings Playbook,” “American Hustle” and “Joy.” The actress and rapper Queen Latifah will also make an appearance alongside the director Dee Rees in a conversation ahead of the premiere of two short documentaries by the Queen Collective, a program Queen Latifah helped develop to amplify gender and racial equality in filmmaking.

Other notable stars featured in the series include Guillermo Del Toro, Sarah Silverman and Michael J. Fox. This year’s festival runs April 24-May 5. For more information, go to tribecafilm.com.</TEXT>

The No. 6 Spartans perked up when Ahrens returned courtside as a spectator, and they rallied to defeat No. 10 Michigan, 65-60, on Sunday in Chicago.

Matt McQuaid scored a career-high 27 points, and Cassius Winston converted the go-ahead layup in the closing minute for Michigan State (28-6), which came back from a 13-point deficit in the second half and scored the game’s final 10 points.

Ahrens, averaging 4.8 points a game, said he was relieved X-rays showed the ankle was not broken, but the extent of the injury was not clear.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>SYDNEY, Australia — An oil spill from a cargo ship that ran aground near a World Heritage site in the South Pacific is spreading, alarming environmentalists and government officials about the threat to the delicate local ecosystem and to people living there.

The Hong Kong-flagged ship, Solomon Trader, was carrying more than 770 tons of heavy fuel oil when it ran aground last month on Rennell Island, one of the Solomon Islands, which Unesco says is the largest raised coral atoll in the world. The ship is leaking just outside the boundaries of the World Heritage site, called East Rennell.

Officials in Australia, which has a close relationship with the Solomon Islands, said this week that oil had spread along more than three miles of coastline and into the surrounding sea, and that it was approaching the boundaries of the heritage site. The source of the leak has yet to be found.

Australia initially sent experts to help monitor the spill, but Foreign Minister Marise Payne said on Sunday that the country would step up efforts and send equipment, vessels and experts to help contain the damage to Rennell Island, which is home to animal species found nowhere else.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Second Stage Theater will present new plays by Tracy Letts and Bess Wohl and a revival of Richard Greenberg’s baseball comedy “Take Me Out” on Broadway in the 2019-20 season.

“Linda Vista,” Mr. Letts’s look at midlife malaise, will begin performances at the Hayes Theater on Sept. 19. The Steppenwolf Theater Company production, presented in association with Center Theater Group, will be directed by Dexter Bullard. It will be Mr. Letts’s third play on Broadway, following his Pulitzer Prize-winning “August: Osage County” and “Superior Donuts.” (As an actor, he’s about to star in Arthur Miller’s “All My Sons” next month.)

Ms. Wohl’s “Grand Horizons,” which will have its world premiere at the Williamstown Theater Festival this summer, will begin performances at the Hayes in December, with Leigh Silverman directing. Ms. Wohl, best known for the silent-retreat comedy “Small Mouth Sounds,” is making her Broadway debut with the play, about a long marriage coming apart.

“Take Me Out,” which imagined the repercussions of a major-league baseball player coming out of the closet, will return to Broadway in the spring for the first time since its 2003 premiere. Scott Ellis will direct.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Rights groups have reported that some of the women were subjected to torture and other physical and psychological abuse in jail. During a court hearing on Wednesday, several of the women told a three-judge panel that they had been tortured and sexually harassed by their captors, said Yahya Assiri, the director of ALQST. One, Shadan al-Anezi, told the court that her interrogators had used drugs such as hash while abusing her, Mr. Assiri said.

Though 11 women are on trial, at least two more have been detained without charges, activists said. The government has denied that any defendants have been mistreated.

Mr. Assiri said he believed that the authorities had allowed the women to be released because they were “under international pressure,” and that the charges would eventually be dropped. “But we can’t trust that, so the pressure must continue to make sure they’re completely free,” he said.

The women’s arrests preceded the much-publicized lifting of a ban on driving by women in Saudi Arabia, just one of many restrictions opposed by the activists. They were also advocates for the rights of domestic violence victims, and urged the kingdom’s leaders to dismantle Saudi Arabia’s guardianship system, which requires women to obtain permission from a male guardian, such as a husband, father, brother or son, to study, work and travel.

The women’s activism came amid a harsh crackdown on dissent orchestrated by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who was consolidating power by moving against critics and potential rivals. Though the crown prince has moved to expand some freedoms for women, some have interpreted the arrest of the activists as a message from the prince: Change comes from above, not below.

The crown prince’s human rights record drew global attention in October with the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi citizen and critic of the government who lived in the United States and wrote columns for The Washington Post. Saudi agents killed Mr. Khashoggi inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, and the intelligence agencies of the United States and some of its allies have concluded that Prince Mohammed ordered his death.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Later this year, NASA will reveal never-before-seen morsels of the moon, the agency announced on Monday.

The astronauts of the Apollo missions that landed on the moon from 1969 to 1972 collected 842 pounds worth of lunar rocks, core samples, pebbles, sand and dust. Many of those samples were later opened on the ground. But three have remained sealed — their contents stashed away for nearly 50 years.

They were intentionally saved for a time when more advanced technology would allow planetary scientists on Earth to delve deeper into the moon’s mysteries.

“The technology available in the ’60s and ’70s wasn’t able to do what we can do now,” said Jessica Barnes, an astronomer soon to join the University of Arizona’s Lunar and Planetary Laboratory. “Now we can go to a mineral and we can look at the very fine details, down to almost the width of a human hair.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>JOHANNESBURG — A high-ranking politician in South Africa’s governing African National Congress was arrested in connection with the assassination of a party member who had exposed corruption in a public works project, officials said Monday.

Mluleki Ndobe, one of the most influential A.N.C. power brokers in KwaZulu-Natal Province, was arrested early Sunday for suspected involvement in the mafia-style killing of a nationally known party leader, Sindiso Magaqa, according to party and police officials.

Mr. Magaqa, who had loudly condemned the theft of public money in the town of Umzimkhulu, was fatally shot inside his Mercedes-Benz in 2017 by two hit men who sprayed the car with gunfire. A man suspected of being one of the killers was arrested in September.

The assassination — the most high-profile in a wave of political killings that have swept across South Africa since early 2016 — came to symbolize the decline of the A.N.C., whose members have increasingly targeted anticorruption whistle-blowers and turned on one another in lethal fights over political posts.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“It is a particularly great honor to receive the Angus McDougall award since, more than any other honor, it recognizes the value of teamwork and the many talented editors and photographers who contribute to our visual report,” said Meaghan Looram, The Times’s director of photography. “I believe our portfolio this year highlighted the broad variety of photography that our staff and freelance contributors are creating, and the versatility and ingenuity of our photo editors and our print and digital design colleagues who are devoted to presenting our visual journalism to our readers in the most powerful formats for every medium.”

Ms. Phelps grew up in a mostly rural and conservative area outside of Newark, Ohio. From an early age she wanted nothing more than to leave: After studying photography at the Columbus College of Art and Design, she spent two years living on a goat farm in Italy, then spent time in Chile, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. After turning her attention to photojournalism — and running out of money — she made her way back home. Now at The Advocate for six years, she has learned to appreciate her hometown.

“I understand the supportive nature of my community and that everyone is there for everyone else when somebody is in need,” she said. “I came back to it with both the eyes of an outsider and somebody who grew up there. I now understand that people are just living their lives doing the best they can and that we’re all human.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Spencer Dinwiddie scored 23 points, Jarrett Allen added 20 points and 12 rebounds, and the Nets held off the host Atlanta Hawks, 114-112, on Saturday night for their third straight win.

The Nets moved into a tie with the Detroit Pistons for sixth place in the Eastern Conference despite missing 21 free throws to give the Hawks a chance at the end. After Joe Harris hit one of two foul shots with 16.3 seconds remaining, Trae Young dribbled down the clock and passed to 42-year-old Vince Carter, who missed a 3-point attempt at the buzzer.

“Honestly, we just got enough stops, just barely enough stops,” Dinwiddie said. “We gave up a lot and we missed a lot of free throws that made it harder on ourselves than it really needed to be.”

John Collins finished with 33 points and a career-high 20 rebounds for Atlanta, and Young had 23 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>What cast a pall over this year’s celebration was President Ghani’s decision last week to fire the local police chief, a protégé of Mr. Noor, and replace him with his own candidate. Mr. Noor’s armed supporters and the local police resisted, but Mr. Ghani sent in Special Forces troops to take over the police headquarters. A brief spasm of fighting killed one policeman and wounded 20 others, mostly civilians, and Mr. Ghani had his way.

Afghan Army troops remain on the streets, blocking vehicles’ access to the Blue Mosque and searching everyone who enters. Mr. Noor has vowed to take action, saying that the police chief’s appointment violates an agreement with Mr. Ghani that Mr. Noor would be consulted on such moves.

During Nowruz festivities, nearly every home is filled to bursting with guests from other parts of the country. Nasratullah Qarizada, a dress importer in Kabul, the capital, who is from Mazar, said he had many fewer guests this year — but there were still around 40 people.

The fear of violence diminished, but did not stop, the party. The streets were filled with revelers, even as shopkeepers complained they were not as numerous as in past years. Small crowds gathered wherever an egg-fighting match took place: a game with obscure rules in which hard-boiled eggs are bashed against one another to see whose egg is toughest. Warplanes flew overhead, firing off chaff with embedded fairy lights.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I almost swiped past it. “Dating Around,” Netflix’s latest reality show, is based on an unremarkable premise: In each episode, “one real-life single navigates five blind dates,” in search of “one match worthy of a second date.” This is the kind of conceptual void that reality television producers typically pad with gimmicks. They make their daters go bikini skiing, or mud wrestle their romantic rivals, or kiss in old-age makeup. But on “Dating Around,” two strangers just get together for dinner and drinks, and this scenario supplies all of the necessary drama. It is the rare dating show that takes dating seriously.

That is a pleasant surprise. Previous iterations of the multiple-blind-date format — early aughts offerings like “Next,” “Dismissed” and “ElimiDate” — subsisted on canned one-liners and bitter judgments. The camera always seemed to be looking down on everyone. Even “The Bachelor,” which styles itself as so hopelessly romantic that each season is designed to culminate in an engagement, is a fundamentally cynical exercise. But by lowering the stakes about as far as they can go, “Dating Around” has managed to dial up the excitement and possibility of the dreaded first-date experience.

The six episodes of “Dating Around” are named for their central singletons — Luke, Gurki, Lex, Leonard, Sarah and Mila — and the show handles them delicately, bathing them in low light and summoning close friends to introduce them via voice-over. Reality dating shows often draw from the aesthetics of beauty contests and sports, but this one is produced like prestige television, filming dates as if they were scenes between character actors.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Oleg watches Ivan for about a month and a half. And then, one day, he gets a text message written in Russian. It’s cryptic, but he knows what it means. It says, [SPEAKING RUSSIAN], which means, “The rose must be picked today. Tomorrow, it is no longer relevant.” At that point, Oleg positions himself on the sixth floor in the hallway outside of Ivan’s apartment and waits for him to come home. He stands there, I’m not exactly sure for how long, smoking cigarettes, with a gun in his hand, a silenced pistol. And when the elevator doors open, he calls Ivan’s name. Ivan turns to him, and Oleg opens fire. He shoots him eight times. But instead of falling to the ground immediately, Ivan turns and walks towards Oleg and says, in Russian, [SPEAKING RUSSIAN], which means, “It’s not me. I’m not guilty.” And then, he falls dead to the floor.

Even with my digging, we don’t know a lot. We know that all of them had some connection to the Georgian war. But it was really hard to find anything, specifically, about their involvement. One I found on a government document. Several I found named in books about the war that were written by Russian authors. One of the men on the list I met, and he claimed to have been in Georgia during this time but didn’t even take part in the war. And so what is clear is that these people don’t appear to have played a very big role, if any, in the fighting. And there’s no evidence to suggest that they had anything to do with these missile systems that shot down Russian planes. That includes Ivan Mamchur, the man who was killed. It had been eight years since the war in Georgia. He was doing nothing that would seem to constitute a threat to Russia. But for some reason, they came after him, and they killed him.

Correct. Russia will remember. The Kremlin will remember. And in a lot of cases, they come after you. If you look at Skripal, and if you look at Mamchur, and if you look at any number of people that we believe have been murdered by the Russian state, these killings, these attacks, seem to serve no geopolitical purpose. They are individual, petty slights that the Kremlin is pursuing, that the Kremlin is seeking satisfaction for. And that’s what sets Russia apart from other countries. It operates more like a mafia organization, an organized crime syndicate, than it does a state. It almost, often, seems as if it’s Putin’s personal animosities that are driving these attacks and driving these killings. But the one thing that’s interesting and even, perhaps, more scary about this case is that not only is the target insignificant, but the assassin is a nobody. I think there’s this assumption about Russian spies, that they’re the elites. They’re highly trained. Russia has one of the most well-funded, most populous spy services in the world. And yet, Oleg was a criminal. He was untrained. He was not an intelligence officer, based upon everything that we know. And that, to me, is probably more terrifying than anything else.</TEXT>

      <TITLE>Opinion | Not All Medicare Cuts Are Bad - The New York Times</TITLE>

      <TEXT>Hospitals understandably dislike these proposals, and there may well be a better dividing line. It’s also possible that in some cases, the federal government should pay higher fees to private practices rather than pay lower fees to hospital affiliates. The administration’s budget contains only a thumbnail sketch of its own ideas, and the details clearly matter.

But Democrats are not debating the details. Instead, a proposal to improve the efficiency of health care spending is being treated as an attack on the availability of health care.

This is not a new phenomenon, of course. The Affordable Care Act included substantial reductions in Medicare spending. Those cuts, like Mr. Trump’s proposals, came mostly at the expense of providers rather than patients. But Republicans chose to attack the changes in language strikingly similar to the language Democrats have used in recent weeks.

Both parties have fallen into the unfortunate habit of characterizing every proposal to reduce Medicare spending as an attack on the program’s beneficiaries. In fact, careful stewardship of spending is necessary to ensure the program can help as many people as possible.

Mr. Trump is guilty of contradicting his campaign promise that he would not seek to cut Medicare spending. But it is the promise that was irresponsible, not the budget proposal.

Some items on Mr. Trump’s list of proposed savings have obvious downsides. For example, he has proposed to cut federal spending by increasing the annual amount that several hundred thousand Medicare beneficiaries are required to pay for needed medications. The budget also proposes large cuts in Medicaid that would reduce the availability of health care for many lower-income and disabled Americans.

But a president’s budget is just a list of ideas. It's up to Congress to pick the good ones.

Support for past cuts in Medicare spending was driven in part by concerns about the growth of the federal debt. Both parties lately have taken a more relaxed view of the government’s borrowing capacity, in part because apocalyptic predictions about the current level of federal debt look rather silly in retrospect. But the government’s ability to borrow money is not a justification for the wasteful spending of tax dollars.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>It was President Barack Obama who started funding Myanmar’s anti-narcotics agency. The agency operates under Myanmar’s armed forces, which are notorious for torturing dissidents and ethnic cleansing. This army also created and oversees militias that are major players in the behemoth meth business.

While one tentacle of Myanmar’s security apparatus traffics pink meth pills, another receives millions of American tax dollars to fight the spread of those very drugs.

In its most recent budget, Congress re-upped Myanmar’s annual anti-narcotics funding with a fresh $3 million. This amount, while small, confers legitimacy that Myanmar badly craves, especially since some of the country’s top generals face accusations by the United Nations of genocide against Rohingya Muslims.

If this is the best Washington can offer, then doing nothing would be better. We should stop funding, training and equipping anti-narcotics operations in Southeast Asia that increase incarceration and death.

Just a few days after that man was kidnapped in Myanmar, I returned to Pat Jasan’s command center to check on him. He was out of the stocks, up and about, nodding along to a lecture from the Baptists.

They ordered him to ritually burn his plastic meth bong on an altar. As it turned liquid in the flames, the man’s captors held his hand and prayed for his salvation.

Then they sent him back to his farmhouse with a sore back. The man never deserved to be kidnapped and tormented. But that punishment sure beats wasting years in a sweltering cell in Thailand or, worse yet, getting shot dead by cops in the Philippines.

      <TEXT>Jimmy Vesey scored the go-ahead goal early in the third period, helping the Rangers beat the Blues, 4-2, on Friday night at Madison Square Garden.

Ryan Strome, Pavel Buchnevich and Chris Kreider also scored, and Alexandar Georgiev made 44 saves for the Rangers, who had lost two in a row.

Vesey found a loose puck during a scramble in front at 5 minutes 17 seconds of the third to break a 2-2 tie. It was his first goal since Feb. 27.

“Regardless of the situation, everything feels better when you are winning, the mood is light and everyone is having fun,” Vesey said after the Rangers’ first regulation win since March 9. “I don’t think that’s the prettiest game we have played all year, but that’s a good team and will take the win.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>HERAT, Afghanistan — Taliban fighters killed or captured an entire Afghan National Army company of more than 50 soldiers on Monday, Afghan officials said, the latest in a series of major attacks by the militant group even as it pursues a peace deal with the United States.

The attack, in which the Taliban were reported to have killed 16 soldiers and taken 40 prisoner, took place in northwestern Badghis Province, close to the country’s western border with Turkmenistan. It came as Taliban negotiators entered a third week of talks with American diplomats in the Persian Gulf kingdom of Qatar.

In the assault, a large force of Taliban insurgents surrounded a base in the Bala Murghab district. After four hours of fighting, the militants captured or killed all of the soldiers in their base, as well as others at two outposts nearby, according to Abdul Aziz Beg, head of the Badghis provincial council.

The episode was the deadliest in a weeklong insurgent campaign that has killed, wounded or captured 70 soldiers in the district, Mr. Beg said. “The district is on the verge of collapse,” Mr. Beg said. “The fighting has gone on for a week, but the government is not paying any attention.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The news that just seven black students were offered admission to Stuyvesant High School, the most celebrated public school in New York City, is an embarrassment.

It should also be a call to action for state lawmakers, who hold the power to change an admissions process that shuts out black and Latino students from New York City’s eight selective specialized high schools, which can provide a crucial path to success.

The major reason is a state law known as the Hecht-Calandra Act that requires the three largest schools — Stuyvesant, the Bronx High School of Science and Brooklyn Technical High School — to use a single exam as the sole criterion for admission. That law was passed in 1971, as the city weighed measures to increase enrollment of black and Hispanic students at the schools amid a broad push for racial integration. Whatever the law’s original intent, the effect has been to limit the number of black and Latino students.

It has also spawned a cottage industry in which parents — including Asian New Yorkers living in poverty — feel compelled to spend thousands of dollars on test preparation over several years to give their children a shot at one of these coveted seats. Other students have little chance to compete.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>For much of music history, songs were accompanied by an instrument that could act as a foil to the human voice. In recent decades electronics have often taken the place of the lute or piano, with dramatic effects. When the taped sounds contains snippets of the voice itself — recorded either beforehand or sampled live in performance — the distinction between song and accompaniment dissolves.

But there’s also a risk that this dialogue with technology becomes little more than an echo chamber, too insular and self-validating. On Thursday at the DiMenna Center, the New York Festival of Song presented an evening of works for voice and electronics that sometimes felt sterile and self-absorbed.

The program was designed by the composer and vocalist Kate Soper and opened with her performing her own “The Understanding of All Things.” The text is by Kafka and imagines a philosopher who snatches spinning tops from playing children in an attempt to understand reality. Ms. Soper’s setting takes a dryly literal approach, with recorded sounds of a spinning top mixing with scrambled phrases and her own live, fragmented, recitation. The attentive sound artist here and throughout the evening was Sam Pluta.

Electronics can blur the border between human and machine-made sounds in a way that allows artists to play on themes like alienation, objectification and the splintering of the self. The composer Natacha Diels’s “Bahnhof” was a twist on the ancient myth of Philomela, the abused woman who, deprived of speech, turns into a nightingale.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>LONDON — What kind of story ballet can be created in the 21st century?

The narrative genre, exemplified by “Swan Lake,” “Giselle” and other 19th-century works, remains enduringly popular, its legacy extending to 20th-century ballets like Frederick Ashton’s “La Fille Mal Gardée” and Kenneth MacMillan’s “Manon.” Despite the influence of George Balanchine’s often plotless, neo-Classical works on late-20th-century ballet, audiences still seem hungry for stories. Arguably, ballet directors are even hungrier, constantly on the hunt for a new, lush narrative that they hope will draw audiences.

Enter “Victoria,” a new work by Cathy Marston for the Northern Ballet, based in Leeds. Ms. Marston, a British choreographer, has had a solid career since the late 1990s, but shot into prominence this year. She showed a liking for narrative work early on. Her first full-length ballet was based on Ibsen’s “Ghosts” (2005); her “Jane Eyre” (2016), also for Northern Ballet, will be performed by American Ballet Theater in June.

Unlike these pieces, “Victoria,” which opened at Sadler’s Wells on Tuesday, is based on historical accounts rather than a literary narrative, but Ms. Marston hasn’t found a convincing way to pull us in and make us care about the fate of its characters. Its structure is episodic, recounting parts of the life of Queen Victoria (Abigail Prudames) through the eyes and memories of her youngest daughter, Beatrice (Pippa Moore), who was entrusted with transcribing and editing the 122 volumes of her mother’s diaries after the queen’s death.

“Victoria” is carefully wrought, well danced and cleverly designed, with a serviceable cinematic score by Philip Feeney. It achieves a nice balance between period historicity and a contemporary perspective; Ms. Marston, and her dramaturge Uzma Hameed, never let us forget that we are looking at the past by providing an abstract, simply dressed chorus embodying the court and the populace.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Ms. Margolin, a founding member of the feminist company Split Britches and an accomplished writer and performer, especially of solo works (“8 Stops,” “O Yes I Will”), has long been interested in exploring Jewish identity. It is at the center of this piece, which culminates in a scene where Galkin binds the profane Madoff’s arm with tefillin (boxes containing scripture that are strapped to the arm and forehead during prayer).

The conceit is that the Madoff character (Jeremiah Kissel) is recalling from prison a conversation in which Galkin (Gerry Bamman) devoted hours and generous pours of Scotch to persuading Madoff to handle his savings (he was already managing the synagogue’s finances). Both men are tethered to real events, but with enough slack to let Ms. Margolin embark on flights of fancy, as when she daringly follows Galkin’s reading from a biblical commentary with Madoff’s memory of a rather telling episode: “I dreamed my penis was a vagina,” he says, “and it was a vagina that had folds. Really, it looked like a wallet.” Freud would be proud.

Throughout, Ms. Margolin pits a concentration-camp survivor who somehow remains almost naïvely hopeful against an amoral, greedy cynic with a fundamentally materialist view, and uses that contrast to explore issues of morality, trust, faith and guilt.

Remorse also factors in, albeit in a way that does not let anybody off the hook. At regular intervals, for instance, the men’s discussion is interrupted by a secretary (Jenny Allen), who pleads ignorance in her court testimony. “I should have known, I had no idea,” she says plaintively of Madoff’s colossal scam. By way of minimizing his misdeeds and, thus, her own, she points out, “It’s not like he murdered people!”

This Madoff is forcefully rendered by Mr. Kissel as a brash, vulgar and possibly insecure man, yet he yields little insight into why he did what he did. Fleetingly, he flirts with the idea of telling Galkin the truth, not to save him but to crush his “picture of the world as a place where some men are purely moral.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>But just cleaning the house and decluttering space for the Lunar New Year is not good enough. Feng shui experts say energies and directions change yearly, making it important to get your home’s design in tune with the Year of the Yin Earth Pig, which started on Feb. 5 and runs until Jan. 24, 2020.

David Cho, the feng shui consultant based in California who re-evaluates Ms. Martini’s home every year, said he also evaluates about 1,000 properties a year worldwide, the majority of which are owned by non-Asian clients. He’s currently working on a resort in Costa Rica, a townhouse in Manhattan, a castle in Ireland and factories in Saudi Arabia. (Consultants may charge either by property size or by the hour, with fees often starting at $400.)

“Feng shui is not a one-size-fits-all thing,” Mr. Cho said. “I calculate a structure’s shape, magnetic direction and factor in the year built. The client’s relationship to a home is then determined by his or her gender and date of birth.”

If you want to try some feng shui for yourself, Mr. Cho’s tips for this year include:

■ To maintain good health, accessorize the northeast area of your home with metal objects.

■ To expedite the completion of a project, add metal objects to the southwest area of your home. If your bedroom is in the southwest, and you can’t move it, put 25 pounds of metal under the bed.

■ If you’re looking for love, and your Chinese animal sign is a:

Rat, dragon or monkey, place a water fountain on the center of the bedroom’s west wall.

Ox, snake or rooster, place it on the center of the bedroom’s south wall.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Amnesty International called on the police to drop the charges.

“This is a blatant and ludicrous attempt to intimidate and silence Robertus for his peaceful criticism of the military,” Mr. Usman said. “He is an academic who is guilty of nothing more than voicing his views over proposals to place senior military officers in positions of power within the government.”

The case against Ms. Saidah and the four WhatsApp messages dates to 2017.

The brief messages were sent using a SIM card that had been registered in her name. Sent to local bankers, they questioned the credibility of the company, PT Pisma Putra Textile, that had long employed Ms. Saidah’s husband, Aziz Hamedan, who retired as the company’s finance director in 2016.

The company, which manufactures sarongs, complained to the police that the messages were insulting. Officers questioned Ms. Saidah and Mr. Aziz. Both denied sending the messages.

Ms. Saidah said she had lost her phone and canceled her cellphone number before the messages were sent.

The police and prosecution were unable to find the phone or establish who possessed the SIM card at the time.

The defense argued that she could not have been responsible since she does not speak Javanese, the language used in the messages.

Nevertheless, on Feb. 26, the court found her guilty of defamation and sentenced her to 10 months in jail.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>While your editorial board and the Trump administration may not always see eye to eye, this editorial finds important areas of agreement.

The president’s 2020 budget takes thoughtful steps to strengthen and protect the Medicare program for America’s seniors. In fact, the budget does not harm beneficiaries. It does not cut their benefits, nor does it increase aggregate out-of-pocket spending.

Instead, the budget eliminates waste and inefficiencies in the Medicare program, in line with the president’s campaign promise. One prominent example cited in the editorial is our push toward site-neutral payment. Why should taxpayers or seniors pay higher rates for a service at an outpatient hospital clinic than for the same service at a doctor’s office?

For example, seniors pay about $34 for a clinic visit at an outpatient hospital and about $15 for the same services at a physician’s office. This push is not a one-off occurrence; rather, it is something we have worked to embed in the system through the yearly payment process over the last two years.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Mr. Alpers said the challenge for New Zealand would mainly be getting the ammunition and guns that already exist out of circulation. Half of Australia’s states had some kind of gun registration plan in place before the 1996 reforms, making it easier for the authorities to know what weapons were out there and what needed to be brought in.

New Zealand only registers 4 percent of its weapons. According to the police, about 250,000 people in the country own an estimated 1.2 million to 1.5 million firearms. It is unclear how many of them would be affected by the ban.

“New Zealand is at a considerable disadvantage to countries that have had registries, because there’s no way of tracing the firearms because they don’t know who’s got them,” Mr. Alpers said. “We’re relying entirely on the honesty of the gun owner to turn it in.”

Ms. Ardern said that fair compensation would be paid to all those who participate.

Noting that there would be some limited exceptions for specific purposes, especially in rural areas, she said she expected the new law to be in place by April 11, the end of Parliament’s next session.

In the interim, as of Thursday afternoon, a change in regulations would alter the licensing rules for the weapons that would eventually be banned. To avoid a rush on purchases, weapons that now require a basic A Class license will fall under an E Class gun license, which is already much harder to obtain, and which the prime minister said would now be impossible to get.

“I can assure people there is no point in applying for such a permit,” she said.

      <TEXT>28A: I’d never heard of “the Armenian,” although the clue’s popped up a few times. If you think technology and modern times are accelerating beyond belief, check out the seven years of the leadership of LEO V. A cursory glance makes me think this must have been a show at some point, or it’s bound to be one day.

32A: You could read this clue as moving 24 inches from someone, or as moving your two feet in different directions, which is closer to the truth, since if you get your own two feet enough apart then you DO THE SPLITS, or at least tweak a hamstring. I could see this clue being one of several involving gymnastics, or measurement puns, or even relationship endings, in a theme puzzle.

54A: “Ephemeral” is a very poetic word, and for a gardener or outdoorsperson refers to a particularly fleeting group of wildflowers that pop up, often en masse, and vanish soon thereafter, displaying one form of TRANSIENCE. I noodled over this one a bit because I think of the two words so differently, sort of spiritual (here one minute, gone the next) vs. material (moving from place to place).

2D: “Fancy” isn’t used much as a verb these days, is it? Maybe when spring rolls around again; in this puzzle, its opposite is LOATHE, as in “I loathe these small ice squalls we keep getting, but things could be worse.”

8D: There aren’t multiple Moses(es), which is where my mind went; OBOES makes perfect sense and I loved the proximity here to OBIE.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Federal authorities investigating Russian interference in the presidential election obtained search warrants for emails of Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s former lawyer and fixer, beginning in July 2017, according to documents released Tuesday that provided a glimpse into the earliest stages of the inquiry into the president.

The documents show that by the time F.B.I. agents conducted a highly public raid on Mr. Cohen’s home and office in April of last year, his business dealings had already been the subject of an extensive investigation. 



The records, including search warrants and other materials related to the April raid, were among nearly 900 pages of documents that a federal judge unsealed in response to a request by The New York Times and other news organizations.

The records were heavily redacted. More than 150 pages were fully blacked out, and many had names or portions of the material obscured, mostly because they were related to the continuing investigation of the Trump Organization.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Love stories on “Game of Thrones” tend to end rather badly — your lover dying in your arms, or pushing you through the Moon Door, or strangling you with a golden chain. We talked to actor Sibel Kekilli about the sad standoff between Tyrion and Shae in Season 4. (Adapted from an earlier interview with Kekilli.)

How did you find out about your character’s death?

Dan Weiss and David Benioff told me that my role would be slightly different from the original character in the books, a bit bigger. But as I hadn’t read the books at that point, I had no clue exactly what they meant. When I told some friends that I was going to be in the show, they spoiled the whole thing for me, big-time. I actually thought they were going to kill me off at the end of Season 3, so after reading the scripts for that season, I asked Dan and David if they had changed their minds and decided to put Shae on the throne at the end? Unfortunately, their answer was no. But they gave me the good news that my character would live for one more season. So at least that was a nice surprise.

What do you remember from your last day on set?

My last day on set was actually the strangulation scene with Peter Dinklage, and I was rather sad that my time on “Game of Thrones” had come to its end. But I thought it was really kind that Dan and David came over from another set to watch me die.

Did you read any of the fan reaction?

Unfortunately, I did once. Apparently people can be really mean these days, and some can’t differentiate between the fictional character and the real person. What bothered me the most was the fact that people didn’t believe Shae was really in love with Tyrion. But I’m happy that it also could be the other way around. I once met Barack Obama, and he just said, “I am so sorry that they killed you off,” with a big ironic smile. He was very kind and charming. And George R.R. Martin told me that if he had known me earlier, he wouldn’t have me killed. He liked my Shae better than the one in the books.

How did being on the show change your career?

It’s a bit crazy and scary at the same time. Sometimes I get recognized because of the show, even though it has been a while since I have been on the series. Sometimes it’s really funny, because they think they know me from somewhere or have met me before. And if they find out that I played Shae in the show, they immediately say, “Ah! You betrayed Tyrion!”

Who had your favorite death and why?

Viserys’s death was very memorable, and it had such an impact. And sorry to say, Joffrey’s death was very good — he was a horrible king, and his death scene was just magnificent.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>And yet the tone here is completely different. Ocasio-Cortez doesn’t pretend to take the moral high ground or strive for a clinical, prosecutorial demeanor. She has fun with it. At least one reason this video has been watched more than 40 million times is that she has opted for the pretense of a “game,” embracing youthful speech and a breezy, chipper tone:

So, green light for hush money. I can do all sorts of terrible things. It’s totally legal right now for me to pay people off, and that is considered speech. That money is considered speech. So I use my special-interest, dark-money-funded campaign to pay off folks that I need to pay off and get elected. So now I’m elected. Now I’m in. I’ve got the power to draft, lobby and shape the laws that govern the United States of America. Fabulous.

By playing a game, she exposes the game — the way the law allows for behavior the average person might consider corrupt on its face. “It’s already super legal, as we’ve seen, for me to be a pretty bad guy,” she concludes, having prompted witnesses to confirm this. And on top of this game, of course, is a trickier one: The rest of the committee is being asked to indulge a what-if scenario that describes the actual rules under which they were elected. But citing real-world details would break the spell, plunging the whole thing into the mire of accusations. With a low-stakes hypothetical — hey, guys, let’s pretend someone, incredibly, did want to exploit the system — Ocasio-Cortez bends any air of wide-eyed innocence to her advantage. If you really were frivolous or an unwelcome interloper in serious affairs, the upside is that you’d be excused from having to pretend that the rules of serious affairs actually work. You’d be free to be the 2019 version of Elle Woods from “Legally Blonde,” charmingly turning people’s underestimation of you against them.

It’s a strange artifact of Ocasio-Cortez’s attention-magnetism that her hypotheticals about corruption might have ended up garnering more attention and emotion than the corruption itself. But if there’s anything she has shown amazing skill at, it’s knowing how to manage and channel that attention, to let the air out of it and turn it back on whoever paid it. It makes the old model — of keeping your head down and rising above — seem distinctly old. Amid the furious echo chambers of modern media, failing to acknowledge the most absurd image of yourself — failing to laugh at it or own it or hit back at it online — can hurt more than it helps. A caricature of Hillary Clinton, for instance, seemed to obscure her entirely, feeding on her silence. There aren’t too many models for how a woman, in particular, can respond to attacks and antipathy without being looked on as fragile, or shrill, or weak, or vain, or full of grievance.

Ocasio-Cortez is finding one. Today’s fray is too vicious to stay above; it is too handy with Photoshop and social media, too full of noise, too undivided between legitimate sources and illegitimate ones. It’s a mosh pit. There is no dignified attending to your own business in a mosh pit. You keep your elbows ready, and you dance.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>If Medea, who murders her young sons to avenge her pride, is a fit subject for drama, what isn’t?

That is a question you may find yourself asking with a shiver as you arrive at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts to see “Five Easy Pieces,” which opened for a brief run there on Thursday. Seven children, age 11 to 15, sit artfully spaced across the stage, looking innocently at the audience as it prepares to watch them enact a story that makes Medea look like Maria von Trapp.

The story is that of Marc Dutroux, a Belgian pedophile who kidnapped, imprisoned and raped six girls in 1996; two he then buried alive, two starved to death in an underground chamber and two survived. Mr. Dutroux became such a national monster that, even before he was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2004, more than a third of Belgians with the same surname applied to change it.

So why ask children who missed the original to tell the tale now?

For Milo Rau, making his American stage directing debut, the perversity is the point. Commissioned to create a work of children’s theater, he set out to redefine what that genre could mean — and also, it seems, to live up to his reputation as “the world’s most controversial director.” After all, his company, which produced the Skirball engagement along with the Belgian arts center Campo, is called the International Institute of Political Murder.

That he redefines children’s theater, I’ll grant him. There are no puppets, folk songs or happy endings. But if there is controversy in “Five Easy Pieces,” it is, like everything else here, kept at a distance. With its weird calm, its surprising gentleness and its ingenious arsenal of theatrical deflections, it is such an aesthetic experience that it sometimes becomes an anesthetic one. And as thrilling as the writing and stagecraft are, once you finally get behind them I’m not sure you can approve of what’s at its core.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>MAPUTO, Mozambique — Rescue workers struggled Tuesday to reach areas devastated by a huge cyclone in Mozambique, as heavy rains swelled rivers and further isolated flooded communities in what aid agencies called the worst natural disaster in southern Africa in two decades.

In central Mozambique, the area hit hardest by Cyclone Idai, overflowing rivers created “an inland ocean” where countless people were still marooned, a United Nations official said.

Rescue workers reported seeing people on rooftops and in trees days after the storm struck. In areas near the rivers, homes were submerged, with water rising near the tops of telephone poles.

“We took an aerial survey, and as far as the eye can see, there was flooding, and deep as well,” said Jamie LeSueur, who was leading rescue efforts in central Mozambique for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. “What we are now facing is large-scale flooding on top of an area already devastated by the cyclone.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Preet Bharara, the former United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, gained national attention when President Trump abruptly fired him from that job in March 2017. Since then he has been a vocal critic of the president — but his first book, “Doing Justice,” avoids the subject in favor of a broader look at the American judicial system. “I have Twitter to talk about the president and his daily machinations,” Bharara tells Pamela Paul on this week’s podcast. “But if I was going to sit down and write a full volume about justice and what I’ve been doing for much of my adult life, I wanted it not to be just about Trump, Trump Trump Trump, because I think we do that too much sometimes. It’s important to take a step back and talk about first principles. What makes justice work, what makes justice happen, what makes justice not work? What does truth mean, as opposed to truth not being truth? What are real facts as opposed to alternative facts? And then you compare what the right way of doing things is to how far we’ve fallen, I think, from the ideal.”

Doug Jones, the Democratic senator from Alabama, visits us this week to discuss his new memoir, “Bending Toward Justice.” The book unites Alabama's past and present by recalling the 1963 Birmingham church bombing and describing Jones’s 2017 race for the Senate.

Also on this week’s episode, Alexandra Alter has news from the publishing world; and Dwight Garner, Parul Sehgal and Jennifer Szalai talk about the books they’ve recently reviewed. Pamela Paul is the host.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>8th Story, a luxury women’s fashion brand, is opening a showroom in a 1,100-square-foot space in the garment district. The company signed a three-year lease and expects to open its new location this month. The 12-story building was constructed in 1908 and houses more than 100 fashion showrooms.

Josh Hadar, a metal sculptor, is moving to a warehouse built in 1955 in the Claremont neighborhood of the Bronx, where he plans to create larger pieces. The ground floor is 3,320 square feet, and there is a basement. Mr. Hadar rented his previous studio space in Mott Haven.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Named for Thurgood Marshall, the former Supreme Court justice, the organization is often compared to ProPublica, another nonprofit journalism organization that teams up on articles with other publications. The Marshall Project began with 26 employees; it now has 38, with 26 in the newsroom.

“We’ve reached the point where we don’t think of ourselves quite as much as a start-up,” Mr. Keller said in an interview. “We’re doing all these grown-up things like making sure that we have policies on paid leave and sexual harassment, the things you would sort of take for granted when you’re brand-new, but we’re at the stage where you have to institutionalize them.”

Ms. Chira started her career at The Times as a trainee on the metro desk in 1981 after graduating from Harvard. Since then, she said, she has had “the most wonderful time” covering topics like education and business, reporting from Tokyo and writing a book about motherhood.

She is, according to Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The Times, “one of the finest editors I’ve known.”

“We will miss her, but it is great for journalism that she will be running something as important as The Marshall Project,” he said in a statement.

Ms. Chira was one of the longest-serving foreign editors in the history of The Times, managing more than 50 correspondents and overseeing reporting that won several Pulitzers. She is also known for encouraging other journalists in their careers and recently developed a mentoring program at The Times.

At The Marshall Project, she said, she plans to make diversity a priority in recruiting. Many employees of The Marshall Project are early in their careers, Mr. Keller said, “the kind of environment perfect” for Ms. Chira.

“She’s got quality journalism in her DNA, and I’ve watched her work with lots of people,” he said. “She has a gift for getting the best work out of people.”</TEXT>

      <TITLE>Mets Hire ESPN’s Jessica Mendoza in Front-Office Role - The New York Times</TITLE>

      <TEXT>Still, Mendoza’s hire is different. She is perhaps ESPN’s highest-profile baseball voice, one of the network’s most important employees on its most important baseball broadcast. She is currently scheduled to be in the booth for a June game between the Mets and Atlanta Braves.

ESPN shrugged off suggestions of conflict of interest, and argued that Mendoza was far from the first baseball broadcaster to navigate such concerns. “There are numerous examples across networks of these type of arrangements where commentators work closely with teams, and we will be fully transparent about Jessica’s relationship with the Mets,” said Josh Krulewitz, an ESPN spokesman. “We have complete faith in her ability as a leading M.L.B. voice for ESPN.”

ESPN’s relationship with baseball is especially intimate. The network also employs Rodriguez, who is a special adviser for the Yankees, and David Ross, a special assistant for the Cubs. On Tuesday, ESPN also announced that the Yankees pitcher C. C. Sabathia would contribute to various ESPN television shows this season, mostly in coverage of sports other than baseball.

Other networks have similar situations: The retired baseball players Frank Thomas and David Ortiz, who both work for Fox, also have roles with their old teams. But Van Wagenen’s insistence that Mendoza would have input on important baseball decisions seems to set her apart from other broadcasters’ or ex-players’ roles as “special advisers,” a role that tends to be more ceremonial than substantive. Ross and Rodriguez are not listed as part of the front office on their respective teams’ websites, and Thomas is an adviser for business operations. When Ortiz’s role was announced, he focused on his duties of recruiting free agents and making community appearances.

Like ESPN, the Mets are accustomed to the revolving door in the baseball industry. Van Wagenen was hired from Creative Artists Agency, where he represented Mets stars like Jacob deGrom and Yoenis Cespedes. In taking the job, Van Wagenen divested himself from his stake in C.A.A., and he has said that he will recuse himself from any contract negotiations with past clients, including deGrom. If that wasn’t confusing enough, Mendoza is also represented by C.A.A. And then there’s Tim Tebow, working his way up through the Mets’ minor-league ranks while remaining with ESPN as a college football analyst.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>In “Measles Is Making a Comeback. Here’s How to Stop It.,” the editorial board of The New York Times writes:

Measles, a virus that invades the nose and throat, causing fever, cough and phlegm, is one of the most contagious pathogens on the planet. Before 1963, it infected some four million people every year in the United States alone. Nearly 50,000 of them would land in the hospital with complications like severe diarrhea, pneumonia and brain inflammation that sometimes resulted in lifelong disability. Of the 500 or so patients who died from these complications each year, most were children younger than 5. Until recently, those numbers were a matter of history. The measles vaccine, which was introduced to the United States in 1963, drove the annual case count from four million to zero inside of four decades. Measles was officially eradicated in America in 2000 and was largely wiped from our collective memory soon after. But in the shadow of that memory lapse, a different virus has spread: anti-vaccine propaganda and vaccine misinformation. Both have persuaded a small but growing number of parents that vaccines designed to inoculate against infectious diseases pose a greater health risk than the diseases themselves. As a result, these parents are skipping crucial shots for their children. And as the number of unvaccinated children grows, some vaccine-preventable diseases are making a comeback. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has logged at least six measles outbreaks so far this year, across five states, involving more than 100 patients. In recent weeks, as those numbers have ticked upward, both houses of Congress have held hearings to discuss the issue, while more states have considered limiting vaccine exemptions for school-age children and several prominent social media platforms have pledged to block anti-vaccine propaganda and vaccine misinformation from their sites.

The editorial makes several recommendations, including increased government spending and leadership. Here it argues for a greater role from social media companies in combating misinformation about vaccines:

Pinterest, YouTube and Facebook have made a good start in acknowledging the problem of vaccine misinformation on their platforms, and they’ve all taken at least some steps to address it. Pinterest has restricted vaccine search results, YouTube has barred anti-vaccine channels from running advertisements and Facebook has said that it will no longer allow anti-vaccine advertisements on its pages. Other sites — like Google, Amazon and Twitter — should follow these examples, and all social media platforms should consider having scientists vet vaccine content for accuracy. A partnership between federal agencies and private internet behemoths — to better understand and more quickly dismantle the anti-vaccine movement — also would help. As Vox points out, this movement has an outsize media footprint and an impressive lobbying arm; it will take more than a few websites acting independently to defeat it.

And this Times article answers the question: If most people are getting vaccinated, why does it matter if I don’t vaccinate my child?

You are probably thinking of the concept of herd immunity, which means that if a large number of people are protected from a disease by a vaccine, the disease will be less likely to circulate, diminishing the risk for people who are unvaccinated. The threshold for herd immunity varies by disease — for a highly contagious disease, a very high percentage of people need to be vaccinated to meet that threshold. Because measles is so contagious, between 93 percent and 95 percent of people in a community need to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity. Remember, some people can’t be vaccinated for medical reasons: infants, pregnant women and people who are immune compromised.

Students, read the entire editorial, then tell us:

— What is your reaction to the editorial? Should all children be vaccinated?

— Do you find the video and the editorial persuasive? Which argument in the video best explains the fears of anti-vaxxers? Have you ever fallen prey to any of the logical fallacies it describes — for example, confirmation bias, the perfectionist fallacy, or confusing correlation with causation?

— Have you ever seen anti-vaccine propaganda and vaccine misinformation online? Do you find any of the arguments of anti-vaxxers persuasive? How can we combat propaganda and misinformation online?

— While most states have laws requiring students to be vaccinated, many grant exemptions for personal, philosophical or religious beliefs. Do you think these exemptions should be eliminated? Why or why not? How do you think schools should handle children who are unvaccinated?

Medical professionals refer to these parents as “vaccine-hesitant.” As much satisfaction as it might offer to bring my family-room rants — What is wrong with you? — to my conversations with them, I’m starting to believe I can’t simply write them off as idiots. Even presenting facts might not be enough. Those of us who understand how important and safe vaccines are might need to meet them where they are, trying to express empathy for the misguided fear they’re obviously experiencing, if we’re to break through to them and encourage them to make choices that can save lives.

Do you agree? What do you think about parents who choose not to have their children vaccinated? Do you think you will make the choice to have your children vaccinated? Why or why not?

      <TEXT>Before “Southern Promises” begins, the actors gather on the Flea Theater stage to deliver preliminary remarks, mostly underlining that the show’s cast is made up of people of color.

This is integral to Niegel Smith’s revival of Thomas Bradshaw’s 2008 drama because it is set on a plantation in 1848 Virginia. Masters of both sexes graphically rape slaves of both sexes. Brutal violence abounds, both suggested and shown. The N-word is thrown about with casual abandon. (The text includes excerpts from real slave narratives.)

Throughout the evening, you may find yourself circling back to some of those introductory words, especially the ones from actors who said they were of mixed heritage. “I’m just as much slave owner as I am slave,” one of them, Adam Coy, says. “Every character in this show is me. Every one of these characters are my ancestors.”

This complicates a story that, on the face of it, is relatively straightforward for all its horror. The married Isaiah and Elizabeth (Darby Davis and Brittany Zaken) own another couple, Benjamin and Charlotte (Shakur Tolliver and Yvonne Jessica Pruitt). Despite Isaiah informing both his wife and Benjamin that he wants all his slaves freed after his death, Elizabeth reneges on the pledge. Encouraged by her brother, John (Marcus Jones), the young widow eventually marries Isaiah’s brother, David (Jahsiah Rivera) — all the while forcing Benjamin to sexually service her.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>After Mr. Dean’s death, the sheriff’s department said it would review Mr. Moore’s death and conduct follow-up interviews.

“It is suspicious that this has happened twice now, so we’re going to conduct a thorough investigation to determine if it is criminal in nature,” Lt. Derrick Alfred of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department told KTLA-TV, a local television station, in January.

The sheriff’s department declined to answer further questions about its investigation on Monday. The Los Angeles County district attorney’s office said no charges had yet been filed in the case and did not answer further questions on the cause of death.

The Los Angeles County medical examiner’s office did not respond to requests for comment Monday.

Mr. Dean was described as a fashion consultant and spent many years competing in basketball leagues and the Gay Games, an international sporting event modeled after the Olympics, including in last year’s Games in Paris, according to Mark Chambers, a longtime friend of Mr. Dean’s.

Mr. Dean had been friends with Mr. Buck, Mr. Chambers said.

Mr. Buck rose to national prominence in the late 1980s, when he led a movement to oust Gov. Evan Mecham of Arizona, a Republican, who was later impeached over fraud and perjury allegations.

Mr. Buck has given more than $116,000 to Democratic candidates and groups in the past decade or so.

Mr. Buck gave about $1,500 to support Barack Obama and $2,950 to back Hillary Clinton, according to OpenSecrets.org, which tracks campaign fund-raising. Mr. Buck is also prominent in L.G.B.T. political circles and ran unsuccessfully for the West Hollywood City Council about a decade ago.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>MONACA, Pa. — The expansive Royal Dutch Shell chemical processing plant under construction on a big bend of the Ohio River in western Pennsylvania is one of the largest and most expensive projects ever to be built along the tributary.

It’s not only the plant’s mammoth scale that has attracted attention. Just as significant is the project’s location: 30 miles northwest of Pittsburgh, on a river that for four decades has been a corridor of Rust Belt industrial ruin.

That era is over, Shell executives say. The sentiment is shared by the region’s tradespeople, business executives and political leaders, who are eager to strengthen the economies of towns along the river.

For the first time in two generations, steel girders and worn tubing are not being dismantled along the banks of the upper Ohio and shipped away. Instead, new parts are being assembled by Bechtel, Shell’s primary contractor, into a world-scale, state-of-the-art chemical processor to convert liquid natural gas into polyethylene, a common plastic.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>PHOENIX — The N.F.L., in a first, will allow challenges on pass interference next season, whether flags were thrown by referees or not.

The rule change, approved by a 31-1 vote of the league’s owners on Tuesday, came about two months after a controversial non-call on an apparent pass interference play influenced the outcome of the N.F.C. championship game between the Los Angeles Rams and the New Orleans Saints.

Many Saints fans, believing that the non-call led to their team’s loss, refused to watch the broadcast of the Super Bowl between the Rams and the New England Patriots.

For one year only, coaches will be able to ask for a video review of possible pass interference plays, whether they have been called on the field or not. Those reviews can come in the first 28 minutes of each half. In the last two minutes of the halves, only replay officials may request a review.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>That is not Mr. Gupta’s approach. He is aggressively unrepentant. He maintains he is innocent despite the jury verdict against him on three counts of securities fraud and one charge of conspiracy. (He was found not guilty on two other counts.)

Mr. Gupta’s book, “Mind Without Fear,” to be published next week, tells the story of how his career unraveled. It is a propulsive narrative filled with boldfaced names from business and politics. At times, it is a dishy score settler.

Mr. Gupta never testified at his trial, a decision he said he regretted. While he gives a full-throated self-defense in the book that is fuller than the one the jury heard, much of the outlines were already heard — and rejected — in court. The book requires the reader to suspend disbelief in the judicial system. Some readers may sympathize with him while others may find his arguments unconvincing.

Mr. Gupta recounts virtually every scene in the past decade of his life, from the moment he learned that he was under investigation (he got a phone call from the general counsel of Goldman Sachs while he was in line at airport security) to when he was released from prison.

The closest Mr. Gupta comes in the book, or in his interview with me, to acknowledging any error on his part is when he notes that he shouldn’t have trusted Mr. Rajaratnam and that he spoke a little too loosely when he discussed Goldman’s corporate secrets on a phone call that the F.B.I. secretly recorded.

Mr. Gupta, it seems, spent his time in prison trying to make the best of his circumstances — and occasionally hanging out with Mr. Rajaratnam.

“We played Scrabble in prison together. We played chess. We had breakfast together,” he told me. Most of their conversations were about “prison stuff, you know?”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>A strong winter storm struck Colorado and other parts of the central United States on Wednesday, sending hurricane-force winds and heavy snow across the region, meteorologists said.

The fierce winter weather, part of which classified as a “bomb cyclone,” pummeled Denver and other areas in Colorado, and rapidly intensified throughout the day as it pushed east and north, the National Weather Service said.

Heavy rains turned to snow, blizzard conditions and high winds and affected parts of the country from the Central Rockies across the Plains, and from the Mississippi Valley into the upper Great Lakes, including Wyoming, Nebraska, Kansas and South Dakota.

In Colorado, Gov. Jared Polis declared a state of emergency, making more resources available to react to the storm. Winds reached a high of 94 miles per hour, and some areas saw up to four feet of snow. Visibility reached near zero, and travel plans were disrupted throughout the state. Schools were closed on Wednesday in Denver, Littleton and several other cities.</TEXT>

Last week, Emma Fitzsimmons, a transit reporter for The Times, wrote about the strange disparity in New York City’s subway lines, exploring why lettered lines — notably the F — performed particularly badly. We noticed that the subway system skips only a few letters of the alphabet, and asked her to explain.

The letters missing from the current subway map either were removed over the years or never existed because officials thought they might confuse riders. An I train could have been mistaken for a 1, or an O train for zero.

There once was an H train — a shuttle line in Rockaway Park, Queens — but in 1992 it was changed to an S for shuttle.</TEXT>

His exit comes as better-known Democrats like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. prepare to announce their own plans for 2020, and as the field itself has swelled to 14 candidates, including fellow liberal senators like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.

Allies of Mr. Brown said on Thursday that his decision to forgo a 2020 bid had nothing to do with the signs that Mr. Biden is preparing to enter the race. Rather, they said, Mr. Brown ultimately resolved that he was content in the Senate and lacked the consuming drive to become president. And there were obvious practical obstacles to the 2020 nomination for a 66-year-old white man with a mix of liberal and moderate views and a relatively modest donor base. Indeed, for Mr. Brown, the popularity and fund-raising strength of Mr. Sanders, a fellow populist, were obstacles that were at least as big as any Mr. Biden might present.

[Why are so many Democrats bowing out of a 2020 campaign this week? Here are four reasons.]

Speaking to reporters between votes in the Capitol on Thursday, Mr. Brown quickly noted that he “didn’t have a lifelong ambition to be president.” Though he argued that there was a “path for me,” highlighting his progressive credentials, he said he felt tugged to remain in the Senate, a job he relishes more than some of his colleagues who covet the presidency.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“After Match Day I told Meijer’s leadership that I have to go to Alabama because my fiancé is contractually obligated to go there,” Mr. Ansorge said. “I think the fact that we were engaged made it more serious for them. He wasn’t just my boyfriend. I wasn’t just running away to be in love and do something crazy.”

Another benefit to proposing on Match Day is that the couple’s closest friends and family are already present for the ceremony. This makes it easier to keep the other reason for their presence a surprise.

“I guess I should have known what was happening because most people had five or so family members in the crowd and I had almost 30,” Ms. Davis said.

If there is a downside to this new tradition it’s the timing. Many couples have no time to plan a wedding when at least one person is moving (most likely two) and starting a new job.

“Sometimes I work 80, 85 hours a week,” Mr. Ansorge said. “We just picked up our lives and moved to Alabama, and I started a new job. It seems like a lot to put on a wedding on top of us. Luckily we have no pressure from family or friends to set a date, so we haven’t yet.”

Mr. Sanders felt the same way. “We don’t want that long of an engagement, but it would be a lot to get married right now,” he said. “Next year I’ll be starting my intern year. Then I want to do a fellowship after that. We got to one light at the end of the tunnel, but there are more tunnels. We’ll do it when it feels more manageable.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>A Shakespeare play is like a Hallmark card. There is one for every occasion. When you have an audience embroiled in problems of governance — and since no one has thought to release the Mueller report in iambic pentameter — might as well pluck “Julius Caesar” off the shelf.

A political nail-gnawer about a self-absorbed populist and the men who conspire to impeach him one knife wound at a time, “Julius Caesar” is practically bespoke for 2019 America. Surely someone has already fantasy-cast it with Democratic hopefuls. Elizabeth Warren as Metellus Cimber? Discuss. But Shana Cooper’s revival at Theater for a New Audience — busy and butch — is so deep in conversation with itself and its dance battles that it nearly forgets to speak to us today.

Ms. Cooper’s production originated at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in 2017, just before the Public Theater’s Breitbart-baiting staging, which featured a cigar-puffing combed-over Gregg Henry as Caesar. Here, the analogues are fuzzier, nearly opaque. We don’t seem to be in Rome, or necessarily in America either, but in some half-made city-state of the mind. The set, by Sibyl Wickersheimer, is a loose scaffold of plastic sheeting, plywood pallets and splintered Sheetrock. (Has anyone ever blamed Rome’s decline and fall on bad contractors?) This is a house already divided against itself. Anyone in the first few rows should probably be issued a hard hat.

The play, here titled “The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,” begins with a crew of plebes dressed in gray masks, white dreads and jean shorts. Apparently, they’re celebrating Lupercalia, though their frolic looks a lot more like heavy metal night on the Westside piers. (Despite the casting of women in a few small male roles, this is a homosocial world and potentially a homoerotic one — a lot of the pants are too tight.) A ceiling cradle spills confetti, and here comes Caesar (Rocco Sisto), smug and smiling, cruising through the crowd like some conquering schooner. Already a hero, Caesar, we are told, wants to be a king, a tyrant, maybe even a god. For the Roman Republic to live, and because obstruction charges aren’t really an option, Caesar has to die.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>LIMA, Ohio — It is an obsession he cannot seem to shake.

Senator John McCain of Arizona has been dead for seven months, but President Trump’s feud with him is very much alive, and in front of a military audience at a tank plant here in Lima, Ohio, on Wednesday, he took it to a new level.

He said he gave Mr. McCain “the funeral he wanted, and I didn’t get ‘thank you,’” exaggerating the role he played in honoring the senator’s death four days before his 82nd birthday.

He blamed him for “a war in the Middle East that McCain pushed so hard.” He said that “McCain didn’t get the job done for our great vets” and the Department of Veterans Affairs. And he was blunt in saying that his animosity toward Mr. McCain was not going to change.

“I have to be honest: I’ve never liked him much,” Mr. Trump said, about 10 minutes into a freewheeling speech that was ostensibly about the resurgence of manufacturing jobs. “Hasn’t been for me. I’ve really — probably never will.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Where do kids who go to specialized high schools go to college? There’s been lots of debate about whether a diploma from a specialized high school is a ticket to the Ivy League. Many students who graduate from specialized high schools go to SUNY (State University of New York) schools and other state colleges.

Eliza explained the factors parents use to decide between a private school and a public one.

This is a huge question right now as the city considers integration measures — especially considering the last time the city tried to integrate its schools, in the 1960s, some white parents boycotted their public schools and others fled to the suburbs or enrolled their kids in private schools. The question of students fleeing the public school system has kind of been a specter looming over this whole debate, even beyond the specialized high schools.

Though the percentage of white families enrolling in New York City public schools has declined over the last few decades, it’s been pretty flat at 15 percent for a few years, relative to their 30 percent representation in the city population as a whole. While some parents have threatened to pull their kids out of the system, it’s certainly not an easy thing to do: N.Y.C. private schools are extremely expensive — $50,000 a year or more — and their admissions are just as competitive as at the elite public schools, if not more so.

One user asked about a lawsuit, filed by civil rights organizations, contesting the use of the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test. The groups say that black and Latino students do not receive the same preparation and that a single high-stakes test is not a fair measure of merit.

I have also been surprised by how little they’ve participated in a debate they helped start. They put out a statement after the results came out this week (“It’s clear that the barriers to entry that keep talented black and Latinx students out must be dismantled, and yet the city is being challenged over its modest efforts to begin that process. Expanding diversity at these schools benefits all students, and the city should be encouraged to do more to address acute racial disparities, not less.”)

But I thought that was pretty vague. As far as I know that lawsuit has gone nowhere. You also raise a broader issue: why hasn’t the mayor been able to build a coalition to support his plan? To me, it seems like Richard Buery and a few other specialized high school alumni are doing all the work for City Hall. Why isn’t there a broader coalition of civil rights groups, or black and Hispanic politicians, as you’ve asked many times.

Don’t know whether that speaks to the mayor’s apparent inability to create political coalitions or whether the people you would think would support the plan — including the Brooklyn borough president, Eric Adams, whose reversal from one of the strongest advocates of an admissions overhaul to vaguely opposed speaks volumes about this debate.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The collector witnessed another side of the human condition firsthand as a young boy growing up in Tehran. In 1978 his father, who was in banking and real estate, sensed unrest and moved the family to a home they had in London, “just for the summer,” Mr. Rashidian said. But the Shah of Iran was deposed in January 1979 and the family — its banks confiscated and some of its friends killed — never left England. Mr. Rashidian, now 52, lived in London most of his life before moving to Switzerland three years ago, trading the city for the mountains.

Nature was an important part of the collector’s early years, too. When he was 5 he started hunting with his uncle. “It wasn’t about killing,” he said, but being outdoors and “experiencing nature in the rain, the snow, in all its guises.” His shoots might have taken him to Ethiopia or Tajikistan for weeks at a time, sleeping in tents or shacks. “You have to love the outdoors,” he said.

Hunting led him to create the cultishly popular Pro Hunter watch in 2006 after Rolex refused to customize one of its watches with a black case and glass (to eliminate reflection), fixed lugs and a NATO strap (to replace a bracelet that, Mr. Rashidian said, “you can’t crawl with, it digs in.”) So he developed his own timepiece.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>LONDON — Nirav Modi, whose opulent necklaces have been worn by A-list celebrities, was in custody in London after being denied bail following his arrest this week in a bank fraud in India totaling nearly $3 billion.

The Indian government wants to extradite Mr. Modi from Britain to face charges that he, his family and business associates assembled a global empire with money obtained illegally, mostly from government-run banks.

Mr. Modi, whom the authorities had sought since early last year, was arrested in central London on Tuesday after trying to open a bank account, according to news reports.

Mr. Modi’s lawyer, George Hepburne Scott, said at a bail hearing on Wednesday that Mr. Modi had been living lawfully in London since before the allegations were made last year, according to Reuters. But the district judge, Marie Mallon, was not persuaded and denied bail.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Sandwiches, with all their permutations, are an invitation to overzealous tinkering. They can be stacked up toward heaven in multiple layers or stuffed with an entire Thanksgiving dinner. They can overflow with soupy meats and be eaten with a fork and knife. And then there was that time KFC used fried chicken instead of bread to do the hard work of containing sliced cheese and bacon. The risk is that a particularly kooky sandwich values shock over logic.

At first glance, the Porkinator — served at Pilar Cuban Bakery in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn — seems to be one of these sandwiches, designed as a dare. It is named like a character in professional wrestling, and contains five different types of pig product.

But instead of veering into carny-sideshow territory, it turns out to be far more clever and earnest. There are crunchy starbursts of chicharrón, housemade chorizo that tastes as if someone bottled a smokehouse, and whole ham croquetas, their insides gently funky and hot-dog pink. A smooth ham-pimento spread acts as both condiment and stabilizer, keeping the thing from turning into a mess on the wax-paper-lined plastic boats that Pilar serves almost everything in. It’s a wild sandwich that makes beautiful sense.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“They’re taking all these susceptible kids and taking them out of circulation, in effect,” he said.

Officials are particularly worried because measles is among the most contagious of the infectious diseases. The virus can live for up to two hours in the airspace where an infected person has breathed, coughed or sneezed, and up to 90 percent of nonimmunized people who are exposed to the virus will also become infected, according to the C.D.C.

The M.M.R. vaccine, when given in two doses, is about 97 percent effective against measles.

Daniel Salmon, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said the risk that the unvaccinated children would spread the disease to people who could not, for medical reasons or age, be vaccinated made Rockland County’s order reasonable.

“One could even argue they’re compelled to take action because they’re responsible for protecting the public,” he said.

Rockland County officials, Mr. Day said, do not plan on “chasing people down” and asking for proof that they are vaccinated. The prohibition will be enforced retroactively, with parents facing up to six months in jail or a fine of up to $500, or both, if they are found to have allowed unvaccinated children in public spaces.

Rabbi Yakov Horowitz, the founding dean of Yeshiva Darchei Noam in Monsey, N.Y., a community at the center of Rockland County’s measles outbreak, said he strongly supports vaccinations, but he is worried that the county’s declaration might lead to potential harassment, attacks and discrimination against ultra-Orthodox Jews.

Some public health law experts also expressed concern that the county’s order could infringe on civil liberties.

Lawrence O. Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University, said he found Rockland County’s emergency order deeply problematic.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea on Friday withdrew its staff from the joint liaison office it has operated with South Korea since September, signaling a hardening of its position toward the South weeks after the failed summit meeting between the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, and President Trump.

North Korean staff at the liaison office in Kaesong, a North Korean town just north of the two countries’ border, packed up and left on Friday, saying they had been ordered to do so, the South’s Ministry of National Unification said. They did not ask their South Korean counterparts to leave, the ministry said.

“We consider the North Koreans’ decision regrettable and hope that they will return as early as possible so the liaison office can resume its normal operation,” the ministry said in a statement.

It was the North’s latest show of discontent since the talks in Hanoi, Vietnam, between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump over the North’s nuclear arms program ended without a deal. North Korea blamed what it called “an atmosphere of hostility and mistrust” created by Washington for the breakdown in negotiations.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The drummer Bobby Colomby co-founded the New York jazz-rock group Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears, which grew to eight by the time of its 1968 debut. Band members left and were replaced, and by 1974, Colomby was the only original member in the group. “We had an agreement: Last man standing owns it,” he said.

While Colomby took a less itinerant job, as an executive at CBS Records, he leased the Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears name to David Clayton-Thomas, who sang the group’s signature hits, including “Spinning Wheel,” but was not an original member. After a 20-year lease, Clayton-Thomas formed a new band in 2004, so Colomby hired musicians to tour as his salaried employees. “As far as I’m concerned, as long as I’m the guy behind it, it’s still the original band,” he said, adding that if his 1960s bandmates still played in the group, “you’d see guys with walkers onstage.”

Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears still play 55 to 65 shows a year, according to its manager, Larry Dorr. In a phone interview with Dorr and Colomby, neither could name all current members of the band. But Colomby likens it to a franchise: “When you go to a Yankees game, what do you see? There’s no Babe Ruth, no Mickey Mantle. But you’re going to see the pinstripes, a tradition, a style.” Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears, he insists, isn’t a group of specific people, “it’s a musical concept.”

Soft rock bands are not exempt from legal feuds. Wayne Nelson, a bassist who joined the Little River Band in time for the successful group’s sixth album in 1981, said with a laugh, “We fought as much as a metal band, but it was all passive-aggressive.” Nelson was a paid employee first, and then was made a partner via LRB Proprietary Ltd., the group’s unit trust. When singer Glenn Shorrock left, he was paid $85,000 to turn over his shares, Nelson said.

Eventually, the name was owned by the guitarist Stephen Housden, who had joined for the group’s seventh album, and stopped touring in 2006. Now, Nelson effectively licenses the trademark from Housden, who earns tour income without ever leaving his home.

Shorrock and two other founding members tried to perform as the Original Little River Band, but Housden forced them to change the name. Since then, the band’s ex-members have called the current lineup “a tribute band” and “a joke.” No musician grows up dreaming of fighting in court and parrying insults, but, Nelson concluded, “That’s the life of a band in these times.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Being Texans, though, many of the people who live between the fence and the river say they don’t count exclusively on the government to keep them safe. One recent afternoon, a retired refrigerator repairman wearing camouflage clothing strolled south of the wall with a handgun in a holster on his hip. Mr. Monsees was even more heavily armed as he spoke outside his home while sitting in his pickup truck.

“This is a single-shot .410, and that’s a single-shot .22, and I keep the pistol between the seats,” he said.

In another buffer-zone community along the river about 50 miles northwest of Brownsville, on a muddy dirt road outside the town of Donna, Arturo Munoz, 72, sat in the carport of his house just south of the border fence, sipping a Bud Light. His dog Max lay at his feet.

“It’s just about the same as on the north side,” said Mr. Munoz, a retired welder and Vietnam veteran, though he conceded that he has no mail service, no landline telephone and no cable television.

He said he bought the property nearly 15 years ago because he grew up nearby and feels a connection to the area. When it came time to build the border fence, he said, the government made him an offer he could refuse, and he did. He stayed put, and the wall went up just north of his white-brick home, right behind a line of trees in his back yard.

“It’s a lot safer than in town,” he said. “I lived in town. I was renting, and got broke into three times.”

He described riding his bicycle near his house one day and seeing a few migrants walking along. He said he waved to them and pedaled on. They had crossed the river on their journey to America, and had found it. Sort of.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>On Tuesday, the Justice Department opened an investigation into alleged election fraud in North Carolina’s Ninth Congressional District. Neither the details of the crime nor the culprits, however, match the scenario that has led to an array of Voter ID laws, voter roll purges and similar efforts “to protect the integrity of the ballot box.”

The Republicans would have the nation believe that the threat to our democracy is from voter fraud, where someone impersonates someone else to cast an illegal ballot or multiple ballots to “steal elections.” But the chance of voter fraud occurring is, at best, 0.0000044 percent.

The real theft of American democracy happens through election fraud and voter suppression. And Republicans are the thieves.

What happened in North Carolina during the 2018 midterms was a textbook case of election fraud. That’s when a candidate’s campaign sets out to manipulate vote tallies to steal an election.</TEXT>

The cakes are large yeasted pastries (more of a cinnamon roll than a birthday cake) topped with icing and glittery sprinkles. A plastic baby is hidden inside the loaf. Whoever gets the slice with the figurine inside is “king” for the day and obligated to host next year’s Mardi Gras party.

“No one has a king cake” in New York, said St. John Frizell, a restaurateur who lived in New Orleans for a decade before moving here in 1999.

He was exaggerating, but only a little. A handful of New York establishments sell it, including Whole Foods and some fancy bakeries.

Yet, finding good king cake is hard. One man jokingly wrote on Twitter that he was quitting his job “to open a full-time king cake bakery in NYC because I can’t find a single place that reliably sells them.”

By now, it’s too late to order the real stuff from New Orleans. And even the delicious-looking substitutes offered by the Doughnut Plant are, somehow, not quite the same.

When asked if he served king cake at his restaurant in Red Hook, Mr. Frizell laughed.

“You would never see it at a restaurant,” he said. “You do want to experience it, not for the taste but for the sensation of sharing with friends and family at Mardi Gras time.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Rabbi Irving Greenberg, who was the president of the Steinhardt Foundation for Jewish Life for a decade, said he repeatedly rebuked Mr. Steinhardt for using belittling language toward both men and women. That tension was a factor in his deciding to leave the job in 2007. (After this story published, the Steinhardt family and foundations released a statement, which can be read here.)

Mr. Steinhardt could be harsh with men, but his comments to women focused on their appearance and fertility, Rabbi Greenberg said. When Mr. Steinhardt talked to women, the rabbi said, “the implication was that they were not on par with men.”

He said that the comments were made in a bantering, not threatening, tone and that he never saw Mr. Steinhardt directly proposition anyone. Still, he said, “I understand that the women felt more shaken or threatened than I recognized at the time.”

Ms. Katz said she was hoping Mr. Steinhardt would become a funder of her work at Hillel when she met with him in his Fifth Avenue office in 2015 to interview him for a video Hillel had commissioned about Jewish entrepreneurs. But she said that as the filming got underway, he repeatedly asked if she would have sex with the “king of Israel,” which he had told her was his preferred title for the video. He then directly asked her to have sex with him, she said.

When she turned him down, he brought in two male employees and offered a million dollars if she were to marry one of them, she said. After the filming ended, Mr. Steinhardt told her it was an “abomination” that a woman who looked like her was not married and said he would not fund her projects until she returned with a husband and child, said Ms. Katz, who has not previously spoken publicly about the incident.

Through his spokesman, Mr. Goldin, Mr. Steinhardt denied most of the details of Ms. Katz’s story and said he did not “proposition” anyone. Mr. Goldin said Mr. Steinhardt was not aware that Ms. Katz was courting him as a donor when they met.

Ms. Katz said she was shaken and reported the comments the next day to Eric D. Fingerhut, the chief executive of Hillel. He apologized and promised that she would not have to meet with Mr. Steinhardt again, she said. Hillel confirmed generally that Ms. Katz reported the incident but would not comment on specifics.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Founded a decade ago by a small group of private dealers, New York City’s Asia Week now includes dozens of shows mounted by local and international galleries as well as auctions at all the major houses. It’s a rare opportunity to see antiquities and esoterica that are otherwise hidden away in private collections.

[Read more about what to see in New York art galleries this weekend.]

In all, 16 museums and cultural institutions are participating in Asia Week New York, which is running through March 23. Here we explore Manhattan’s most notable exhibitions, along with a sprinkling of interesting gallery shows. And if looking at art from the other side of the world inspires you to travel, consider heading to the Charles B. Wang Center at Stony Brook University for a show of Islamic poster art, or to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, which just finished renovating its Chinese galleries.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Ghosts were always going to be part of the star violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter’s recital at Carnegie Hall this week. The advertised program featured Mozart, as well as the spirit of that composer as it flickers through later French music. And the concert was also to include Sebastian Currier’s new “Ghost Trio,” which riffs on themes of influence and musical forebears.

But when Ms. Mutter and her longtime chamber music partner, the pianist Lambert Orkis, took to the stage at Carnegie Hall on Tuesday, the specter most strongly felt was that of André Previn, the conductor, composer and musical polymath. Ms. Mutter and Mr. Previn were once married, and remained close friends and artistic collaborators until his death on Feb. 28.

And so, at the end of an evening of brilliant and often uncannily delicate music-making, Ms. Mutter played two Previn works as encores. She dedicated them to him — “wherever he is now,” she said with a spiraling gesture taking in the air around and above her.

[Hear the many facets of Mr. Previn, a musical polymath.]

Ms. Mutter has built her career on a rich, glossy tone and glamorous stage presence. She is one of the few violinists who can pull off solo recitals in Carnegie’s big hall. On this occasion, she used her magnetism to draw listeners into a world of sounds that included pallid, watery tones a mere whisper away from silence.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>If there is a way to write about Kristine Haruna Lee’s vivid, haunted “Suicide Forest” without mentioning the ending, I don’t know what it is. Because when the fourth wall breaks, this nightmare-vision play about Japanese-American identity cracks wide open, and what’s underneath is so heart-stingingly tender and explicitly personal that the whole work shifts.

Here, then, is an emphatic piece of advice: Go see it at the Bushwick Starr, where Aya Ogawa has directed a wild ride of a production. And here is a warning: spoilers dead ahead.

The first figure we see in “Suicide Forest,” moving slowly around the edge of the proscenium, is a god in scarlet silk. White-faced and raven-haired, with soft red pigment at the corners of her eyes, this is Mad Mad. Her presence stalks this play.

Ms. Lee is also an actor in it, portraying a teenage Japanese schoolgirl named Azusa. But deep in the performance, after the vibrant pink-and-white interior of Jian Jung’s set has given way to the eerie abstractness of the woods, Ms. Lee drops the mask of her role. She becomes, disarmingly, her Seattle-raised self, speaking directly to the audience, taking ownership of the issues of heritage that fuel her play.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled against sailors injured in the 2000 bombing of the destroyer Cole in Yemen by Qaeda operatives, saying the sailors had failed to serve their legal papers properly in a lawsuit against the government of Sudan. The decision threw out a $314 million default judgment, though the court said the sailors should be able to pursue further litigation.

The attack killed 17 American sailors and injured dozens more. Fifteen of the injured sailors and three of their spouses sued Sudan by delivering a copy of their suit to its embassy in Washington. The suit said Sudan had harbored and supported Osama bin Laden and other members of Al Qaeda in the years before the bombing.

The question for the justices was whether the suit had been properly served. A federal law allows service against foreign governments “by any form of mail requiring a signed receipt, to be addressed and dispatched” to “the head of the ministry of foreign affairs of the foreign state concerned.”

Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., writing for eight members of the court, said the language of the statute required sending the legal papers to the foreign ministry in Sudan rather than Sudan’s embassy in Washington.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“I have a solid six ideas every single day for a business,” said Ariel Arce, the owner of two Greenwich Village hot spots: Tokyo Record Bar and Air’s Champagne Parlor. “That’s not to say that all of those are good ideas. But because I’m naturally really impulsive, I just want to do it and I want to get people involved in it. And I shouldn’t do that.”

Still, Ms. Arce, 31, has not been able to limit herself. Two years after opening those first two venues, frequented by actors and comedians like Jake Gyllenhaal, Mandy Moore, Wanda Sykes and Olivia Wilde, she is opening two more restaurants this spring.

At Niche Niche, which opens next week at 43 Macdougal Street, a sommelier or some other beverage nerd will pick four wines per night, and food will be cooked to match. Customers pay $40 for the tasting and $40 for food.

In April, Special Club, a supper club that will feature live musicians, will open in the same building. (The building previously housed an Italian-American social club that was plagued by rumors about organized crime.)</TEXT>

Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli of Nepal said in a Twitter message Sunday that he had received a report of 25 people killed and 400 injured.

He said security forces have been alerted and that rescue teams and helicopters with night-vision capabilities were waiting for the weather to clear to help the injured people from affected villages.

A government administrator, Rajesh Poudel, said the number of deaths would likely increase because the storm had hit many villages in the Bara District, located about 75 miles south of the capital, Kathmandu.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>President Trump has tried to halt the arrival of undocumented migrants by beefing up border security, limiting who qualifies for asylum and, for a while, separating migrant children from their parents at the border. However, figures released on Tuesday suggest that those measures are failing to deter tens of thousands of migrants from journeying over land to the United States.

Indeed, after shriveling to the smallest total in five decades, the number of migrants intercepted at the southern border — the best indicator of how many undocumented people are entering the United States — is soaring again.

Border authorities detained nearly twice as many migrants — 268,044 — in the first five months of the fiscal year that started in October than were detained in the same period the previous year.

To understand what’s happening, it’s important to look at who is coming, what is driving them and how the answers to those questions have changed over the years.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I started this 10-second rabbit project a little over a decade ago as a way of channeling the artistic curiosity of the inspiring people around me. At parties I’d collect unsigned, loose-leaf doodles from people around a room, and then we’d guess who drew each based on our assumptions about one another. Like handwriting analysis, but with bunnies. Why bunnies? Because they’re tough to mistake for any other creature, thanks to the exaggerated stretch of their ears. They’re fun to draw even for people who possess no art skills at all. (Plus, imagine asking Jonathan Lethem to draw a chicken.) I later began asking authors at readings to sign their books with a rabbit, scrawled in 10 seconds or less. The time limit gave the whimsical scheme structure, and it also put participants at ease; I wasn’t asking for serious art. Still, they’d often protest, “I can’t draw!” before inevitably conceding, and eventually admitting they enjoyed the break from routinely asking to whom they should inscribe the book. Margaret Atwood, for one, embraced my request with a glow: “This is great!” she said, adding a carrot. Others (I’ve amassed 70 of these over the years), both reluctant and charmed, would sigh a “here goes” as I counted to 10.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Good Monday morning. Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today.
• In his meeting with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, President Trump made a bet that his force of personality and view of himself as a consummate dealmaker would succeed where three previous presidents had failed. But his offer was essentially the same deal that the U.S. has pushed for a quarter-century.
• Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, appeared to signal support for a resolution that would overturn Mr. Trump’s declaration of a national emergency at the southern border, which would provide the crucial vote needed for the Senate to pass the measure.
• In an effort to accommodate Mr. Trump, the nation’s intelligence agencies have revamped their presentations — instead of terrorism or spies, they focus on which countries are making money or gaining financial advantage.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>DUNEDIN, New Zealand — The gun enthusiast with light brown hair and an Australian accent did not stand out among the 100 or so members of the Bruce Rifle Club, who practiced shooting at a range in a forest in southern New Zealand.

He favored a bolt-action hunting rifle and an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle and would participate in shooting competitions. No one saw any warning signs.

“He was polite,” said Scott Williams, the club’s vice president. “He would help put things away. He would help set up. He worked like a Trojan.”

But now New Zealand officials are wondering if anyone might have missed something about Brenton Harrison Tarrant, the 28-year-old suspect in the shootings at two mosques in Christchurch on Friday that left at least 50 people dead.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>It has a lot to do with it. I think there are three key things that have contributed to the changing politics of climate change, Michael. One, as you said, absolutely — just in the past year or two alone, there have been major new reports that say, clearly and definitively, a lot of the extreme weather events that we are seeing now are caused by climate change. Second thing is polling shows that millennials, who will soon be the largest voting demographic — that this is an issue they care about more than almost anything else. That’s a big change. The third thing, I think, that politicians are paying attention to is President Trump. President Trump has made climate change an issue because he has elevated climate policy. He has said he’s going to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement. He’s rolling back climate change regulations. He mocks climate science. So all of those present a clear way for his prospective opponents to carve out a strong position against him.

Schumer is a politician, and so he sees that there is all of this millennial energy around the Green New Deal and around climate change. And he’s looking at the fact that people are asking questions about this when candidates go out to town halls in a way that they never have. So he wants to harness all this energy. He wants to make sure that millennials who care about climate change are still excited about Democrats and don’t think that these are fogies of yesteryear. But he wants to find a way to pivot away from the Green New Deal and come up, essentially, with a real piece of legislation that would be, probably, a lot more realistic and something that candidates could live with and that could be brought up on the Senate floor after an election.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>After Meek Mill was released, Mr. Rubin asked Mr. Kraft to join his efforts to create an organization called Reform Alliance, to fight for changes to criminal justice practices. The eight founders, including Jay-Z and Daniel Loeb, a billionaire investor, pledged a combined $50 million.

Meek Mill sees echoes of his experiences in Mr. Kraft’s current predicament. “They aligned his name with a different set of charges that weren’t tied to him at all,” he said.

There are big differences, and Meek Mill has made sure Mr. Kraft appreciates them too. “I said it to Robert the other day, ‘Someone as powerful as you, you have done so much good in the world and brung so much to America, you see what they did to you,’” Meek Mill said. “I said to him, ‘Imagine someone that comes from poverty in the ghetto who doesn’t have people to speak up for them on their behalf. It happens in my community every day.’”

Mr. Kraft grew up in Brookline, Mass., loving sports, though joining teams was difficult because he couldn’t play on the Sabbath. He liked the Boston Braves baseball team.

He went to college at Columbia, on scholarship. As a senior, he went back to Boston for a football game and spotted Myra Hiatt in a delicatessen. He waited until her date went to the restroom and then introduced himself. He went to the library on the Brandeis campus the next day to look her up, and they married the following year.

Myra finished college, and they had four sons ; three work for the family business.

After attending Harvard Business School, Mr. Kraft went to work for his father-in-law. Mr. Kraft had his own vision for the company, and left but eventually purchased the business and began to build a fortune in paper and packaging. As he did, he and Mrs. Kraft established themselves as a power couple in Boston’s charity scene. The family has given away “h undreds of millions of dollars,” a Patriots spokesman said.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“The ideas expressed in this manifesto are pretty widely shared beyond the really fanatic fringe — in not just the far-right but also the mainstream,” said Tore Bjørgo, director of the Center for Research on Extremism at the University of Oslo. “But there are very few” — outside the extreme fringes of the extreme-right — “who would take it one step further and try to start a race war.”

The killer’s ability to livestream the attack via his own social media channels — which led to the dissemination of the video and manifesto across YouTube, Facebook and several mainstream media outlets — also highlights how the far-right has harnessed the reach of major media and technology companies, even as it continues to spread its message through the dark corners of obscure internet sites.

By broadcasting his atrocity himself, the killer was able to both circumvent the traditional gatekeepers of news coverage, while also encouraging those same gatekeepers to subsequently regurgitate some of his footage and even unwittingly amplify his ideas to millions more potential imitators than he might otherwise have reached.

“It’s clearly made for media coverage,” Dr. Bjørgo said.

And by writing most of the manifesto in a question-and-answer format, its author had clearly — and correctly — expected it to be picked up and distributed by mainstream media networks, amplifying his ideas further than ever.

“One of the sickest and most upsetting parts of this for me is that the killings, the actual terrorist attacks, are forms of propaganda for the statements,” said Mr. Feldman of the Center for Analysis of the Radical Right. “They draw attentions to their statements through their actions.”

That leaves media organizations in an ethical bind, Mr. Feldman said.

“The coverage will be wall-to-wall today,” he said, “and tomorrow it will set someone else off.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Last week’s story on the statements made by Representative Ilhan Omar, and the Democrats’ response to them, clearly resonated with readers. We got over 100 emails, covering views on all sides of the issue and coming from across the country (and even a few from around the globe).

Some readers felt that Ms. Omar’s statements, regardless of possible anti-Semitism, addressed an issue that is in dire need of serious political debate.

I am horrified that the moderate, older Dems wanted to rebuke Ms. Omar. Her comments were perhaps ill-advised, but why should she be singled out when comments made by other public figures are much more ugly and yet are let slide? People of different generations were raised with completely differing views of Israel — my generation, the baby boomers, were taught to revere the strong new state of Israel, while people now in their 20s and 30s see the damage Israel is causing the Palestinians. Ms. Omar is of that generation and also an immigrant, and must be given some slack. Above all her First Amendment rights must NOT be trampled by Democrats!

Here is an 85-year-old Jew who strongly supports Ms. Omar, and who agrees with her that the Israeli and Aipac policies are racist and anti-Arab. If Aipac was not so cash heavy, Congress would judge its policy on the merits, and it would have little weight; and, likewise, Israeli discriminatory policy towards its Arab citizens and neighbors would merit criticism and not acceptance. At my age I witnessed the Nazi policy of murder toward Jews and I had hoped that the Jewish state would know, as no one else, how wrong and muddle headed those policies were. Alas, the Jewish state seems to have learned little from the far-to-recent past.

Many others felt that Ms. Omar’s statements were plainly anti-Semitic, and that the Democratic reaction was not strong enough.

Passing a resolution condemning “all hate” in response to a specific instance of pointed anti-Semitism, especially in the midst of an undeniable and disturbing upswing in anti-Semitic attacks both globally and nationally, is like passing a resolution that “all lives matter” in response to police violence against black men; it says the exact opposite of what it purports to say.

As a lifelong Democrat, I was upset at Ilhan Omar’s blatantly anti-Semitic, age-old canard about Jewish people having loyalty to another country. And I am equally upset at my party cowering to an increasingly tyrannical minority and failing to pass a specific resolution to a specific comment. Does not Congresswoman Omar know about Goebbels and his usage of propaganda such as “the insidious international Jewish financiers,” or the danger of “Jewish penetration of law, medicine, property, and the arts.” Has she not studied history and the power of the spoken word on a national platform? No bigotry should ever come close to being tolerated. Nor should hesitancy in unequivocally condemning a specific outburst of bigotry such as displayed by Congresswoman Omar ever be tolerated as well.

And then there were those whose concerns were not the content of Ms. Omar’s statements, but the political fallout that they could have.

I applaud the enthusiasm of the congressional “newbies.” However, I say to each of them, be guided by this reality: you don’t know everything, you can’t do everything, especially all at once. You are the new kids on the block. You each need to learn how to be an effective legislator, how to communicate, how to work with other legislators, even those with whom you often disagree. Succeeding in Congress may require compromise, even with those you don’t like.

      <TEXT>INDIAN WELLS, Calif. — Serena Williams defeated Victoria Azarenka, 7-5, 6-3, in the second round of the BNP Paribas Open on Friday night.

Both players returned from maternity leave a year ago at the desert tournament. Since then, Williams has reached two Grand Slam singles finals and returned to the world’s top 10.

Azarenka is still seeking to restore order in her personal life, having been involved in a legal tussle over her young son.

Williams needed a little more than two hours to close out the match, finishing with four aces and nine double faults. She saved 11 of 15 break points.</TEXT>

Barr could and should release the report. The law, he wrote, gives “all the latitude in the world” to make the report public. Read more.

Despite all the anticipation of the Mueller report, Mr. Graham wrote, few will be happy that it is finished. His argument: Democrats will no longer be able to use the continuing investigation as a reason to wait to act against President Trump. Republicans will also be forced to reckon with the president. And Mr. Trump, who has succeeded when he has a nemesis to rally against, will find himself without a villain. Read more.

      <TEXT>As a lawyer who has studied selective-college admissions, I would like to correct a misperception about the recent college admissions scandal. The accepted applicants whose test scores and athletic abilities were fraudulently inflated did not displace average, hardworking applicants who sought to be admitted on their own academic merits.

It is no secret that elite colleges administer separate admissions tracks or niches for athletes, musicians, various ethnic groups and the children of V.I.P.s — who then compete only against one another rather than within the entire applicant pool. Therefore, by fraudulently raising their SAT or ACT scores, those applicants who had famous parents were simply making themselves more competitive vis-à-vis other V.I.P. offspring.

Similarly, the applicants with fraudulent athletic credentials got themselves placed at the top of the athletes’ admissions track. Thus, in neither case were the ordinary applicants in the general admissions pool (who are judged more or less strictly on their merits) affected by the frauds perpetrated in this case.

The recent college admissions scandal has prompted pundit after pundit to bemoan how the Ivy League is made up of wealthy, entitled students who have gotten where they are by illicit means. This is an erroneous impression.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Irony alert: As is the way in such fables, it is Akim’s perfection and obedience that attract the trouble. A girl so overprotected by her parents — who have “prepared her for nothing, exempted her from everything” — does not know how to negotiate the real world in which handsome young Kasim (Leland Fowler) is drawn to her and, worse, she to him. That everyone believes Kasim to have been “chosen” for Massassi instead sets the plot in motion, as Akim starts to wander past her boundaries, geographic and also behavioral.

Ms. Sampson uses a refreshing palette of theatrical colors to fill in the story. Mixing high school comedy and magic realism, American pop and African djembe drums, she suggests a world filled with piquant specifics yet one that remains, in essence, universal in place and time. The conflicts among adolescents, like those between parents and children, have never not been a story.

And though the inventiveness does not always pay off — the play’s Chorus is a cellphone represented in whimsical human form by Rotimi Agbabiaka — Ms. Gardiner’s well-acted and swift-moving production usually picks up the slack. On a spare, circular stage bordered by prismatic plastic walls (the set design is by Louisa Thompson), she speeds the cast from scene to scene, providing only as much visual information as necessary.

Still, with the help of Dede Ayite’s terrific costumes, we are never confused or disoriented; when Akim’s escape from her family brings her (and the others) to a fateful river, Ms. Gardiner works wonders with just scarves and bodies and the simplest of stage tricks.

Those bodies are choreographed, in that scene and in two thrilling musical sequences, by Raja Feather Kelly, bringing lift to the narrative without dispersing it. One of the numbers, a gospel-inflected barnburner in fact called “Lifted,” with lyrics by Ms. Sampson and music by Ian Scot, would be reason enough to see the show. Its beguiling refrain, led by Carla R. Stewart as the stunning Voice of the River, is: “I’m reaching for my beautiful.”

So is the play, which ends with a powerful coda that grounds its unfailing pep and familiar satire in old-fashioned (and exceptionally executed) naturalism. What was occasionally manic and overbright in the previous 100 minutes is toned so far down in the final 10 as to suggest, without words, a much subtler moral lesson.

Not that moralizing is Ms. Sampson’s point. Though she has talked about her play as being influenced by Brecht, she isn’t, on the evidence, referring to his principle of alienation, in which deliberate distancing effects prevent the audience from indulging in sentiment at the expense of instruction.

Quite the opposite: “If Pretty Hurts” is successful exactly to the extent it engages us emotionally in the moral quandary of beauty, no matter what Amirrorikah we’re looking in.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Beyond those bottom-line conclusions, Mr. Mueller’s full report has yet to be released, and it remained unclear if it ever would be. House Democrats have demanded that it be sent to them by next Tuesday, but the Justice Department outlined a longer schedule, saying that it will have its own summary ready to send to lawmakers within weeks, though not months.

So far, there are no plans to give a copy of the report to the White House in advance of any public release, according to a Justice Department official.

At the heart of the obstruction question is when a president’s use of his otherwise legitimate authority under the Constitution becomes an abuse of power. When the House Judiciary Committee approved three articles of impeachment against Mr. Nixon for covering up the Watergate burglary and other crimes, it asserted that “he knowingly misused the executive power by interfering with agencies of the executive branch,” including the F.B.I. and the Justice Department.

In effect, the result was to draw a line that subsequent presidents steered clear of, no matter how frustrated they might be at times with investigators pursuing them. To prevent a repeat of Mr. Nixon’s actions, including his order firing the Watergate special prosecutor, Congress enacted a law creating an independent counsel who would not report to the president.

But both parties grew disenchanted with independent counsels after the experience of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush during Iran-contra and Bill Clinton during Whitewater and the Monica S. Lewinsky affair, so they let the law expire. When presidents did use their pardon power in cases close to them — Mr. Bush granting clemency to Caspar W. Weinberger shortly before leaving office and Mr. Clinton doing the same with Susan McDougal in his last hours in the White House — it was considered an egregious violation of the norms.

In the absence of an independent counsel law, Mr. Mueller was appointed as a special prosecutor who still answered to the Justice Department, meaning he had less latitude, could not indict the president even if he thought it merited and could be fired by the president he was investigating, as Mr. Trump threatened to do repeatedly.</TEXT>

It was the apparent close of an investigation that has captivated the nation and cast a shadow over President Trump for nearly two years. We don’t yet know the report’s contents.

      <TEXT>GOODYEAR, Ariz. — Deep down, the players get it. When a team is simply not good enough to win, and the front office emphasizes the future over the present, the players can tell. They know their effort goes only so far.

“We always feel like we can win, and then when it’s in the media that we’re rebuilding, it’s tough; it’s almost like a fake kind of energy,” said Scooter Gennett, the second baseman for the suddenly revitalized Cincinnati Reds. “But now, we know that they expect us to win. It’s a lot better. It’s a lot more real. There’s a lot more excitement than past years.”

No team arrived at spring training this year with a bigger turnaround in expectations than the Reds. The only team in the majors with at least 90 losses in each of the last four seasons, the Reds simply decided they were tired of it.

They traded for the veteran starters Sonny Gray, Tanner Roark and Alex Wood, improving a rotation with a 4.97 earned run average since 2015, the highest in the National League in that period. They added the slugging outfielders Matt Kemp and Yasiel Puig. They also hired a new manager and 10 — yes, 10 — new coaches.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>What are the effects of being born of rape in the name of genocide? How are mothers who survived this brutal violence in Rwanda dealing with the trauma and complexities of their lives and the long-lasting, multigenerational impact of what was done to them?

In 2018, I returned to Rwanda to revisit some of the families I met 12 years before when I began a project documenting the stories of women who were raped during the 1994 genocide and the children born of those horrific encounters. The mothers have now disclosed to their children the circumstances of how they were conceived, and the children are speaking for the first time as adults , reflecting on being called “children of the killers” while they were growing up.

Between April and July 1994, an estimated 800,000 people, a vast majority of them members of the country’s Tutsi minority, were killed in the space of 100 days in the small central African country of Rwanda by Hutu militias known as Interahamwe. Thousands of Tutsi women were violently and repeatedly raped. Thousands of children were conceived during those rapes; many of their mothers contracted H.I.V./AIDS during the same brutal encounters that left them pregnant.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>And the unemployment rate fell to 3.8 percent, from 4 percent, for benign reasons. More people were working and fewer were unemployed. The proportion of adults in the work force held steady, not improving further but also not giving back recent gains.

Essentially, the labor market is finally working the way we want it to, with most of the people who want a job getting one and employers finding the need to raise pay to get those increasingly hard-to-find workers.

This is a tricky report for the Federal Reserve, however. It certainly makes its January decision to put interest rate increases on indefinite hold look like a good one. The lower trend rate of job growth implied by the new number fits the story of a slowdown in the economic expansion over all.

But the wage numbers and falling unemployment rates both point to a tight job market that could create inflation pressures down the road. The central bank’s chairman, Jerome Powell, has indicated that faster wage growth doesn’t alarm him. And there’s a good substantive case that the Fed should be cheering on faster wage growth, unless that growth shows clear signs of creating an outburst in overall inflation.

But if the February trend continues, it will be a test of those convictions, and the voices arguing that the Fed needs to resume its campaign of rate increases will become louder.

Soft job growth numbers aren’t something to fear at this level of unemployment — so long as that weak February number remains a one-time corrective to the recent trend, and not the start of something a lot worse.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE — Pope Francis, putting President Trump on notice, warned on Sunday that those who close borders “will become prisoners of the walls that they build.”

The remarks came as the pope was returning from a visit to Morocco, where he worked to further his priorities of supporting migrants and establishing closer relations between the Roman Catholic Church and moderate Islam.

Mr. Trump threatened Friday to seal off the border with Mexico and moved to cut aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to punish them for failing to stop a surge in migrant crossings into the United States.

Francis, who suggested in 2016 that Mr. Trump was “not Christian” for his belief in building walls, rather than bridges, was also asked aboard the papal airplane about the Spanish government’s efforts to keep out migrants, many of whom depart from Morocco.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Last year, two satellites the size of cereal boxes sped toward Mars as though they were on an invisible track in space. Officially called MarCO A and MarCO B, they were nicknamed Wall-E and EVE, after the animated robots from the Pixar movie, by engineers at NASA.

They were just as endearing and vulnerable as their namesakes. The satellites, known as cubesats, were sent to watch over NASA’s larger InSight spacecraft as it attempted a perilous landing on the surface of Mars at the end of November.

Constellations of small satellites like the MarCOs now orbit Earth, used by scientists, private companies, high school students and even governments seeking low-budget eyes in the skies. But never before had a cubesat traveled 300 million miles into space.

On Nov. 26, as the InSight lander touched down, its status was swiftly relayed back to Earth by the two trailing cubesats. The operation was a success, and the performance of the MarCO satellites may change the way missions operate, enabling cubesats to become deep space travelers in their own right.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The Federal Emergency Management Agency unnecessarily shared sensitive personal data of more than two million disaster victims with a contractor, subjecting that information to potential identity theft and fraud, a government memo released on Friday said.

The memo, known as a management alert and written by the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security, said the data of survivors of the 2017 California wildfires and Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria were released to an unidentified contractor.

There were no indications that the data had been compromised, the agency said in a statement on Friday night. The agency said it had worked with the contractor to scrub the unnecessary data from its computer networks.

The memo, which was dated March 15 but surfaced on Friday, found that 20 data fields were unnecessarily shared with the contractor, including details about the victims’ financial institutions, electronic funds transfer numbers and bank transit numbers. Investigators estimated 2.3 million people helped by FEMA might have been affected.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The primary suspect in the shooting aboard a Dutch tram that left three people dead and five wounded confessed on Friday to the attack, and said that he acted alone, prosecutors said.

The public prosecutor’s office has said that it intends to bring terrorism charges against the suspect, Gokmen Tanis, in the attack Monday morning in the city of Utrecht, the Netherlands, but it is also investigating whether he had other motives.

Mr. Tanis confessed in a closed court hearing on Friday, the office said — his first appearance in court since he was arrested hours after the shooting. The judge ordered him held for 14 days, the maximum allowed in an initial hearing, but pretrial detention can be extended up to 90 days.

“The 37-year-old suspect admitted to a judge the criminal facts he was suspected of. He also testified that he acted alone,” prosecutors said in a statement. “It is in the best interest of the investigation not to say anything further about his testimony.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Both Sam Sifton, the food editor of The New York Times, and I are big fans of the American Girl cookbooks. The recipes are easy for children to follow, but worthy of the family dinner table — dishes like turkey chili, rosemary roast chicken and sautéed green beans with almonds. There are eight books in the series ( which Weldon Owen began publishing in 2016), many produced in partnership with Williams Sonoma ; they include “Cooking: Recipes for Delicious Snacks, Meals &amp; More” and, coming later this year, “Cupcakes: Delicious Treats to Bake &amp; Share.” My girls loved filling and folding the vegetable dumplings from “Around the World Cookbook: Delicious Dishes from Across the Globe,” which was like a craft and a cooking project in one.

There are fewer step-by-step instructions and photos in these books, so readers will need a bit more experience, or adults will need to provide more hands-on help. But they are loaded with excellent recipes that are not dumbed down for children, which means that grown-ups will want to eat them, too. It’s disappointing that the books are marketed solely to girls, because everyone could find something to love in them.

When your children are done cleaning up the kitchen (ha!) , here are four books — more memoirs with recipes than cookbooks — they can sink their teeth into .

Two cookbooks by the chef Alice Waters — “Fanny at Chez Panisse: A Child’s Restaurant Adventures With 46 Recipes” (William Morrow Cookbooks, 1997 ) and “Fanny in France: Travel Adventures of a Chef’s Daughter, With Recipes” (Viking, 2016 ) — are full of classic recipes, beautiful watercolor illustrations and charming stories told from her daughter’s point of view.

Laura Ingalls Wilder fans love “The Little House Cookbook: Frontier Foods from Laura Ingalls Wilder’s Classic Stories” by Barbara M. Walker (Harper Collins, 1979). First published in 1979 (a revamped 40th anniversary edition was published in 2018), it contains more than 100 recipes, like pulled molasses candy and corn dodgers, alongside excerpts from the “Little House” &quot;novels.

Older kids might enjoy “Relish: My Life in the Kitchen” (First Second, 2013 ), a funny and touching graphic memoir by Lucy Knisley, a cartoonist raised by a chef and a food lover. She recounts important moments in her life by what she was eating at the time.

Each chapter ends with an illustrated recipe , like spaghetti carbonara, that just might inspire your kids to head into the kitchen and make memories of their own.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>And a relatively new strategy in limiting abortions would ban the procedure if the reason for it was Down syndrome. Utah, Arkansas, Missouri and Kentucky are considering such bills this year, which also prohibit abortions based on gender, race or color. Kentucky’s law, signed Tuesday by Gov. Matt Bevin, was temporarily blocked by a federal court judge the next day.

Ohio, Tennessee and several other states are also considering so-called trigger laws, which would immediately ban abortions if Roe v. Wade was overturned. Arkansas approved a trigger law last month.

Restricting the amount of time during a pregnancy that women have to obtain a legal abortion has long been a primary strategy of abortion opponents, though the efforts have grown more and more stringent over time.

Arkansas, which five years ago saw a court strike down its ban on abortions after 12 weeks if a heartbeat could be detected, this month narrowed the period, from 20 weeks to 18 weeks, in which abortions are permitted under state law. Asa Hutchinson, the state’s Republican governor, signed the bill into law this month.

Many of the Republican lawmakers who dominate state government in Arkansas have voted for rules tightening abortion rights this legislative session, but Dan Douglas, a Republican member of the House who described himself as “anti-abortion,” startled colleagues with the story of one of his nieces, who became pregnant last year.

Mr. Douglas said his niece had been told the fetus had no bladder or functional kidneys.

“The doctor explained to her that she could carry the child throughout the remainder of the gestation, the entire nine months, and deliver that baby alive into this world,” he said. “But once it got here, once it was delivered, it would live two to three days, and those two to three days would be miserable, excruciating, agonizing for that baby and for that mother.”

He added: “Who are we to sit in judgment of their decision?”

Mississippi, which has a single abortion clinic, often takes some of the country’s most aggressive stands against abortion rights. In November, a federal judge blocked a state law that would have banned abortions after 15 weeks.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The labels were quietly added in October, after three years of protests from Decolonize This Place, a group urging institutions to acknowledge how marginalized people were represented. The museum consulted with outside experts but not the protest group.

Amin Husain, a visual artist and member of Decolonize This Place, said the labels work on this diorama “because it honors the fact that that was there to begin with, so it references the harm that has been perpetuated over the years. And then it says, ‘We’re going to tell you how that was wrong.’”

The group has said that more needs to be done. It has asked the museum to re-evaluate other exhibits and to move a statue of Theodore Roosevelt outside the building.

“That has a Native figure and an African figure subjugated to a Roosevelt president, on a horse,” Mr. Husain said. “Put it in the museum itself, and then label it.”

Natasha Singh, 34, another visual artist and member of Decolonize This Place, said she wanted to see “complete systematic changes of the museum.”

What else in town should be changed?

A lot, Ms. Singh and Mr. Husain said. They are not alone.

When city officials discovered that there were only five statues depicting real women in public spaces, they rushed to plan at least five more.

Last year, focus turned to a statue of a 19th-century surgeon who conducted experimental operations on female slaves. It was moved from Central Park to Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, where the surgeon was buried.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The memo’s only problem, then, was that it was released. Despite the fever pitch leading up to the release, the Friday it was published was a letdown for all involved. Not only didn’t it live up to the hashtag hype, but many of its most incendiary claims were still shrouded in classified documents or reports. Even so, the reveal hardly stopped the partisan debate roiling Washington. Nunes, undeterred, attempted to keep the cycle running by hinting that additional — even more explosive — memos would be forthcoming; Democrats teased releasing a counter memo. More than a year later, those memos are now largely forgotten.

As our politics becomes increasingly tinged with elements of the conspiratorial, the great reveal becomes a potentially massive liability. Which is why, in the aftermath of the Mueller report, the spin may be just beginning.

Quinta Jurecic, managing editor of the Lawfare blog, which has been following each twist of the Mueller investigation, dubbed this scramble to tease new or upcoming revelations as “effort to keep the anticipation machine running.”

The anticipation machine shows no signs of stopping. Last week, The Wall Street Journal editorial board called for the full release of the Mueller report, including “investigative materials that accompany the report.”

“It really does feel like an effort to continue the Nunes memo model,” Jurecic told me. “Just constantly pushing for the next release, the next drip, so that the unraveling of the great conspiracy is always just around the corner.”

In the wake of Barr’s summary, a handful of Democrats and advocacy organizations are also signaling there’s more to the story around the corner, pushing for a full release of the Mueller report and its currently unknown contents. Others have simply moved their hopes to continuing investigations of the president by federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. And while the seriousness of the Southern District’s case is clear, the shift in focus to the next controversy feels very familiar.

The obsession with the Mueller Report and its author — bordering, in some cases, on celebrity worship — centered on the promise of irrefutable authority. So, too, was the focus on the former F.B.I. director’s reputation as a no-nonsense, nonpartisan, relentless pursuer of truth. At a time where partisan hackery and information warfare reign supreme, the report was a hope for something spin-proof to be held up as evidence that, at the very least, somebody could get to the truth.</TEXT>

Ogunbowale scored 12 points in the final 6 minutes 45 seconds, helping the top-seeded Fighting Irish (33-3) advance to the round of 8 of the women’s N.C.A.A. tournament for the eighth time in nine years. They will play second-seeded Stanford or 11th-seeded Missouri State in the Chicago Region final on Monday.

Ogunbowale, the Irish’s career scoring leader, surpassed her previous high of 32 points. Shepard dominated down low, and Notre Dame got a sweet repeat to go with its 12th straight win.

Chennedy Carter led Texas A&amp;M (26-8) with a season-high 35 points in another impressive N.C.A.A. performance. Carter, a sophomore guard, entered the game averaging just over 30 points in five career tournament games and left having connected again, nailing 7 of 12 3-pointers.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>From the Mueller report to the Democratic primary, it’s been a busy week in American politics. Here are some of the biggest stories you might have missed (and some links if you’d like to read further).

The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, delivered his findings on Russian interference in the 2016 election to Attorney General William P. Barr on Friday. Now the attorney general must decide how much of the report — one of the most highly anticipated documents in Washington in a generation — to make public. Here’s a little more about Mr. Barr.

A battle now looms over the executive branch’s power to keep information secret from Congress, as Mr. Barr weighs how much to disclose about the report. Democrats wasted no time demanding its immediate release.

The report will be a reckoning for the president, to be sure, but also for Congress, Democrats, Republicans, the news media and the system as a whole. It will transform the political landscape and shape the rest of the Trump presidency. Here’s a video looking at how we got here.</TEXT>

Some of the children detained under the bridge in El Paso hide their faces in their hands, shielding themselves from the blowing dust. Behind the razor wire, families sit on gravel littered with paper cups, potato chip bags and torn Mylar blankets.

“This place looks like a concentration camp and we’re not supposed to have that in America,” said David Casillas, 44, a disabled veteran who tried to donate baby food on Friday to the hundreds of migrant families peering out through the fence. Border Patrol agents turned him away.

The makeshift encampment under the bridge, where immigration officials are detaining hundreds of migrants in a military tent with little hot food, was set up last week after the main border processing center in El Paso reached up to 400 percent of its capacity in the largest influx of migrants to the United States in years.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Slavery and the continuing pattern of discrimination aren’t only an attempt to steal labor; they are an attempt to cover over a person’s soul, a whole people’s soul.

That injury shows up today as geographic segregation, the gigantic wealth gap, the lack of a financial safety net, but also the lack of the psychological and moral safety net that comes when society has a history of affirming: You belong. You are us. You are equal.

Nearly five years ago I read Ta-Nehisi Coates’s Atlantic article “The Case for Reparations,” with mild disagreement. All sorts of practical objections leapt to mind. What about the recent African immigrants? What about the poor whites who have nothing of what you would call privilege? Do we pay Oprah and LeBron?

But I have had so many experiences over the past year — sitting, for example, with an elderly black woman in South Carolina shaking in rage because the kids in her neighborhood face greater challenges than she did growing up in 1953 — that suggest we are at another moment of make-or-break racial reckoning.

Coates’s essay seems right now, especially this part: “And so we must imagine a new country. Reparations — by which I mean the full acceptance of our collective biography and its consequences — is the price we must pay to see ourselves squarely. … What I’m talking about is more than recompense for past injustices — more than a handout, a payoff, hush money, or a reluctant bribe. What I’m talking about is a national reckoning that would lead to spiritual renewal.”

We’re a nation coming apart at the seams, a nation in which each tribe has its own narrative and the narratives are generally resentment narratives. The African-American experience is somehow at the core of this fragmentation — the original sin that hardens the heart, separates Americans from one another and serves as model and fuel for other injustices.

The need now is to consolidate all the different narratives and make them reconciliation and possibility narratives, in which all feel known. That requires direct action, a concrete gesture of respect that makes possible the beginning of a new chapter in our common life. Reparations are a drastic policy and hard to execute, but the very act of talking about and designing them heals a wound and opens a new story.

      <TEXT>Mr. Moskowitz started his journalism career early. He edited campus publications as a student, first at New York University and then at the University of Chicago, and covered sports for an Army newspaper while stationed at Fort Benning, Ga. He would later tell friends that his time in the segregated South led him to take on racial equality as a cause.

He earned a bachelor’s degree from the University of Chicago and enrolled in a master’s program there but dropped out after getting married. Years later, he asked the university if his books — he wrote seven altogether — could qualify as a thesis. The university granted him a master of arts degree in 2008.

After college, he worked as a copy boy at The Chicago Sun before landing a reporting job at the International News Service. He later worked for Reuters and Advertising Age, and for 15 years wrote a business column, “The Money Tree,” for The San Francisco Chronicle.

Mr. Levering, his longtime co-author, said Mr. Moskowitz always saw himself as a reporter.

“He was skeptical of ideologues of any sort,” Mr. Levering said in a phone interview. “He didn’t buy that bosses were all bad and workers were all good. He was a true journalist.”

That instinct served him well when an editor at the publishing house Addison-Wesley suggested that Mr. Moskowitz and Mr. Levering write a book on the 100 best places to work. They were not immediately taken with the idea; Mr. Moskowitz later said that they “weren’t sure they could find 100 worthy workplaces.”

Nor could they easily find information on the companies they were considering for the list. So they hit the road, visiting companies and asking workers two basic questions: “What makes this a great place to work?” and “What would make it a better place?”

This labor-intensive approach was risky: Mr. Levering recalled that they put the travel expenses on their personal credit cards once their advance ran out. Fortunately, the book was a hit.

A voracious reader with a near-perfect memory for names and dates, Mr. Moskowitz remained active into his final years. He helped compile his final “best companies” list for Fortune in 2015.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>A curator who accused MoMA PS 1 of gender, pregnancy and caregiver discrimination has settled the claim she brought against the museum saying it had rescinded a job offer upon learning she had recently given birth.

Nikki Columbus, who is also an art editor, filed the claim in July 2018 with the New York City Commission on Human Rights. The settlement, made public by the law firm that represented Ms. Columbus, Emery Celli Brinckerhoff &amp; Abady, includes financial compensation for Ms. Columbus as well an agreement by the contemporary art museum in Queens to update its written policies designed to protect women, working parents and other caregivers who apply for jobs or work there.

“What happened to me was wrong and clearly against the law,” Ms. Columbus said in a statement on Tuesday. “I decided to speak out in order to protect other women at MoMA PS1 and beyond.”

The financial terms were not disclosed, but Ms. Columbus said in an interview that she made it a point that her agreement not bar her from discussing other details of the case.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>After the wedding feast, Ramsay has his men order Theon to bring “Arya” to his bedchamber. There, he makes Theon cut off her clothes and ultimately participate in the wedding night rape; Theon is also raped himself. In the books, Theon/Reek is much more damaged at this point, believe it or not — Ramsay had also shattered his teeth and relieved him of other body parts.

From there, things only get worse. People throughout Winterfell — including the northern lords who came for the wedding and are now snowbound — can hear Jeyne’s sobbing, which Theon describes as “too painful to endure.” The rumor mill is fueled by reports that “Arya” is kept naked and chained to a bedpost. Guards speculate why she needs a hot bath every night. The serving women see the bruises, and those who accompany Theon to rescue her see teeth marks. So abused is the poor girl that she thinks the rescue must be another trick. Eventually, the rescue succeeds, and Theon and “Arya” jump off the battlements of Winterfell together.

Sansa’s experience on the show, then, has been simplified and sanitized. She is spared some of the sadism and torture, and she doesn’t suffer a psychological collapse. Fewer people die on Sansa’s behalf and even if many did, they weren’t expending their efforts to save a fraud. In the books, Sansa is relatively safe and sound in the Eyrie, although she’s still in disguise and involved in various political machinations. Apparently, the showrunners thought giving Sansa the fake Arya plot would allow her to play a bigger role in the story and that Theon’s redemption arc should involve someone the audience cares about. This didn’t work.

This week, readers wanted to know more about Stannis’s red priestess.

Melisandre, in the beginning of Season 6, reveals herself as an old woman/creature. I find it curious, especially since she comes from Asshai where all manner of dark and creepy things dwell. What is the nature of her being? What type of creature is Melisandre? — Noelani Clough

Is Melisandre’s youthful appearance real or just an illusion? If it’s just an illusion, wouldn’t Stannis literally feel the truth? And wouldn’t she slip during the exhausting attempts to bring Jon back? — Alma Southmayd

Melisandre is quite the mysterious woman, and that’s on purpose — part of her power derives from keeping us in the dark about how effortless or difficult her sorcery is. But we do know a little. Her glamour spell is made of “shadow and suggestion,” she claims in the books. “The wearer’s essence does not change, only his seeming,” which means, yes, Stannis should feel the truth of her physiology. But would he want to? “Men see what they expect to see,” she says. Meaning, if Stannis thinks he’s having sex with a younger woman, he’s going to disregard sensations telling him otherwise that could ruin the moment. And yes, magic can be exhausting, but not in the way you’re thinking. Mel sometimes feels like the ruby is burning her (“she feared her own flesh might start to smoke and blacken”), so perhaps she wants to take it off, but she chooses when to seek relief.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Slate, the online publication known for counterintuitive analysis and its many podcasts, has chosen a specialist in narrative journalism as its next editor in chief.

On Wednesday, the company announced that it had given the job to Jared Hohlt, a veteran of New York magazine. He succeeds Julia Turner, who left Slate in October to become a deputy managing editor of The Los Angeles Times. Lowen Liu, formerly Slate’s managing editor and deputy editor, has served as the publications’s acting editor in chief since Ms. Turner’s departure.

Mr. Hohlt, 47, is scheduled to start April 1. During his 18 years at New York, he served in a variety of roles, including editorial director and top editor of the print version of the magazine. In 2016, the magazine won in the general excellence category at the National Magazine Awards. For most of his time at New York, he worked under the editor in chief Adam Moss, who announced his resignation in January after a 15-year run.

Mr. Hohlt got his start at Slate as an editorial assistant two decades ago, when, he recalled in an interview, at least one contributor insisted on using a typewriter. “It was a journalistic training ground for me,” he said.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>AUSTIN, Tex. — Surprises abounded at this year’s South by Southwest film festival, with movies featuring depraved demons, devilish doppelgängers and sadistic senseis all doing despicable things. And yet, one of the most gasp-worthy moments was hearing the tween actor Jacob Tremblay use the F-word in the first five minutes of “Good Boys.” It wouldn’t be the only time in this comedy about a wild day in the life of a few sixth-graders, and it was one of several breakout titles worth knowing about as the film portion of the festival comes to a close on Saturday.

“If I’m being honest, I am shocked and appalled,” Tremblay joked during the post-screening Q.&amp; A., and added referring to his director Gene Stupnitsky, “Gene told me this was going to be a PG-rated family movie. He lied.”

The movie was right at home at a festival that has turned into something of a testing ground for the hit potential of Hollywood comedies. The audience applauded the comic timing of Tremblay and his co-stars, Brady Noon and the scene-stealing Keith L. Williams, and that positive reaction along with a recently released red-band trailer featuring one of the movie’s producers, Seth Rogen, has fueled social-media interest. “Good Boys” opens nationwide in August.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>If you know people by the company they keep, sometimes you know stars by the company they beat.

When Judy Holliday won a 1950 Oscar for her comic tour de force in “Born Yesterday,” her rivals included Gloria Swanson in “Sunset Boulevard” and Bette Davis in “All About Eve.” Not too shabby.

Seven years later, Holliday landed a best actress Tony for the musical “Bells Are Ringing” — over Julie Andrews in “My Fair Lady” and Ethel Merman in “Happy Hunting.”

And yet Holliday is a household name mainly among TCM devotees nowadays, maybe because of her short résumé: She made relatively few films, appeared only in a handful of Broadway plays and recorded just two albums before succumbing to breast cancer at 42, in 1965.

Willy Holtzman’s play with music “Smart Blonde” — the actress disguised her intelligence by playing ditzes — begins in late 1964. Holliday (Andréa Burns, alternatively piquant and affecting) is in a studio, trying to lay down vocals for a record she’s making with her boyfriend, the jazz saxophonist Gerry Mulligan (Mark Lotito). But her voice keeps cracking, and “What’s the Rush” just isn’t happening.</TEXT>

Chen’s gaze settled on an article about a classmate, Sophie Ascheim, the executive producer of “Period. End of Sentence,” which three days earlier had won an Oscar in the documentary short category. Ascheim, a member of Chen’s residential college, was already back on campus; he had seen her that morning as they were rushing off to class.

“People do crazy impressive things here,” Chen said. “Then they come back and they’re normal.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>From Michael Cohen’s testimony to the Trump-Kim Jong-un summit, it’s been a busy week in American politics. Here are some of the biggest stories you might have missed (and some links if you’d like to read further).

More allegations and revelations about the president.

In a daylong hearing before the House Oversight and Reform Committee on Wednesday, Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s former personal lawyer, offered a damning portrayal of life inside the president’s orbit — where, he said, advisers sacrifice integrity for proximity to power.

Accusations by Mr. Cohen, such as the president’s alleged knowledge of the hacked Democratic emails released by WikiLeaks, could create new legal issues for Mr. Trump. His testimony also revived questions about whether the president broke the law by failing to disclose that he had footed the bill for a hush payment to a pornographic film actress.

Internal memos revealed Thursday show that Mr. Trump ordered his chief of staff to grant Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser, a top-secret security clearance last year, overruling concerns from intelligence officials. The memos contradict previous statements made by the president, who said he had no role in Mr. Kushner’s clearance.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>SITTWE, Myanmar — The blood was flowing again, as it has so often, in Rakhine State, where the jungle of the Mayu hills meets the muddy flats of the Bay of Bengal: Ethnic militants ambushed four police bases on Myanmar’s Independence Day in January, killing 14 officers.

The Myanmar Army responded with its customary ferocity toward what it termed a “terrorist” group.

The insurgents would be “crushed,” added Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate and Myanmar’s civilian leader. Fatal clashes continued through February, and a 7-year-old child was killed in the crossfire. On Wednesday, two police officers were killed by a land mine blamed on the militants.

Rakhine, like Sarajevo or Darfur, has become a global byword for ethnic cleansing, a place where in 2017 members of the country’s Buddhist majority carried out the mass expulsion of the Muslim Rohingya ethnic group, an act accompanied by widespread rape, killing and the burning of entire villages that United Nations officials called genocide.

The Myanmar military used a deadly raid by Rohingya militants on police posts and an army base as the excuse for the rampage that ensued.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The bond market smells a recession. On Friday, stock investors caught a whiff, too.

Economic forecasters and Wall Street traders have been watching for months as interest rates on long-term United States government bonds have dropped toward the rates on short-term debt.

Investors normally demand higher yields to buy longer-term bonds, and when those long-term yields decline it can signal a slowdown in economic growth.

On rare occasions , long-term yields can actually fall below yields on short-term bonds — a “yield curve inversion” in the parlance of the markets. Such unusual occurrences have preceded every recession over the last 60 years.

And it happened on Friday.

The inversion followed a sharp decline on yields on long-term Treasury bonds this week after the Federal Reserve decided on Wednesday to leave interest rates unchanged and signaled that it was unlikely to raise rates through the end of 2019.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>MOBRIDGE, S.D. — Harold Labrensz spent much of his 89-year life farming and ranching the rolling Dakota plains along the Missouri River. His family figured he would die there, too.

But late last year, the nursing home in Mobridge, S.D., that cared for Mr. Labrensz announced that it was shutting down after a rocky history of corporate buyouts, unpaid bills and financial ruin. It had become one of the many nursing homes across the country that have gone out of business in recent years as beds go empty, money troubles mount and more Americans seek to age in their own homes.

For Mr. Labrensz, though, the closure amounted to an eviction order from his hometown. His wife, Ramona, said she could not find any nursing home nearby to take him, and she could not help him if he took a fall at home. So one morning in late January, as a snowstorm whited out the prairie, Mr. Labrensz was loaded into the back of a small bus and sent off on a 220-mile road trip to a nursing home in North Dakota.

“He didn’t want to go,” said Mrs. Labrensz, 87, who made the trip with her husband. “When we stopped for gas, he said, ‘Turn this thing around.’ ”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Six new paperbacks to check out this week.

WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE? Essays, by Marilynne Robinson. (Picador, $18.) In a collection of lectures and other writing, the Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist and critic dwells on the current political and cultural climate, and defends the importance of the public university. Above all, Robinson returns to prominent themes across her work: the moral dimension of intellectual development, and the relationship between faith and reason.

THE LOST GIRLS OF CAMP FOREVERMORE, by Kim Fu. (Mariner, $14.99.) An overnight kayaking trip becomes tragic one summer at a camp in the Pacific Northwest, and reverberates throughout the lives of the campers for years to come. Our reviewer, Lisa Ko, praised the novel, writing that Fu is “a propulsive storyteller, using clear and cutting prose to move seamlessly through time.”

ASK ME ABOUT MY UTERUS: A Quest to Make Doctors Believe in Women’s Pain, by Abby Norman. (Bold Type, $16.99.) Norman is one of millions of women across the world with endometriosis, and uses her experience as a jumping-off point to argue that women’s discomfort is routinely dismissed by doctors. Along the way, she interweaves revealing anecdotes — spanning everything from Freud to recent scientific debates.

DOWN THE RIVER UNTO THE SEA, by Walter Mosley. (Mulholland/Little, Brown, $15.99.) Joe King Oliver was once one of the N.Y.P.D.’s top investigators, until he was framed for sexual assault and imprisoned. Years later, he’s trying to recover from the horrors he faced in jail and running a private detective agency with his teenage daughter, when he hears from the woman who accused him: She found religion and wants to clear her conscience. King then begins the tricky process of looking into who wanted him off the police force — and why.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>HOUSTON — In his State of the Union address, President Trump surprised Congress by asking for a “commitment to eliminate the H.I.V. epidemic in the United States within 10 years.” I’m a physician who specializes in H.I.V. and AIDS prevention in a city with one of the highest infection rates in the country, so that’s music to my ears. But the president needs to know that we’re going to fail if we don’t start working much harder.

After nearly 40 years, we finally have the biomedical tools and the public health strategies to end the H.I.V. epidemic in America. The winning strategy goes like this: Increase the number of people who get tested for H.I.V., and start those who test positive on antiretroviral therapy as soon as possible, which helps prevent transmission of the virus. Those who test negative but are vulnerable to infection because of sexual activity should take pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, the daily drug regimen that reduces the risk of getting H.I.V.

The tragedy is that those tools are sitting on the shelf in many parts of the country, especially the South, where H.I.V. rates are still rising among some groups and where AIDS disproportionately afflicts African-Americans. Just this week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the “progress in H.I.V. prevention has stalled.”

Big cities on both coasts — where AIDS was concentrated when it was officially recognized as a health condition in the early 1980s — have deftly managed the disease. San Francisco was once ground zero, yet in 2017 new H.I.V. diagnoses there fell to 221, a record low. The city’s Department of Public Health credits PrEP and a rapid-start program that gets those who test positive for H.I.V. into care within five days.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“One hundred percent, yeah, man, America First, bro,” he said in a telephone interview from the Washington area.

His father, Dr. Fitaihi, 54, had founded a private hospital in Jidda and became a well-known motivational speaker. He was among more than 200 wealthy Saudis arrested in November 2017 in a roundup that was portrayed as a crackdown on corruption. But Mr. Fitaihi said his father had told the family he did not know of any allegations or evidence against him.

“There is no reason whatsoever,” the son said.

Most of the others detained at the same time as Dr. Fitaihi have since been released. But his son said the former detainees and their families are afraid to talk to one another, and his family believes the government has warned them to avoid contact with one another as a condition of their release. “Everybody is in a bubble,” he said.

Mr. Fitaihi said he had been visiting his father’s medical office in Jidda when a group of plainclothes security officers came for the doctor. The son said he received special permission from the Saudi authorities to leave the kingdom last year in order to look after the family’s assets abroad, since their wealth inside the kingdom had been frozen.

Much of the information that the family has learned about Dr. Fitaihi since his arrest — including the account of his torture — came from a few days in January 2018 when he was allowed out of prison to visit a son in a hospital after surgery. Dr. Fitaihi “was half his size and very emotional,” Mr. Fitaihi said.

The family initially hoped that the Saudi authorities would quickly release Dr. Fitaihi on their own, or that quiet appeals behind the scenes would secure his release.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>He carried Michigan in 2016, needs to win it again in 2020 and can expect supporters in the western part of the state to provide an enthusiastic endorsement of his claim that he was fully exonerated of allegations of collusion and obstruction of justice by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. In fact, he was explicitly not exonerated of the obstruction charges, according to Attorney General William P. Barr’s summary of the investigation by Mr. Mueller.

“This president seems to be operating on ‘how do I make my smaller supporters more intensified’ as opposed to ‘how do I get more supporters?’” said Matthew Dowd, a former top political adviser to President George W. Bush. “He’s using the power of the presidency, instead of trying to overcome division, he is trying to harden the division.”

Neither the White House nor the Trump campaign responded to questions seeking comment about his travels.

But an examination of Mr. Trump’s calendar every day since he was sworn into office, using the data compiled at factba.se, shows that the president has mainly spoken to audiences who already agree with him, with the exception of his trips responding to natural disasters.

According to factba.se, he has spent 82.5 percent of his presidency at the White House and has visited a property he owns on 224 out of 796 days, or 28.1 percent, he has been in office. He has visited 38 states, but that masks the extent to which he has concentrated his time in states that voted for him for president: nine visits to Missouri and West Virginia, eight to Texas and North Carolina, for example. Heavily Democratic Maryland, for instance, is one of his most frequently visited states, but that is because he travels from Andrews Air Force Base, located in the state.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>MAPUTO, Mozambique — The fierce winds and torrential rains slammed into three of the poorest countries on earth, upending the lives of more than one million people in a matter of minutes.

Then the floods from Cyclone Idai came and stayed.

Nearly a week after southern Africa was hit by one of the worst natural disasters in decades, it was all rescue workers could do to try to reach the victims, let alone count them.

People were clinging to trees, desperately waiting for some form of rescue. Around them, the remnants of homes sat in piles, collapsed as easily as if they had been houses of cards. Hundreds of thousands of people in Mozambique alone were displaced.

And everywhere there was a vast inland sea where once there had been land.

“This is now a water operation,” a fellow aid worker told Matthew Cochrane, a spokesman for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The stalemate between Mr. Kraft’s high-priced legal team and law enforcement officials in Palm Beach County hinges on two things: The terms of a proposed deal and the status of any video evidence of Mr. Kraft.

Last week, prosecutors offered to drop the two misdemeanor charges against Mr. Kraft, but the proposed deal required him to admit that he would have been found guilty at trial on the charges. Many defendants in these types of cases routinely accept such terms to avoid the cost and potential embarrassment of fighting them.

But Mr. Kraft is not backing down. His legal team and prosecutors spent much of last week trying to get prosecutors to alter the terms of the deal offered to him and 24 other men who were similarly accused of soliciting prostitution at a massage parlor in Jupiter, Fla., called Orchids of Asia Day Spa. But Mr. Kraft and many of the other men are unwilling to admit guilt because they believe the police mishandled aspects of the case.

They contend that a search warrant was improperly obtained to install secret cameras inside the massage parlor. According to the police, the video shows Mr. Kraft and the other men soliciting sex. The pretext for that warrant was predicated on the existence of human trafficking at that massage parlor, something that the police have not yet proven and that Mr. Kraft’s lawyers insist did not exist.

At the same time, Mr. Kraft and 14 of the other men last week filed a motion asking the court to ensure that all evidence in the case, particularly the surveillance video, be kept private to avoid bias among potential jurors. That request prompted an unusual response from Sheriff William Snyder of Martin County. He said the video evidence would most likely be made public once the case ends.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The Tennessee House of Representatives passed a bill on Thursday that would ban abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected, mimicking laws in other states that have been struck down by the courts and drawing the criticism of both advocates and opponents of abortion rights.

The measure, House Bill 77, would tightly restrict the window of time within which a woman could seek an abortion, because a fetal heartbeat can be detected as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. That is before many women even realize they are pregnant.

The bill, which is part of a category of anti-abortion measures called “heartbeat bills,” will now be referred to the State Senate, where abortion rights groups have said they hope to derail it. If it were to be passed by the Senate and signed into law, it would become one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country.

Hours after the vote in Tennessee, the Georgia House of Representatives passed a similar bill that would outlaw abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected. The state’s governor, Brian Kemp, a Republican, has indicated that he will sign the legislation, House Bill 481, if it passes in the State Senate.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The launch was also an important step for the goals of Elon Musk, who founded SpaceX in 2002 and who says the objective of the company is to send people to space and eventually Mars. “It's been 17 years to get to this point,” said Mr. Musk.

He described himself as emotionally exhausted. “But it worked,” Mr. Musk said of Crew Dragon. “So far.”

To date, the company has sent into space only satellites and cargo (and one Tesla sports car). “We still haven't launched anyone yet, but hopefully, we will later this year,” Mr. Musk said. “So that would definitely be a culmination of a long dream for a lot of people, me and a lot of people at SpaceX.”

For the past eight years, NASA has been paying for rides on Russian spacecraft to get its astronauts to and from the International Space Station. Instead of developing and operating its own replacement for the space shuttles, NASA has instead turned to private companies to provide that service. In 2014, the space agency awarded two contracts, to SpaceX and to Boeing.

The mission that launched Saturday, known as Demo-1, is an end-to-end test of the spacecraft from launch to docking at the International Space Station to re-entering over the United States and splashing down in the Atlantic Ocean.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“I suppose that was ‘dropping out’ before most people started doing it routinely,” she told The Globe. “I was depressed. Fed up! With everything!”

She returned to the states, took a high school equivalency exam and was accepted at Radcliffe, where she specialized in languages and from which she graduated in 1964.

She went back to Europe in 1964, this time to Stratford-on-Avon, England, where she celebrated the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare’s birth.

The following year she moved to London, where she stayed for the rest of her life. She returned every year to visit her father — often in Hot Springs, Va., where his grandfather had been an early investor in the Homestead, a palatial hotel resort now called The Omni Homestead. Rachel spent summers there as a child with her parents and siblings. In addition to her sister, she is survived by her brother, Daniel.

Ms. Ingalls had been writing since she was a child. Her sister said she had always carried a notebook and was constantly scribbling down her thoughts. She collected the scraps of paper in a bag and emptied them out when she was ready to write.

Her first book, “Theft” (1970), won the Authors’ Club First Novel Award, even though the award is intended for British writers. Still, she remained largely unknown, especially in the United States.

In 1986, to her utter surprise — and to that of much of the publishing world — the British Book Marketing Council named “Mrs. Caliban” one of the 20 best novels by living American writers after World War II. That put Ms. Ingalls in the exalted company of Toni Morrison (“Song of Solomon”), Philip Roth (“The Ghost Writer”) and Thomas Pynchon (“Gravity’s Rainbow”). John Updike was also on the list (“Rabbit, Run”); he was a particular fan of “Mrs. Caliban,” calling it “an impeccable parable.”

“I was astounded,” she told The Globe. “The main thing to me is just being published. And really, after that, I don’t care.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>When my daughter got cancer, I began hoarding ketchup packets and digital thermometers.

Gillian was 11 when we learned the lingering knee pain was osteosarcoma in her right femur. The treatment protocol for this rare bone disease was a nine-month course of aggressive chemotherapy. Each of the almost-weekly infusions required at least a three-night hospital stay.

My husband, Kyle, and I took turns sleeping by her side. Her 13-year-old sister, Allison, gave up time with friends to have dinner with her. Sharing a room with another patient’s family meant twice as many late-night awakenings and no privacy.

Gillian was the model patient. She endured painful blisters on her feet, and when she had to throw up she made sure to use a bin so nurses wouldn’t have to change her sheets. She entertained herself with books, origami paper and sketchpads. This wasn’t surprising. Even as a toddler, she had designed independent projects so I could build my life coaching practice. Once while I worked, she manufactured a pair of spectacles from Kleenex and water.

But, when I crawled into her hospital bed to snuggle and kiss her good night, she regularly sobbed quietly in my arms. As much as I tried, I couldn’t stop my tears from trickling down my cheeks onto her soft bald head.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Our understanding is that the attorney general and his deputies now have a long weekend of reading ahead of them. They have to go through the report, see what’s there, digest it, and then figure out what to do with it. How much of it should be made public, how much of it should be given to Congress, and how much of it should remain secret.

Barr is in this incredibly difficult spot, because he has to figure out how much information to share with the public and Congress in a way that is enough to leave people convinced that this investigation was done thoroughly and based on following the facts. But he has to protect the president from disclosures about him that the public may be interested in, that his political enemies may want to know, but that has no bearing on the actual criminal investigation that was done.

Yes. If Mueller says the president didn’t break the law, then Barr has to figure out how much information to give to Congress so that Congress takes those findings seriously. The problem is Barr is in a very difficult spot politically, because the Democrats have already concluded the president did something wrong. So if Barr learns from Mueller that there’s no criminality on the president, how does Barr then win over those Democrats and show them that Mueller truly made a decision based on the facts? How much of what the investigation found does he have to give to the Hill? In a normal criminal investigation, all of that information would not become public because the Justice Department would want to protect the individual who they have found did not commit a crime. But this situation is different, because a lot of people do think the president committed a crime. So how do you show the Democrats and the rest of the country that hey, look, this is what Mueller found. He only found X, Y, and Z. And if we wanted to make a case, he would have needed to have uncovered these other things, which he did not. And that’s why we’re confident with his findings.

Well, how much of the evidence that Mueller uncovered should go to Congress? What should be told to Congress? Should Congress be told explicitly, look, Mueller believes the president violated these laws, and here’s the evidence to back it up? But what if some of that evidence has been obtained from a grand jury? The Justice Department can’t just hand over grand jury information to Congress. What if the information is classified? They’re not going to want to hand over classified information to Congress. They think Congress leaks like a sieve.

When will we know more? Barr and his deputies will go through this, and I don’t know — sometime in the next few days, sometime in the next few weeks. It may be a difficult process to unbraid. Mueller has been rummaging around the president’s life for 22 months. We don’t have clarity into everything Mueller’s found. What if Barr looks at it and says, eh, Mueller thinks he violated this law and that law. But actually, I don’t think he has it. Maybe there’s not enough there. Maybe Barr disagrees with what Mueller has found, simply on a legal basis. The other thing is that Barr only really gets one shot to get it right. Whatever he goes out the door with in terms of handing over information to Congress, he’s got to have it right. He’s not going to have a second chance to say, well, you know, I gave you that stuff. But like, meh, maybe it’s not what I thought it was. Or, oh, let’s give you more. He has to get it right the first time. Otherwise, he’ll look like he’s waffling.

Barr clearly knows Congress is going to jump up and down until it is satisfied with the information that it wants about this investigation. He can drag that out and probably lose it one way or another, either in the court of public opinion or in the actual courts. So he probably just wants to get it over with as soon as possible. He knows this has been an enormous weight on the country, and that the sooner it is resolved, the sooner the country can move on.

I don’t know. I mean, the number of people who will have access to this document will be very small. And they will know that if there are a lot of leaks about this, then the president can start to raise questions about what’s really going on. It will look nefarious. The Democrats will get their backs up and say, well, if this stuff is leaking out, why can’t we have access to it? They will know that their lives will be much more difficult if there are leaks here. Obviously, you could come up with a scenario where someone working on the investigation is frustrated that the Justice Department has decided to go one way or the other on the report, and they think, ah, screw it, I’m going to make this public. But my guess is they have gone to great lengths to ensure that this is heavily protected.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>ABUJA, Nigeria — When a Nigerian presidential candidate landed in the United States in January after years of being subject to a visa ban because of corruption allegations, he had a team of Western consultants and lobbyists to thank for the warm American welcome.

One of those who helped was Riva Levinson, who was mentored in the art of political consulting by Paul Manafort, the former chairman of President Trump’s presidential campaign, sentenced this month to more than seven years in prison for a host of crimes.

Ms. Levinson, who now has her own firm, KRL International, is among the many American political consultants with ties to President Trump who have become regular fixtures in African political campaigns, seizing on the region’s turn toward democracy.

For decades, countries in sub-Saharan Africa changed governments through coups that left military juntas in charge. But increasingly, in places like Nigeria, elections are supposed to determine the will of the people, though sometimes they are not fully free and fair.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Attorney General William P. Barr told congressional leaders in a letter late Friday that the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has concluded his inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election and delivered a report to the Department of Justice.

See the letter here and read a transcript below.

[What’s next? We break it down as well as the major moments in the case. And here’s the latest analysis on Trump and the Mueller report.]

I write to notify you pursuant to 28 C.F.R. § 600.9(a)(3) that Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III has concluded his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and related matters. In addition to this notification, the Special Counsel regulations require that I provide you with “a description and explanation of instances (if any) in which the Attorney General” or acting Attorney General “concluded that a proposed action by a Special Counsel was so inappropriate or unwarranted under established Departmental practices that it should not be pursued.” 28 C.F.R. § 600.9(a)(3). There were no such instances during the Special Counsel’s investigation.

The Special Counsel has submitted to me today a “confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions” he has reached, as required by 28 C.F.R. § 600.8(c). I am reviewing the report and anticipate that I may be in a position to advise you of the Special Counsel’s principal conclusions as soon as this weekend.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Calling it a “mere pretext” for sinister intent, Russia vetoed an American resolution in the United Nations Security Council on Thursday for new elections and unhindered distribution of humanitarian aid in Venezuela.

It was the latest clash in a Cold War-style quarrel playing out amid the chaos unfolding in Venezuela, once Latin America’s most prosperous country.

From the outset, there was little hope the American measure would surmount opposition from Russia, which proposed a rival resolution that was roundly rejected by the Security Council.

China, another permanent member of the council, also opposed the American resolution.

The Kremlin has aligned closely with President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela even as the United States and about 50 other countries, many of them in Latin America and Europe, have renounced relations with him.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>In Queensland, for example, lawyers for the Women’s Legal Center and other activists have been lobbying the legislature to include victims’ rights in a bill that lawmakers are considering.

In Tasmania and in the Northern Territory, a campaign called #LetHerSpeak aims to overturn state laws that make it illegal to identify a victim of sexual assault even if the victim consents.

New South Wales is also studying how consent laws work, in the wake of outrage over the case of Saxon Mullins, who said she was raped in a Sydney alleyway, only to have the man involved be acquitted because even though she didn’t consent, he thought she did.

And yet, at this point, there has been little progress. Systemic change is slow, and some women told me that they aren’t sure how much to expect from a male-dominated system that is insular and often overconfident in its own rectitude.

In the case of Cardinal Pell, the issue was secrecy: One judge and a suppression order defined for the world how much could be known about the most senior Vatican official to ever be tried for sexually abusing children.

But, more broadly, the invisibility of the process can hide a multitude of sins.

What’s often invisible to those without direct experience of these kinds of cases, many women said, is that the courts often feel discriminatory rather than fair.

“I used to work at the women’s center in Cairns in the ’80s, and one of the things I’ve found was that the women were always ostracized once they went into court,” Ms. Prince told me. “It didn’t matter if it was domestic violence, rape, or a mom trying to get custody of the kids.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>STOCKHOLM — On a recent Friday night, the Swedish rapper Silvana Imam appeared on stage at Annexet, a concert venue in the south side of Stockholm, dressed like a comic-book villain. Her face hidden by a black mask studded with spikes, she dragged a metal baseball bat across the stage to the loud cheers of her mostly female audience.

The menacing display was a theatrical embodiment of the gleefully confrontational role Imam, the lesbian daughter of refugees, has come to play in Swedish pop culture. Imam, whose mother is Lithuanian and father Syrian, is one of the country’s best-known hip-hop artists, and a symbol of the counterreaction to the rise of right-wing populism in Scandinavia’s most populous country.

When the mask came off, Imam, 32, launched into “I Min Zon” (“In My Zone”), a languid, withering song from her first EP, in which she rails against racism and sexism in the country. “Fifteen million people in the world are named Mohamed,” she rapped in Swedish, “but whose name do they want to see on the résumé?”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WASHINGTON — A dozen Republicans joined Senate Democrats on Thursday to overturn President Trump’s declaration of a national emergency at the southwestern border, arguing that the president had exceeded his powers in trying to build a border wall over Congress’s objections.

The 59-to-41 vote on a measure already approved by the House set up the first veto of Mr. Trump’s presidency. It was not a big enough margin to override his promised veto, but Congress has now voted for the first time to block a presidential emergency declaration — and on one of the core promises that animated Mr. Trump’s political rise.

“Never before has a president asked for funding, Congress has not provided it, and the president then has used the National Emergencies Act of 1976 to spend the money anyway,” said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee. “Our nation’s founders gave to Congress the power to approve all spending so that the president would not have too much power. This check on the executive is a crucial source of our freedom.”

It was the latest sign that the cautious Republican majority in the Senate, spurred on by a far bolder Democrat-controlled House, was beginning to reassert its authority with a president who had gone virtually unchecked during his first two years in office.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>A teenager in Atlanta was fatally shot on Friday after knocking on the door of an apartment he mistakenly thought was the one he shared with his girlfriend, the authorities said.

The teenager, Omarian Banks, approached the apartment at about 12:30 a.m. on Friday and began knocking on the door under the impression that his girlfriend was inside, the police said. After Mr. Banks, 19, walked away, a man inside appeared on his second-floor balcony to confront him and opened fire.

The man suspected of being the gunman, Darryl I. Bynes, 32, has been charged with murder.

Mr. Banks’s girlfriend, Zsakeria Mathis, 23, had been waiting for Mr. Banks because he had called and asked her to open the door. The conversation lasted three seconds.

“I went to open the door and he wasn’t standing right there,” Ms. Mathis said on Sunday. Ms. Mathis could not see Mr. Banks so she started walking out of her apartment and soon heard faint voices.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>But climate change is not “extremely out of the mainstream.” Concern about climate change in the United States is the highest it has ever been. On the heels of a deadly wildfire season supercharged by climate change and a report by 13 federal agencies finding global warming poses a serious threat to the economy, Americans are more convinced than ever that emissions from tailpipes and smokestacks are having an impact on the planet.

In many ways the Green New Deal, with its call to power the country entirely on wind, solar and other zero-carbon energy and ensuring the United States eliminates as much carbon pollution as it creates by about 2030, has injected a new enthusiasm for tackling the problem: Every Democratic presidential candidate has been pressed on his or her support of the plan, and it has helped propel climate change into a top-tier issue for 2020.

But it also has created awkward moments for moderate Democrats. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, for example, was excoriated and mocked on “Saturday Night Live” after she told a group of visiting school children that she opposed the Green New Deal because it wasn’t practical and “there’s no way to pay for it.” Ms. Feinstein has a 90 percent lifetime rating from the League of Conservation Voters, which rates lawmakers on their environmental votes and policies, and has sponsored major climate change legislation for more than 20 years.

Joseph Pinion, a Republican political consultant who advocates a carbon tax, criticized Green New Deal supporters for making it a purity test of support for to address climate change. He called the resolution “possibly the largest setback in terms of getting Republicans to the table certainly in my lifetime.”

By packaging efforts to curb emissions with unrelated issues like promises of a federal job guarantee, vacation pay for all Americans and a single-payer health care system, he said the Green New Deal feeds the belief among conservatives that Democrats are using climate change as a cover to enact a broadly liberal economic agenda.

“The problem with the Green New Deal is that it unifies Republicans,” Mr. Pinion said. “From your never-Trumpers to your Trump skeptics to your Trumportunists, all of these individuals are united in the idea that the policies of a Green New Deal would be disastrous for America.”

But polling on the plan is strong, at least among Democrats. Data commissioned by environmental groups in early primary states found 74 percent of likely primary voters reacted favorably when presented the Green New Deal. A new Iowa poll this week reinforced that, finding 91 percent of Iowa Democrats want a candidate who supports the Green New Deal.

“If anything the Green New Deal has brought energy to an issue that had gone stale,” Mr. Whitehouse said, “and as long as we can stay united and keep making progress, it will work out really well for us.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Walk through the doors of the Morgan Library &amp; Museum in New York City these days and it’s possible to travel back more than 100 years.

Visitors can walk up to the original front doors no longer easily visible from outside the museum on East 36th Street, view a hidden staircase in its book-lined library that ascends to its upper tiers, and even meet Belle da Costa Greene, who died in 1950, having been the longtime librarian of the museum’s collector, J. Pierpont Morgan, and the museum’s first director, appointed by Morgan’s son in 1924.

From anywhere in the world, you can encounter David Bowie, the rock legend who died in 2016 and was the star of a wildly popular, world-touring exhibition created by the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum in London, and check out over 400 exhibition items and others not on display there.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>It’s fashionable to ridicule Georg Baselitz, one of the richer white male painters around, especially since he opined in an interview in 2013 that female painters could not summon the brutality necessary for greatness or at least market success. But the market is a suspect measure. And while something like brutality definitely figures in ambition and originality, it can’t be limited to male definitions, which is too bad for men and not the problem of women.

[Read about what to see during Asia Week New York, running through March 23.]

It’s tempting to respond to such ignorance by shunning the artist, but that matches know-nothingness with more of the same, and certainty with certainty . I recommend “Devotion,” Mr. Baselitz’s exhibition at Gagosian, for its gnarly ink drawings based mostly on self-portraits by other painters. These portraits of self-portraits combine automatic drawing and caricature with riffs on the styles of their sources, be they Henri Rousseau, Willem de Kooning or Andy Warhol, revealing a talent for mimicry that might be the artist’s strongest. The heads are inverted as usual, blending the artist’s fusion of abstraction and representation with unusual vehemence. They have an eruptive sardonic energy; devotion mixes with a sharply humorous misanthropic edge.

All artists create fictive worlds that help them survive. This includes floating uninformed, attention-grabbing opinions — like, say, Donald Judd’s insistence on painting’s death. The exhibition suggests that Mr. Baselitz may be walking his position on female painters back a little bit, if far from enough. For example, he might have included Frida Kahlo, an unblinking self-portraitist. But he’s added Joan Mitchell, Nicole Eisenman and Tracey Emin to two painters he has previously mentioned: Paula Modersohn-Becker and Cecily Brown. And three of the five living artists in the show are female and also the youngest. That says a great deal about where the future of the medium lies. ROBERTA SMITH</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“The question they ask is, are you going to die?” she said. “You yourself don’t know the answer.” With the new papers, she said, comes a charge to doctors and other health care professionals to help parents frame the answer to that difficult question, and not to delegate it to others. “There’s no easy way but I think it’s really important we do it and important that professionals navigate those really difficult waters, and hold our hand through the journey.”

The guidelines take into account the ways that children’s understanding of death and dying changes as they grow, and give advice for how to shape these conversations. With very young children, Dr. Stein said, discussion early on might emphasize the seriousness of the condition and the importance of treatment, but not necessarily the issue of death, unless they ask.

Children around 5 to 7 often feel very responsible when bad things happen, Dr. Stein said. One 7-year-old boy whose mother died became convinced that it was his fault because she had missed a clinic visit one day when he had a bad tantrum. “He felt he had caused his mother’s death, because she hadn’t gone to the clinic and gotten the information she needed,” Dr. Stein said.

When the children are the patients, they also worry that these conversations will be too painful for their parents, said Dr. Emily Harrop, a consultant in pediatric palliative care at Oxford who is a co-author on the articles. “I have seen in practice children becoming quite anxious and distressed, feeling a protectiveness of their parents, not wanting to open the conversation, perhaps not even feeling they have permission to die.”

She recalled caring for a 4-year-old girl with a brain tumor whose mother believed that her daughter did not know she was going to die. When the mother was out of the room, the child asked the doctor, “How will I get through the ceiling when I go up to heaven?”

In her experience, Dr. Harrop said, “Children who’ve had good information sharing are much calmer, less anxious.” That requires having the conversations well and carefully, and keeping them free of jargon. “I would always start the conversation by having the child say to me what they understand, so I understand how they have received information,” she said.

Dr. Kelly described her own medical team as “exemplary” in how they broke the news to her, but at the moment of diagnosis their focus was entirely on her, while she was more anguished about her children. “It would help tremendously if these conversations start with health care providers,” she said.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>In Scottish criminal courts there are three possible verdicts rather than our two. To “guilty” and “not guilty” is added “not proven.” This has the effect of a not guilty, yet the jury is saying, “There was insufficient evidence, but we believe you committed the offense.” The stigma remains.

Robert Mueller wrote that his investigation “did not establish” that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, rather than Attorney General William Barr’s wording, more favorable to Mr. Trump, that Mr. Mueller “did not find” a conspiracy. It seems to me that Mr. Mueller intended the stigma of that Scottish “not proven” choice.

Mr. Trump may call himself fully exonerated, yet I anticipate that if we get to read the Mueller report itself, we will see a much less favorable verdict.

As someone who firmly believes Donald Trump is unfit to be president, I have simple advice for the Democratic Party: Put the Mueller report behind you and concentrate on the defeat of Mr. Trump in 2020. Mistakes were made in the 2016 campaign, resulting in the election of Mr. Trump. Learn from those mistakes.</TEXT>

      <TITLE>Miró’s Greatness? It Was There From the Start - The New York Times</TITLE>

      <TEXT>There are also two portraits that hark back to Miró’s great early efforts in the genre. One is the majestic “Self-Portrait I” of 1937-38, in which the artist’s visage emerges from a panoply of pale grays and pastel-tinted whites and a veritable universe of vegetal husks and spores. Finally there is his “Portrait of a Man in a Late Nineteenth-Century Frame.” This is a found portrait (and a nicely pretentious one) that Miró ingeniously altered, sanding it down here and there and adding the signs and symbols of his antic universe. This hilarious violation dates from 1950, a few years before the Danish artist Asger Jorn began reworking thrift-store paintings. (Coincidentally Jorn’s influence is traced in “Strategic Vandalism: The Legacy of Asger Jorn’s Modification Paintings” at the Petzel Gallery in Chelsea.)

This exhibition has been organized by Anne Umland, senior curator in the museum’s painting and sculpture department, who was also responsible for its 2008 show “Joan Miró: Painting and Anti-Painting, 1927-1937.” There’s a caveat: limiting this effort to MoMA’s admittedly glorious Mirós distorts the singularity of “The Birth of the World” and underserves Miró’s career as a whole.

From 1923 to 1927, Miró made scores of paintings with thin, brushed surfaces of one or two colors embellished with symbols, letters and words. Though not as extreme in their use of chance as “The Birth of the World,” at least one or two examples should have been borrowed. In addition, after visiting New York in 1947 and encountering the work of the Abstract Expressionists, Miró pursued the implications of his 1925 masterpiece into new areas. The exhibition might have included a glimpse of late Miró, which MoMA has collected very little and which is due a reconsideration. It’s great to see all the early gems, but the full story of “The Birth of the World” awaits a truer telling, perhaps at a different institution.

Through June 15 at the Museum of Modern Art, Manhattan; 212-708-9400, moma.org.</TEXT>

Hungary: The country has effectively granted a Russian bank diplomatic immunity from any scrutiny by the police or financial regulators. Western security officials are concerned that Russian spies could use it as a base for intelligence operations.

Spain: A bar in Madrid celebrating the dictator Gen. Francisco Franco and catering to the radical right is run by a Chinese man — an irony that has not gone unnoticed by patrons. “We used to joke to him,” one said. “If Franco was still alive, he would kill you.”

Apple: The tech giant’s next big product isn’t a new device, but a billion-dollar-plus foray into streaming video. The company is expected to reveal details of the project next week.

      <TEXT>Overlooked is a series of obituaries about remarkable people whose deaths, beginning in 1851, went unreported in The Times.

Bessie Blount was about 7 when a teacher rapped her knuckles during a classroom assignment. The blow stung her, the reason even more so.

“For writing with my left hand!” Blount told The Virginian-Pilot newspaper in 2008, still incredulous more than 85 years later.

So she taught herself to write with her teeth and her toes, figuring, “If it was wrong to write with my left hand, then it was wrong to write with my right hand.”

That act of defiance — along with her inventiveness — would serve her throughout an eclectic international career, as a nurse, physical therapist, wartime inventor and forensic handwriting and document analyst. With each of these moves she had to overcome the obstacles facing a black woman in the job, although she resisted being defined by her race.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>R. Kelly’s line, in the midst of his 80-minute interview with CBS’s Gayle King about his charges of sexual abuse, was the opening lyric of one of the most bizarre and unhinged performances of the R&amp;B singer’s career.

He shrieked into the camera: “You’re killing me, man!” He smacked his fist into his palm. He beat his chest. He paced and stabbed the air and seemed as if he might lose physical control. (Ms. King later said that she didn’t worry that the singer would harm her, but she thought that “I might get accidentally clobbered.”)

He kept on rambling even as his handlers tried to soothe him and reapplied his makeup, as if administering to a boxer between rounds.

The obvious question, after Mr. Kelly’s Tuesday meltdown replayed for days, finally becoming a CBS prime time special Friday night, was: Why would he agree to this? How could he imagine this might possibly help him?</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Last weekend, the Metropolitan Riveters nearly re-enacted “Planes, Trains and Automobiles” trying to reach their semifinal game of the National Women’s Hockey League playoffs.

The Riveters dealt with predawn alarms; being momentarily stranded in Charlotte, N.C.; and losing most of their equipment. The game, against the Minnesota Whitecaps in St. Paul, scheduled for last Sunday, was postponed. The semifinal will now be played Friday night in St. Paul, with the Isobel Cup final scheduled for two days later at the same rink.

The N.W.H.L., in its fourth season, has had travel-and weather-related postponements before, as have other professional leagues like the W.N.B.A. Despite partnerships with four N.H.L. franchises, N.W.H.L. teams still travel with budgetary and time constraints.

Some Riveters players who expected to play last Sunday will not be available for the rescheduled game because they cannot take the day off from their full-time jobs.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Mel Miller, who rose to the highest ranks of New York State government as speaker of the State Assembly and publicly feuded with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, but who was forced from office because of a fraud conviction that was later overturned, died on Friday in Manhattan. He was 79.

His wife, Elizabeth Miller, said the cause was complications of lung cancer.

Mr. Miller was found guilty in 1991 of defrauding clients of his private law practice in the 1980s, when he was an Assembly member from Brooklyn but before becoming speaker of the Democratic-controlled body.

An appeals court threw out the conviction in 1993, saying his actions had not constituted felonies. But Mr. Miller, who had been in the Assembly for 21 years and speaker for five, said he would not resume his political career.

“I don’t think elective office is for me,” he said. “Maybe it’s a little ego. You were king in your own domain; it’s hard to come back into the system as something else.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Chisa Hutchinson’s “Surely Goodness and Mercy,” at Theater Row, takes its title from Psalms, the section of the Bible that — if we’re to believe the show’s curmudgeonly but kindhearted lunch lady, Bernadette — is where all the good book’s bangers are. And though this morality play has its collection basket full of tokens of charity, it still feels withholding.

Under Jessi D. Hill’s direction, the 95-minute Keen Company production moves quickly, in a series of gasp-like three- or four-minute scenes. But the plot is fairly bare-bones: Tino (Jay Mazyck), an intelligent 12-year-old boy who lives with his abusive aunt, Alneesa (Sarita Covington), in Newark, befriends Bernadette (Brenda Pressley) and a brassy classmate while doing some extracurricular Bible reading. When Tino resolves to help Bernadette with an illness, she ultimately returns the favor.

Perhaps that’s giving too much away, but the play’s spare, homiletic approach is upfront from the beginning. What you see is what you get, with church sermons about giving blessings and being granted blessings in return.</TEXT>

That’s the running time of “Das Rheingold,” the prelude peopled with gods, dwarves and giants fighting over the gold that will cast its curse over the story. Then, at the beginning of “Die Walküre,” which returned to the Metropolitan Opera on Monday night and will be screened in cinemas worldwide on Saturday, we see a gesture that feels personal and true.

A stranger seeking refuge asks the lady of the house for a drink of water. As she gives it to him, their hands touch. He drinks, and the music surges: Something other than thirst needs quenching.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>KANDAHAR, Afghanistan — The Afghan military has suffered its worst loss of the year in southern Afghanistan, with at least 40 security force members killed in a Taliban attack this past week, but senior officials had still not released a death toll two days later, according to residents and functionaries from the area who spoke on Sunday.

The national authorities and those at the provincial level in Helmand confirmed that an attack occurred in Sangin District, one of the most heavily contested areas in the country, on Friday night, but they either refused to give any details or claimed not to have any as of Sunday.

It was yet another indication that the Taliban were continuing to attack Afghan government forces aggressively even as they have entered peace negotiations on an American withdrawal from the country, with another round of talks expected in Qatar this month.

Some estimates put the number of security forces killed in Sangin late Friday and early Saturday at 65, including 48 Afghan National Army soldiers, 10 pro-government militia fighters and seven police officers, with 43 others wounded, according to Mohammed Hashim Alokozai, an Afghan senator and member of the Defense Committee in Parliament, who is from Sangin.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The Sanders Institute, a public policy group started by the wife and son of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, said on Thursday that it would suspend operations amid Mr. Sanders’s presidential campaign.

“When Bernie decided to run again, and announced it on Feb. 19, we thought it was better in today’s politics to definitely stop taking donations,” said Jane O’Meara Sanders, the senator’s wife and political adviser, in an interview. “We stopped taking donations right away, so that nobody could think they had access or could gain favor to Bernie by giving to the Sanders Institute.”

She said the board had acted in late February at the urging of their son, David Driscoll, the institute’s executive director. The news was first reported by The Associated Press.

The institute, begun in 2017, was envisioned as a wellspring of progressive policy that would build on Mr. Sanders’s agenda. The couple drew criticism over the involvement of Mr. Driscoll, who had previously served as an executive at Burton Snowboards and Nike. Last year, Mr. Driscoll was paid about $100,000, and the institute raised $730,000, Ms. Sanders said.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WASHINGTON — The United States and South Korea will suspend two large-scale joint military exercises this spring, two American officials said Friday, as part of President Trump’s efforts to maintain the truce he has struck with Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea.

A limited version of the training drills, however, are still expected to go forward, officials said. The United States and South Korea have long held large-scale exercises in the spring, known as Key Resolve and Foal Eagle — the latter of which usually includes thousands of ground, naval, air and special operations troops from both nations.

The decision to scale back the military exercises follows nuclear talks this week between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim that ended without an agreement on how — or whether — to shut down North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. As the Trump administration continues to seek a resolution, a Defense Department official said, the high-profile missile exercises that Pyongyang views as provocative will be toned down.

The official said the decision to formally suspend the large-scale drills was expected to be announced by the United States and South Korea in the next few days. It was first reported by NBC News.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>It’s acknowledged for its collection of nearly 7,000 objects in its Native American holdings, including archaeological materials, 19th-century beadwork and hundreds of contemporary items. A 2,400-object Melanesian collection features works from every major island in the region extending from the island of New Guinea in the southwestern Pacific Ocean to the Arafura Sea, and eastward to Fiji. It also features the Owen and Wagner Collection of Indigenous Australian Art.

The Zimmerli Museum’s Russian and Soviet nonconformist art holdings contain over 22,000 objects by more than 1,000 artists and provide an overview from the 14th century to the present. The media include carved stone icons, paintings on canvas and panel, sculpture, works on paper, photography, video, artists’ books, and other self-published underground texts, or samizdat.

There’s a notable collection of 19th-century lubki, simple folk prints of Russia. In addition to art made in Russia, the collection includes examples of nonconformist art produced in the Soviet republics from Armenia to Uzbekistan. It also features ancient to contemporary art including French art of the 19th century.

The current major show, “Becoming John Marin: Modernist at Work,” features works by one of the major figures of American modernism. There are also new portraits of a son of a former slave — Paul Robeson, a singer, actor and activist — by current artists, to celebrate the coming centennial of his graduation from Rutgers.

A collection of nearly 900 works by the figurative painter Alex Katz is a highlight at the college’s museum of art. It recently acquired three etchings by Rembrandt made in the mid-1600s, bringing its collection of prints by the Dutch master to a dozen. The print collection includes works by Picasso, Albrecht Dürer, Goya and James McNeill Whistler.

The museum, which was founded in 1959, comprises five wings, nearly 8,000 works, and more than 36,000 square feet of exhibition space. A current exhibition, “Theaster Gates: Facsimile Cabinet of Women Origin Stories,” includes nearly 3,000 images from the Johnson Publishing Company archive. Founded in 1942, Johnson Publishing recorded the lives of black Americans for more than 70 years through the magazines Ebony and Jet.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>You can get a “Last Blockbuster” sticker at the Bend store for $2. Cups go for $10. Beanies, knit by Sandi Harding , the store’s general manager, cost $15 .

Ms. Harding said she opened accounts for dozens of new customers each week. The commotion over the store, she said, had turned operating it into a “fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants situation.”

Many employees are in their first jobs. Their names and heights are marked on the door of a back office. Pictures of their families clutter Ms. Harding’s desk.

Kaitlyn Willhoite, 25, worked at the chain for six years, starting right after high school, when most of her peers were already eyeball deep in Netflix and YouTube.

“It became a joke with my friends that I worked at Blockbuster,” she said.

Her boyfriend proposed to her one night 10 minutes after she closed the store. Later, when she was pregnant, she thought more than once that her son, Liam, would be born there. Now, she brings him in for movies like “Spiderman: Into the Spider-Verse.”

He likes the theme song, she said.

Randy Honaker, a sound engineer who has worked with directors like Robert Altman and Francis Ford Coppola, is a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Each year, during awards season, he gets dozens of free DVDs to screen.

But when he wants something that his sons, 10 and 13, will enjoy — like “Austin Powers in Goldmember” and “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off ” — he heads for Blockbuster.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Ten years ago, when the global financial crisis seemed at its worst, the stock market hit rock bottom.

The bull run that has followed now ranks among the greatest rallies of the past century: The S&amp;P 500 has more than quadrupled, adding $17.5 trillion in value, and, of the 11 bull markets since the end of World War II, only the run that ended with the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2000 tops the current one in duration and returns.

But despite the superlatives, this rally’s primary characteristic is how much skepticism it generated. The intensity of gains that defined the stock market bubbles of the 1920s and 1990s never developed. Instead, many investors spent the past decade deriding the rally and anticipating its demise.

Bull markets are usually driven by a strengthening economy that fuels corporate profits. But the economic scars of the downturn a decade ago were deep and the recovery slow.</TEXT>

What’s next: It’s unlikely that either the House or the Senate has enough votes to override a veto . But the actions in both chambers could bolster lawsuits contesting the emergency declaration.

Yesterday: In a nonbinding resolution, the House voted 420-0 to demand that the Justice Department publicly release the full findings of the special counsel’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election.

The captain of the Boeing 737 Max 8 that crashed on Sunday faced an emergency almost immediately after takeoff, requesting in a panicky voice to return after three minutes as the aircraft accelerated to abnormal speed.

The account of air traffic communications involving the pilot, Yared Getachew, who had 8,000 hours of flying experience, provides far more detail about what was happening in the cockpit.

How we know: A person who reviewed the communications shared the information with The Times, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the messages have not been publicly released.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea acknowledged for the first time on Friday that the summit meeting last week between its leader, Kim Jong-un, and President Trump ended without an agreement, claiming that people “in and outside” the North were blaming the United States for the breakdown.

Until now, North Korea’s state news media had not reported the collapse of the summit meeting, held in Hanoi, Vietnam, on Feb. 27 and 28. The failed summit was considered a big embarrassment for Mr. Kim because he had to return home empty-handed after Mr. Trump rejected his demand for relief from United Nations sanctions.

“People in and outside the North had hoped that the second North Korea-United States summit meeting, held in Hanoi, would yield good results,” the Rodong Sinmun, the newspaper published by the North’s ruling Workers’ Party, said in a commentary on Friday. “After it unexpectedly ended without an agreement, they are letting out sighs of regret, all arguing that the United States was responsible.”

But the commentary also said that “the whole world sincerely hopes that the peace process on the Korean Peninsula will proceed smoothly and the North Korea-United States relations will improve soon.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Over at Wirecutter, the product review website owned by The New York Times, senior editor Grant Clauser prefers Philips Hue, not just because it’s easy, but because it’s flexible and reliable.

“Among smart bulbs, I prefer Philips Hue because it has a wide ecosystem of products, including basic white bulbs, color changeable bulbs, wireless dimmers, strip lights and outdoor LED lights,” he explained. “Hue lights require a Zigbee gateway, which creates a mesh network in your house that’s more reliable than some of the other smart bulb systems we’ve used. If you don’t want to use the Hue gateway, an Amazon Echo Plus can serve the same purpose, and it also plays music and tells bad jokes.”

Philips Hue requires a smart hub with a relatively simple installation. Plug the box into the wall, press a single button when the app tells you to and you’re good to go. LIFX lights require no hub at all, though they’re a bit more expensive and only as reliable as your Wi-Fi network. For both, most of the setup process takes place in an app on your smartphone. Since you don’t have to modify your home to use them, even renters can get in on the fun.

But the hardest part of getting started with smart lights is altering your light switch habits. For bulb-based lights like the LIFX, you need to leave your light switches on, which takes time to get used to. Fortunately, Philips Hue offers a solution for this. The Smart Dimming Kit lets you stick a switch to your wall to directly control your smart lights. The “switch” is actually a remote, stuck to the wall by magnets, so you can pull it off and use it from the couch if you prefer.

Controlling lights with your voice (or an app) just makes sense

With traditional light switches, you can only turn your lights on and off from one, maybe two spots in a room, and only if you have a free hand. It’s an inconvenience we’ve learned to live with, but there’s an even better way that goes beyond controlling smart lights through your phone. When paired with a voice-controlled smart speaker, the smart lights reach another level.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>It would be hard for me to explain why I so badly wanted to see an eagle on the nest, badly enough that my husband and I have been planning this trip since last summer. I am not particularly inclined to anthropomorphize nature, and I have no sense at all that an eagle on the wing is any more majestic than other large, soaring birds. They are not more beautiful than pelicans flying in formation, or great blue herons gliding over the lake, or vultures riding an air current high in the sky. And I am fully aware that watching a bald eagle pull a fish from the water is not fundamentally different from watching a bluebird pluck a beetle from the grass.

And yet there is something different about this bird, something that made the Second Continental Congress adopt it as the new nation’s emblem — over the objection of Benjamin Franklin. “He is a Bird of bad moral Character,” Franklin wrote in a letter to his daughter. “He does not get his Living honestly. You may have seen him perched on some dead Tree near the River, where, too lazy to fish for himself, he watches the Labour of the Fishing Hawk; and when that diligent Bird has at length taken a Fish, and is bearing it to his Nest for the Support of his Mate and young Ones, the Bald Eagle pursues him and takes it from him.”

Mr. Franklin was not wrong about the bald eagle’s opportunistic nature, but the rest of us love them anyway. At this very minute, all across the web, hundreds of thousands of people are watching wildlife cameras trained on eagles’ nests. Since 2007, a pair of bald eagles in Decorah, Iowa, has reliably produced three eggs a year and raised their eaglets under the watchful eyes of anyone with a modem — more than 370 million viewers so far. When tragedy struck last year — the male disappeared without a trace, leaving the female to raise their chicks alone — the Raptor Resource Project, which maintains the camera, held a Facebook memorial service for the beloved bird. (The female has taken a new mate this year and is laying eggs again.)</TEXT>

      <TITLE>Should the U.S. Ban Military-Style Semiautomatic Weapons? - The New York Times</TITLE>

      <TEXT>Should the United States follow New Zealand’s example and ban all military-style semiautomatic weapons in an attempt to prevent future mass shootings? Or would such a ban be unconstitutional or impractical here?

In “New Zealand to Ban Military-Style Semiautomatic Guns, Jacinda Ardern Says,” Damien Cave and Charlotte Graham-McLay write:

CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand — Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand on Thursday announced a national ban on all military-style semiautomatic weapons, all high-capacity ammunition magazines and all parts that allow weapons to be modified into the kinds of guns used to kill 50 people at two mosques in Christchurch last week. “What we’re banning today are the things used in last Friday’s attack,” she said, adding: “It’s about all of us, it’s in the national interest and it’s about safety.” Ms. Ardern is expected to encounter little resistance to the weapons ban in Parliament; the largest opposition party quickly said it supported the measures. Ms. Ardern said her goal was to eliminate from New Zealand the weapons that the killer used in Christchurch. She emphasized that it would require a buyback of banned weapons in circulation now, plus regulation around firearms and ammunition. “The guns used in these terrorist attacks had important distinguishing features,” she said at a news conference at Parliament in Wellington, the capital. “First, big capacity, and also their delivery. They had the power to shoot continuously, but they also had large capacity magazines.” Ms. Ardern’s plan for immediate gun policy changes, announced six days after a mass shooting, stands in stark contrast to the stalemate and resistance to change that has stymied similar calls for restrictions on firearms in the United States. Many Americans can buy a gun in less than an hour. In New Zealand, the process can take weeks or months. Ms. Ardern’s handling of the massacre and its aftermath have resonated around the world and thrust her into the spotlight as a force on the issue of guns. The shooting in New Zealand comes after the United States has experienced an alarming number of mass shootings in recent years, including the Sandy Hook, Conn., school shooting that took 27 lives in 2012; the Orlando nightclub shooting in 2016, which killed 49; the Las Vegas concert shooting in 2017 that left 58 dead; and the Parkland, Fla., school shooting, which killed 17 people in 2018.

Ms. Ardern’s overhauls have been inspired in part by neighboring Australia’s response after a mass shooting in 1996. The article continues:

Mr. Alpers said the challenge for New Zealand would mainly be getting the ammunition and guns that already exist out of circulation. Half of Australia’s states had some kind of gun registration plan in place before the 1996 reforms, making it easier for the authorities to know what weapons were out there and what needed to be brought in. New Zealand only registers 4 percent of its weapons. According to the police, about 250,000 people in the country own an estimated 1.2 million to 1.5 million firearms. It is unclear how many of them would be affected by the ban. “New Zealand is at a considerable disadvantage to countries that have had registries, because there’s no way of tracing the firearms because they don’t know who’s got them,” Mr. Alpers said. “We’re relying entirely on the honesty of the gun owner to turn it in.” Ms. Ardern said that fair compensation would be paid to all those who participate.

Students, read the entire article, then tell us:

— What is your reaction to Prime Minister Ardern’s decision to ban semiautomatic weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines? Should the United States do the same? If not, how should our country address the issue of guns and mass shootings?

When a terrorist massacred 50 people at two New Zealand mosques last week, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern immediately grasped the nettle. “I can tell you one thing right now,” she told a news conference. “Our gun laws will change.” That’s what effective leadership looks like. New Zealand’s cabinet has now agreed in principle to overhaul those laws, experts are reviewing ways to make the country safer from firearms and, Ardern promised, “within 10 days of this horrific act of terrorism, we will have announced reforms.” Contrast that with the United States, where just since 1970, more Americans have died from guns (1.45 million, including murders, suicides and accidents) than died in all the wars in American history (1.4 million). More Americans die from guns every 10 weeks than died in the entire Afghanistan and Iraq wars combined, yet we still don’t have gun safety rules as rigorous as New Zealand’s even before the mosques were attacked.

Do you agree with Mr. Kristof? Has America lacked leadership on the issue of gun violence? How would you assess the quality of leadership by elected officials in the United States?

— New Zealand has a population of 4.6 million and an estimated 1.2 million to 1.5 million firearms. The United States has a population of 327 million people and over 300 million guns. In what ways do you think New Zealand’s weapons ban is relevant to the situation in the United States? Do you think the ban represents a realistic model of legislation that could happen here? Or are there too many obstacles or logistical issues that would make such a ban more difficult to enact?

— Additionally, the United States has an explicit amendment protecting gun rights that New Zealand does not. The Second Amendment to the Constitution reads:

However, the Library of Congress writes, “The meaning of this sentence is not self-evident, and has given rise to much commentary but relatively few Supreme Court decisions.” What do you think these words mean? What relevance should they have for the debate about guns? Do you think a ban on military-style semiautomatic weapons would be constitutional?

— In her announcement on Thursday, Ms. Ardern said, “It’s about all of us, it’s in the national interest and it’s about safety.” Do you think it is possible for the government to find a healthy balance between protecting people’s right to own a gun and public safety? Do you believe the government is currently striking the right balance? Why or why not?

      <TEXT>LONDON — A measure of the strangeness of the times in Brexit Britain is that one can buy T-shirts bearing the face of John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, in the stylized stencil preferred by street artists and skateboarders, with the word ORDER.

“He is spitting the best sassy statements in that charming accent,” said Kaarlo Junkkari, a 19-year-old Finnish man who sells the T-shirts online. He said he had become fascinated with Mr. Bercow, whose prolix verbal style and braying cries of “order, order!” have made him one of Brexit’s “spicy memes.”

But this enthusiasm is not universal in Britain, especially on Tuesday, after Mr. Bercow startled the country by blocking Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan to push her withdrawal agreement through Parliament before a trip on Thursday to Brussels. He announced that he would not allow a third vote on her plan for Brexit, as the departure from the European Union is known, unless the plan differed from the one rejected last week.

This ruling — based on an obscure precedent from 1604 — has made Mr. Bercow, a wonky arbiter of parliamentary procedure, one of the most admired and hated men in the country.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Re “U.S. Said to Have Recordings of Alleged Sept. 11 Mastermind Talking About Plot” (news article, March 26):

Are the prosecutors actually saying there exist tapes of calls made in April to October of 2001 , but divulged to defense lawyers only in 2016 , that reveal the attack planning that have been kept secret from us until now? And that the calls’ origins, methods of collecting them and chain of custody can’t be examined?

One would have thought that the 9/11 Commission might have unearthed any 9/11 planning calls back in 2003 or 2004, when we family members were publicly pleading for this type of evidence. Why did it take until 2016 to mention the existence of these tapes? What was the National Security Agency doing with the tapes all this time?

In what kind of code were the planners speaking? Will we ever get to hear the tapes or read the transcripts? We are in the 34th round of pretrial hearings and still no actual date has been set for the trial. Which parts of the Constitution apply?

Maybe someone else besides us will finally take notice of these outrageous kangaroo court proceedings happening at Guantánamo.</TEXT>

      <TITLE>Norway Moves to Sell Some Oil and Gas Shares From Wealth Fund - The New York Times</TITLE>

      <TEXT>Some analysts said the Norwegian government’s move signaled fears about the future of the oil business, as concerns grow about the industry’s role in climate change.

“Obviously, oil and gas will be around for some time, but being too dependent on oil and gas is risky, whether it be for a nation or an oil company,” said Bard V. Solhjell, chief executive of the WWF-Norway, an environmental group.

While Norway has a strong environmental movement, its economy is heavily dependent on the oil and gas industry, which contributed about 21 percent of government revenues last year.

Explaining why it was not excluding giant oil companies from the fund, the Finance Ministry said it anticipated that almost all the growth in renewable energy over the next decade would come from diversified companies that did not focus exclusively on renewables.

Analysts said the ministry was probably referring to oil giants like BP and Royal Dutch Shell, which are among the top 20 equity holdings of the fund. (At the end of last year, oil and gas stocks made up about 6 percent of the fund’s stock portfolio.) These companies are making investments in renewables that, while sizable, are modest compared with the amounts of cash they continue to pump into oil and gas.

“The reason they are keeping them is because they think they might increase their renewables, which are of course a direct competitor to oil and gas,” said Andrew Grant, a senior analyst at Carbon Tracker, a research organization that warns investors about potential climate risks.

Mr. Grant and others said the Norwegian government, perhaps as a political compromise, was dumping the oil companies in the fund that had the greatest perceived risk because they were focused on fossil fuels, while encouraging those that remained to invest more in renewables.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Consider Quentin Tarantino, who learned movie history as a video store clerk himself in the 1980s. Once video stores were the only place cinephiles could find favorite films after they left theaters. Then came the internet. The rise of online streaming services was a convenience for movie lovers, but it spelled, too, the end of an era. Last month, Blockbuster, which used to operate 9,000 stores, announced that only one remained, in Bend, Ore.

As for Scarecrow, it survived bankruptcy, the threat of closing and the death of its charismatic founder. In 2014, it became a nonprofit. And now, after 30 years, with more than 132,000 titles — many on VHS, laser disc and DVD — it is as much a cultural warehouse as anything else.

And that gives Kate Barr, Scarecrow’s president, pause. Film lovers today have access to a prescribed number of movies on streaming services like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu, and other niche channels. Old treasures — many of which are unavailable online because of rights issues or technological hurdles — are being locked away, forgotten or even destroyed .

Of Scarecrow, Ms. Barr said, “We will fight to the death to keep this open.”

Sure, most people no longer want to trudge to the video store on a Friday night, as they once did in droves. Streaming movies are available through on-demand cable, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and many other sources. But the emphasis tends to be on current titles, or TV series. Netflix, which pioneered renting DVDs by mail and streaming, has been moving steadily into original programming, for example.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>After earning enough to purchase his freedom (ransoming the life that should have always been his own), Hayden organized a fund-raiser to pay a $650 fine securing the release from jail of the white abolitionist who had aided his escape (a Methodist minister from the Midwest, Calvin Fairbank). Hayden chose the activist life, fighting for the dignity of others as part of what the historian Manisha Sinha called the “shock troops” of “fugitive slave rescues,” in her book “The Slave’s Cause.” The home that the Haydens made, the one I would soon be visiting, became a refuge for the hunted.

On the day of my visit, the homeowners, Mary and John Gier, ushered me in with warm smiles and graciously served tea and cookies. The couple, who are proud of their heritage (English, Dutch, Irish and German) but resist hyphenated labels like “Euro-American” or “African-American,” told me they bought the house in the 1970s. They cherish their historic home and have preserved or replicated most of the original features: cabinetry, doors, windows, flooring, fireplaces, and exterior brown brick. Even the 19th-century tunnel is visible in the subbasement. Lovingly restored and furnished with period antiques, the house looks much the same as it might have during Hayden’s residence. “Harriet Beecher Stowe probably sat there having tea just like you are,” they noted. “This is the same room where Hayden met with his band of resisters.”

Mrs. Gier confirmed that the sticker was a relatively recent addition to the facade, but it was clear she and her husband saw the N.R.A. emblem as simpatico with the home’s spirit. To them, Lewis Hayden is a “model for America.” Mrs. Gier thinks if he were alive today, he would be a member of the N.R.A. or the National African-American Gun Association. “Can you imagine what would have happened had he not had his guns?” she said. “I believe that Hayden would have left no stone unturned to maintain his defense. In that sense, he is not unlike our law-abiding citizens today who are protecting their constitutional rights.”

I am anti-gun and support strict gun control laws. But sipping tea with the homeowners, walking the floors where the Haydens and their compatriots had plotted what turned out to be the roots of a political revolution to overturn slavery, pried ajar a little door in my mind.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The disparity between what designers tout as their sources of inspiration and what turns up on the runway can be either comical or grim.

Take the case of Virgil Abloh’s sophomore collection as the creative director of men’s wear for Louis Vuitton. Interviewed at his studio before his January show in Paris, Mr. Abloh spoke of his childhood idol Michael Jackson as something far more than a great entertainer. He was, he said, “the most important innovator in men’s wear history.”

Though that point is debatable, it was one Mr. Abloh underscored by sending out white rhinestone gloves as show invitations and transforming a tent in the Jardins des Tuileries into a likeness of the sidewalk set from Jackson’s “Billie Jean&quot; video.

That the show itself had scant literal connection to the entertainer was, in the end, fortunate for Mr. Abloh considering the attention trained on Jackson’s alleged history of sexually abusing children, in the documentary “Leaving Neverland.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Ranking Roger, a vocalist for the popular British ska band the Beat in the late 1970s and early ’80s who carried on that group’s infectious sound in subsequent bands and solo projects, died on Tuesday in Birmingham, England. He was 56.

An announcement on his current group’s website said he had received a cancer diagnosis last year.

Ranking Roger, whose real name was Roger Charlery, was one of two frontmen for the Beat, along with Dave Wakeling. The group, which was known as the English Beat in the United States to avoid confusion with a California power-pop band of the same name, had a brief but influential run after its founding in 1978, expanding on the ska sound, a lively precursor to reggae that had first migrated to England from Jamaica in the 1960s.

“Ska is their base,” The Boston Globe wrote of the Beat in 1981, “but it’s infused with satisfying pressure-cooker-like tension and cut with reggae, pop and soul elements.” Neil Strauss, looking back on the group’s heyday in a 1995 article in The New York Times, described the Beat’s sound as “Jamaican ska informed by punk rock.”

Mr. Charlery, who was black, and Mr. Wakeling, who is white, complemented each other: Mr. Wakeling was a more traditional vocalist, while Mr. Charlery “toasted,” the Jamaican version of rapping.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Try not to smile when you watch Yo-Yo Ma and Wu Man onstage together. I dare you.

The two musicians — he’s a superstar cellist, she’s our leading pipa player — seem at first like an odd couple. Mr. Ma plays with brazen emotionality; you get the impression he couldn’t pull off a poker face if he tried. Ms. Wu, calm and unshowy, casts a quiet spell as she gracefully plucks the strings of her lutelike instrument.

But they exude amiability, with jolly glances frequently thrown back and forth, and unexpected compatibility. The cello and pipa have vastly different sounds and histories. Yet together, in the hands of Mr. Ma and Ms. Wu, they are as intimately harmonious as a cafe singer and guitarist.

At David Geffen Hall through Saturday, they’re playing Zhao Lin’s double concerto “A Happy Excursion,” which had its American premiere on Wednesday with the New York Philharmonic under the direction of Long Yu. (And how refreshing to hear a work by a Chinese composer outside the Philharmonic’s annual Lunar New Year concert.)</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Susa was a center for artistic brickmaking. Large, decorative friezes of polychrome glazed bricks, some of them molded into bas-reliefs, line the walls, pieced together like giant puzzles from thousands of fragments. One frieze shows bearded, richly clad archers carrying bows, quivers and spears as they march. Others depict muscular lions, their mouths open wide as they bare their teeth; griffons with lions’ heads, bodies and forelegs, the hind legs of an eagle and the horns of a ram; and winged bulls. The friezes use dazzling glazes of turquoise, green, brown, white and yellow.

One of the most unusual objects in the Louvre collection is a handle of a fourth-century-B.C. vase in the shape of a winged ibex. It was made in silver and gold, so delicately that it seems to be flying. There are also clay accounting tokens (representing quantities of goods) and pottery; carved cylindrical seals; gold jewelry with semiprecious stones; terra cotta figurines; and metal, clay and ivory sculptures. Fragments of black-and-white floor tiles from an unknown composite material show that they had been made to look like marble.

If you leave the Darius palace rooms and retrace your steps, you will come upon another treasure uncovered in Susa: a seven-foot-tall black stone stele in the shape of an index finger, standing alone under spotlights. Carved into it in cuneiform script is the Code of Hammurabi, the Babylonian system of law in ancient Mesopotamia. Dating from about 1750 B.C., the stele was plundered and taken back to Susa in the mid-12th century B.C.

It consists of 282 laws, including ones governing trade, slavery, theft, interest rates, the presumption of innocence and the principle of “eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,” with graded punishments determined by the violator’s social status.

Unlike much of the Louvre, the Near Eastern Antiquities section is gloriously free of crowds. The Code of Hammurabi, however, has been added to the French elementary school curriculum, and on any given day, there may be several classes of students sitting at its base, as museum curators tell its story.

“You ask me why I am interested in Iran, well, it’s because it was the center of the world,” Mr. Cuny said. “The Persian Empire — the center of the world in that era. You enter these rooms, and you have arrived in Persia.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>THIN BLUE LIE

 The Failure of High-Tech Policing

 By Matt Stroud

Over the past two decades, technology has taken over policing. Officers wear body cameras to record their encounters and carry newfangled weapons like tasers that seem to come straight out of “Star Trek.” The police patrol criminal “hot spots” identified by big data. Suspects are tracked with GPS, cell-site simulators and video surveillance enhanced with facial recognition software. Has all this costly technology made us safer?

Not likely, according to “Thin Blue Lie: The Failure of High-Tech Policing,” Matt Stroud’s incisive, muckraking exposé of the “police industrial complex” — the web of law enforcement agencies, for-profit corporations and politicians who increasingly exalt technology as the way to reform American policing. Although innovative tools can help solve crimes, police departments often embrace new technologies without adequate testing or input from affected communities. The result is that “fixes” can aggravate the very problems they were designed to remedy.

Stroud, an investigative journalist with an eye for detail, begins the book with a bang — or rather a zap. Volunteering to be tasered, he describes an extraordinary pain that lasted only five seconds, he writes, “but felt like an eternity.” Felled by the weapon, Stroud’s own experience is a metaphor for the troubling tale of how tasers became standard equipment for cops. Developed originally as a nonlethal alternative to the gun, tasers were relentlessly marketed to police departments by Taser International, a hungry start-up that stirred demand through celebrity cop endorsements and dramatic demonstrations of burly volunteers being dropped. Company trainers touted the tasers as safe, encouraging officers to use them early and often to prevent bad situations from escalating. Major police departments bought in and Taser International became a Wall Street darling.

Then the bodies began to mount. Tasers did not lead to a decline in gun use, as marketed; they became instead a new tool for police abuse, employed against nonthreatening people for failure to follow officers’ commands. And some taser victims did die — deaths for which Taser International publicly denied responsibility, citing autopsy reports that, according to Stroud, did not support the company’s claims. Indeed, Stroud insists the company never even rigorously tested the safety of tasers. According to Stroud, Taser International’s executives, in an effort to keep sales and stock prices high, cut corners, misled the public and the police and in the process made millions. Meanwhile, taxpayers, who foot the bill for police misconduct, have paid out more than $172 million in taser-related lawsuits.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Mr. Biden’s first instinct will most likely be to explain and justify. That used to work in politics, a lot of the time. It doesn’t anymore, in the age of social media. Today, self-justification is among the greatest offenses a public figure can commit.

Twitter is toxic and awful, and it’s always useful to remember that Twitter is not America. That said, the medium does efficiently reduce matters to their essence. And if Mr. Biden tried to defend his actions around the Thomas hearings — or to use his vice presidency under Barack Obama as cover — he would be savaged on social media, and that would metastasize into the conventional wisdom on him.

So regarding Anita Hill, he needs to say he was wrong. And, crucially, he has to make clear exactly what he has learned in the intervening 28 years. That’s the hard part, but it’s what may convince his skeptics that he is a different person now. The same is true of his past position on school desegregation.

On crime, he’s probably free to do a bit more contextualizing, explaining how big a problem crime was then. But if that’s the main thing people hear, it will again sound too self-justifying. Far better to say, “That was then, this is now,” tick off a list of initiatives aimed at improving the prospects of young black men and point out all the things he has done over the years along those lines (in a 40-plus-year career, they must exist).

Finally, with respect to his centrism, Mr. Biden needs to pull off the trick, which dexterous politicians can do, of showing that he has nudged himself a bit to the left without sounding inauthentic. He might nod here toward young people, acknowledging that if he’d grown up with the capitalism that they did, he’d be mad, too.

If Mr. Biden can acknowledge this and convince the doubters that he’s learned from the past, the Biden Paradox could be overcome. But of course, he has to actually believe he was once wrong on these questions, and this we do not know.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>My baby teeth never fell out. Instead, I yanked them out, roots and all, as soon as they were loose.

I could have saved myself considerable pain by letting nature take its course. But I’m a serial “precrastinator”: I flip pancakes before bubbles have formed on the surface; I get to the grocery store before it opens; I turn in work before it’s due. The urge to complete a task is so strong I forge ahead even when I know waiting would lead to a better outcome.

Yes, this might sound a little nonsensical. But it’s not uncommon.

David Rosenbaum, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Riverside, published a study in 2014 in which he coined the term “precrastination,” which he defines as the tendency to tackle subgoals at the earliest opportunity — even at the expense of extra effort.

“It’s like going to the grocery store, loading up your basket with a bunch of apples, then schlepping them with you as you shop even though you know you’ll pass them again on the way to the checkout counter,” Dr. Rosenbaum said.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WELLINGTON, New Zealand — As the release of a new documentary detailing abuse accusations against the singer Michael Jackson has prompted debate about his legacy, the public response to its contents is also leading radio stations across the globe to stop playing his music.

A radio network in Quebec pulled Jackson’s music from its nearly two dozen stations, according to The Canadian Press. In Britain, Variety reported that the BBC was forced to deny imposing such a ban after it was reported that the singer’s music had been “quietly dropped” from one of its stations.

And the backlash has led to an almost complete removal of the singer’s music from the airwaves in New Zealand, after the two largest radio networks — which own most of the country’s commercial stations — said Wednesday that they would no longer play Jackson’s songs.

In the New Zealand and Canadian cases, radio networks cited a change in public opinion about Jackson that was tied to the documentary “Leaving Neverland,” a two-part mini-series focusing on the accusations of two men who say Jackson abused them as children, as the reason for the ban. The program is scheduled for broadcast in New Zealand on Sunday and Monday.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>In a sign of the growing backlash against “cashless” stores around the country, the City of Philadelphia will require retailers to accept legal tender starting this summer.

Retail outlets that have stopped accepting cash say it is faster and easier for their employees to process digital payments. But critics say the practice discriminates against people without bank accounts or credit cards, or who simply prefer to pay cash.

City Councilman Bill Greenlee, a co-sponsor of the bill, said it would ensure fairness as residents complete everyday transactions.

“It just seemed to me unfair that I could walk into a coffee shop right across from City Hall, and I had a credit card and could get a cup of coffee. And the person behind me, who had United States currency, could not,” he said in a phone interview on Thursday.</TEXT>

Ms. Pittenger was happy to have a celebrity follower. Then came the anxiety.

“Honestly, I had a moment of paralysis,” Ms. Pittenger said. “I thought, ‘Why would he follow me?’ I was basically a nervous wreck that he was following me at all.”

Mr. Cusack, whose three-decade career has included starring roles in “Say Anything,” “High Fidelity” and “Hot Tub Time Machine,” followed Ms. Pittenger after she said, in a tweet, that the two of them shared a fondness for the antiwar activist Daniel Berrigan. Mr. Cusack had used a Berrigan quotation in his Twitter bio, Ms. Pittenger noted, and she had quoted the same line on her Facebook page.</TEXT>

His son Kaedi said he died in a hospital after a heart attack.

Mr. Taylor’s character on “Sanford and Son,” the long-running NBC series that starred Redd Foxx as the irascible junk dealer Fred Sanford, was the friend and sidekick of Fred’s son, Lamont, played by Demond Wilson. The fast-talking but good-hearted Rollo affectionately called Fred “Pops,” but Fred viewed him with skepticism and sometimes hostility because he thought Rollo, who had spent time in jail, was a bad influence on Lamont. Mr. Taylor appeared in 32 episodes between 1972 and 1977.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>They were rescued the next day by a villager with a canoe.

A couple of miles down the inundated path, two women dried corn on the ground next to a one-room church, whose roof had caved in at a sharp angle, and talked about the floodwaters.

“This high,” said one of the women, Maria Juliai, 27, holding her hand against the wall of the broken church. It was about six feet above the ground.

They, too, had sought refuge in a mango tree.

“We were up the tree Saturday and Sunday,” Ms. Juliai said. “And then four men from the village came to rescue us.”

One of those men, Jambo Domindos, 59, said that he and his friends, all strong swimmers, saved more than a dozen people, including 3-month-old twin girls, from trees.

“When we found them, most of them were crying,” he said.

At the Muda Mufo school, mothers and young children were taking shelter in classrooms or playing in the yard’s soft mud. Most of the men were back home, busy farming. Their families would join them when the water receded more.

Mr. Lazaro said he was eager to leave the shelter.

“I’ll see what the weather is like,” he said, “and then I’ll do machamba again.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WASHINGTON — Justice Clarence Thomas was busy in February. As usual, he asked no questions during Supreme Court arguments. But he made up for his silence with three opinions in eight days that took issue with some of the court’s most prominent precedents.

He called on Feb. 19 for the court to reconsider New York Times v. Sullivan, the 1964 decision that provided the press with broad First Amendment protections against libel suits brought by public officials. The Sullivan case — and rulings extending it — Justice Thomas wrote, “were policy-driven decisions masquerading as constitutional law.”

The next day, he criticized Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion, calling it “notoriously incorrect” and the product of misguided efforts to identify and protect fundamental rights under the due process clause of the 14th amendment.

A week later, he expressed skepticism about Gideon v. Wainwright, the 1963 decision that said the Sixth Amendment requires the government to provide lawyers to poor people accused of serious crimes. Justice Thomas wrote that the Sixth Amendment, as understood by those who drafted and ratified it, guaranteed only the right to hire a lawyer.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>In schools, civic education tends to accord outsize importance to the Bill of Rights at the expense of the more complex topics of separation of powers, federalism and other pillars of the constitutional edifice. Hamilton had opposed a Bill of Rights in part because he thought these mechanisms safeguarded rights better than protections inscribed on paper could. Journalists and politicians equally obsess over winners and losers. The public hears whose ox is being gored, but too rarely the importance of the constitutional process by which the goring occurs.

A Madisonian people, by contrast, will care about constitutional integrity in addition to political outcomes. This is for constitutional reasons but also for selfish ones: The power whose use one celebrates today will be wielded by a leader with whom one disagrees tomorrow, a lesson Democrats who endorsed Mr. Obama’s unilateral executive orders are now learning. Such citizens will also understand that they occupy the country along with more than 325 million fellow citizens whose views must be accommodated.

Crucially, they will not tolerate members of Congress who surrender legislative authority, even for results to some voters’ momentary liking, because they will prioritize enduring constitutionalism over transient policies. They will realize, too, that maintaining legislative authority, which is more immediately responsive to local concerns, serves their own interests as well.

Finally, some group among a Madisonian people will have the foresight to step off the cynical and anti-constitutional carousel according to which President George W. Bush did it so Mr. Obama could do it so Mr. Trump might as well, too.

None of this excuses members of Congress from their duties, which sometimes include withstanding public opinion. Even the Democratic justification for an override vote sure to fail is, as the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, put it, to create a record so the issue can be resolved by the courts.

To her credit, Ms. Pelosi did say that “we are Article I, the first branch of government.” But she was less reticent about executive power when Mr. Obama acted unilaterally on immigration. In both cases, the House should have defended its constitutional turf. It is no solution — on the contrary, it presents its own constitutional problems — for one party to ask the courts to provide the institutional protection the whole House declined to provide itself.

As for the Senate, one purpose of its members’ six-year terms is to enable what Madison called “great firmness” in resisting public whims and defending constitutional principles. So much for that. Every legislator is accountable for how he or she votes on the emergency declaration, but Madison expected those immediately facing re-election to capitulate more easily to public opinion. There are worse political sins. Harsher criticism should be reserved for senators who caved without facing immediate electoral consequences.

But their constituents who demanded this constitutional surrender — especially those who profess fidelity to the Constitution as the bedrock of their politics — deserve the sternest rebuke. It is an axiom of republican politics that everyone incurs criticism sooner or later, except the people. Yet if the people care solely about expediency at the expense of law, we are in a “wretched situation” from which the Constitution will not rescue us.

      <TEXT>2014: Russia sends troops into Ukraine and occupies the Crimean Peninsula. That helps set in motion a chain of events that brings us to here. “I call it the Russian witch hunt.” The public release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report, the investigation into whether people associated with Donald Trump’s campaign — “Lock him up!” — conspired with Russia in 2016 — “It’s a whole big fat hoax.” and whether Trump or his aides tried to obstruct this investigation. “The people doing that investigation, they’re dirty cops.” So how did we get here, from this to this? “There was no collusion, there’s no Russia.” O.K., starting with Crimea, Russia enters and eventually annexes the region from Ukraine. The U.S. supports Ukraine’s government, so the U.S. responds with sanctions. “To impose a cost on Russia.” Russia decides to strike back to undermine U.S. democracy. “Show me what hypocrisy looks like!” How? Use America’s polarized politics to turn people against each other. “Don’t shoot!” Perfect timing, because it’s 2015, and here comes the presidential election. The months tick by. Trump does well. “I consider myself the presumptive nominee.” Then several members of his campaign get approached by people with ties to Russia. Those people claim to have information that can hurt the Hillary Clinton campaign. See, the Russians don’t like Clinton. They don’t want her to become president. They say that she meddled in Russian affairs when she was secretary of state. But Trump — “Wouldn’t it be nice if we actually got along with Russia?” Then we learned that Russian hackers had infiltrated the Democratic National Committee’s computer system. And just over a month later, Wikileaks publishes 20,000 hacked Democratic emails. All of this makes the F.B.I. more suspicious of Russian meddling and suspicious of ties between Trump campaign aides and Moscow. Trump’s campaign chairman at the time, Paul Manafort, denies this. “We have no relationship.” The F.B.I. investigates. Then — election victory, and the stakes get higher. President Obama gets ready to leave office. But before he does — “The Russians were responsible for hacking the D.N.C.” — he announces new sanctions on Russia. Enter Michael Flynn, Trump’s soon-to-be national security adviser. He urges Russia’s U.S. ambassador from Moscow not to retaliate over those Obama sanctions. Russia agrees. That’s a problem because Trump hasn’t been inaugurated yet. Flynn isn’t part of the U.S. government. He may have broken federal law by doing this. Then — “So help me God.” Soon Flynn has to resign because he misled the vice president and others — “I was disappointed.” — about those conversations with the Russian ambassador. These chats become part of the F.B.I. investigation into Russian ties with the Trump campaign. The day after Flynn resigns, Trump meets with F.B.I. Director James Comey. According to Comey, Trump asked him to stop investigating Flynn. “I took it as this is what he wants me to do.” Three months after that meeting, Trump fires Comey. According to the White House — “He fired him because he was not fit to do the job. It’s that simple.” Eight days later, the Justice Department taps former F.B.I. Director Robert Mueller to lead the investigation now that Comey is gone. His inquiry now includes Comey’s firing. Did Trump try to obstruct the investigation by asking Comey to stop investigating Flynn? Let’s move ahead to five months after Mueller took the job. He begins charging several Trump associates with a variety of crimes, like lying to the F.B.I. and bank fraud. See, that’s important because they may have information that helps Mueller’s investigation. He can offer them lesser punishments in exchange for that information. Now it’s been almost 11 months since Mueller took over the investigation. And who gets caught up in this? Michael Cohen, Trump’s personal lawyer. He’s mostly charged with crimes that aren’t part of the Mueller investigation. “Mr. Cohen will continue to cooperate.” But Mueller wants to talk to him to see if he knows anything about Trump business dealings in Russia while Trump was running for president. “How do you feel about you may have changed an election?” By the time Cohen testifies before Congress, it’s clear he’s done being loyal to Trump. “He is a racist. He is a con man. And he is a cheat.” And so we come to the present, about five years since Russia annexed Crimea. The investigation — “You wouldn’t oversee a witch hunt, would you?” — speculation — “There was no anything, so that’s the nice part.” — and anticipation — “Robert Mueller may be ready to submit his findings.” — are all in the past. Only the future will tell us how the Mueller report will go down in American history.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The primary suspect in the shooting aboard a Dutch tram that left three people dead and five wounded confessed on Friday to the attack, and said that he acted alone, prosecutors said.

The public prosecutor’s office has said that it intends to bring terrorism charges against the suspect, Gokmen Tanis, in the attack Monday morning in the city of Utrecht, the Netherlands, but it is also investigating whether he had other motives.

Mr. Tanis confessed in a closed court hearing on Friday, the office said — his first appearance in court since he was arrested hours after the shooting. The judge ordered him held for 14 days, the maximum allowed in an initial hearing, but pretrial detention can be extended up to 90 days.

“The 37-year-old suspect admitted to a judge the criminal facts he was suspected of. He also testified that he acted alone,” prosecutors said in a statement. “It is in the best interest of the investigation not to say anything further about his testimony.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Finding the money for a down payment is one of the biggest challenges facing first-time home buyers. At 20 percent of the sale price, the standard down payment can amount to a lot of cash. But buyers who receive a loan under the Federal Housing Administration may need to come up with as little as 3.5 percent.

The share of buyers able to obtain those loans in the 50 largest metropolitan areas across the country was one of the factors taken into account in a recent study by Lending Tree, which ranked those cities in terms of how hospitable they are to first-time buyers.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>MELBOURNE, Australia — Dozens of prominent Australian news outlets and journalists have been ordered to appear in court to answer allegations that they violated a gag order barring coverage of the trial of Cardinal George Pell, a former Vatican official who was convicted in December of molesting children.

Among those summoned to appear in a Melbourne court on April 15 were editors and reporters for Fairfax Media, which owns The Age, The Sydney Morning Herald and The Financial Review, and for Nationwide News, which is owned by News Corp. They could face fines and possibly prison time.

Some of the news outlets themselves were also named in the summons. “I’ve never seen so many media organizations and journalists charged in one hit,” said Jason Bosland, director of the Center for Media and Communications Law at Melbourne Law School.

Chief Judge Peter Kidd, who presided over Cardinal Pell’s trial in the County Court of Victoria, imposed a suppression order on journalists who were covering it, on the grounds that news reports could prejudice a jury in what was then expected to be the second of two trials.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>HONG KONG — I knew that the junta running Thailand wanted to stay in power, but I cannot believe how far it has gone to manipulate the general election on Sunday. I’m surprised, even going by the standards set by this government, and I don’t think I’m the only Thai to be.

The election commission stopped releasing results on Sunday night and announced that it would postpone delivering them until Monday afternoon. The numbers that were disclosed kept changing. As of Monday evening, as I was writing this, official preliminary results had yet to be disclosed. I don’t think there has ever been such a delay in Thailand’s modern history. The junta clearly is afraid.

In some areas, the number of ballots seemed to exceed the number of voters. In others, voter turnout was reported to be 200 percent. The national election commission issued results for some constituencies that didn’t match those reported by officials at the polling stations. A suspiciously large number of ballots were invalidated. There also were reports that some ballots, although marked improperly, were counted as votes for Palang Pracharat, the military’s proxy party.

The election commission has the authority to issue penalties known as red cards to candidates for wrongdoing. It deserves one itself.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Samia was an influencer before she could talk.

Her parents, Adam and LaToya Ali, are influencers themselves and began chronicling Samia’s impending arrival on YouTube and Instagram in 2014, once Ms. Ali learned she was pregnant.

“Samia’s birth video is on YouTube, so she’s pretty much been born into social media,” Mr. Ali said.

Samia is now 4 and has 143,000 followers on Instagram and 203,000 subscribers on YouTube. Her feeds are mostly populated with posts of her posing and playing, but they also feature paid promotions for brands like Crayola and HomeStyle Harvest chicken nuggets.

There are instances when “Samia can’t verbatim get the message out,” Mr. Ali , who lives in the Atlanta area, said of the promotional posts. “Sometimes, their talking points are not kid talk, so LaToya would need to appear, or myself, to relay those because those are key deliverables that the brands want.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused Cuba and Russia on Monday of propping up President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela in the Trump administration’s most explicit argument yet that his government is a dictatorial regime kept alive by two American adversaries.

Mr. Pompeo’s comments came amid a devastating power outage that has plunged many of Venezuela’s most populous areas into darkness, spoiling food in a nation where little is available.

He denied Mr. Maduro’s accusation that foreign powers — a clear reference to the United States — had any role in creating the blackout that has brought the country to the brink of social implosion. Instead, Mr. Pompeo said, the blame lies squarely with Havana and Moscow.

“When there is no electricity, thank the marvels of modern Cuban-led engineering,” Mr. Pompeo said in comments laced with sarcasm. “When there’s no water, thank the excellent hydrologists from Cuba. When there’s no food, thank the Cuban communist overlords.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>A previously unknown photograph of Harriet Tubman, the abolitionist leader known as the “Moses of her people,” is on display for the first time in Washington.

The photograph, on view at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture, is significant because it shows a young Tubman casually seated in a chair wearing an elegant dress with an elaborate bodice and full skirt. Other surviving photographs of Tubman show her looking stern or pensive and, in her later years, frail and wan.

“What this photograph does is humanize Harriet Tubman,” said Lonnie G. Bunch III, the founding director of the museum. “The photograph shows her stylish and in the vibrancy of her youth.”

Tubman, whose original name was Araminta Ross, was born into slavery in Dorchester County, Md., in the early 1820s. She would later come to be known for her work guiding enslaved people to freedom via the Underground Railroad, a loosely connected network of abolitionists who monitored safe houses where fugitives were sheltered on their journey north to free states.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>LONDON — Britain has waited for nine months, since Meghan Markle married Prince Harry in a frothy, celebrity-packed confection of a wedding, to see what the new Duchess of Sussex wanted to talk about.

The answer, it emerged on Friday, was — at least in part — menstruation.

At a panel convened by the Queen’s Commonwealth Trust in honor of International Women’s Day, the duchess said self-consciousness around the topic hurts young women in many developing countries, who can be withdrawn from school or forced to use “old rags, literally,” because they cannot get sanitary pads.

“At the end of the day, we’re doing our part just to normalize the conversation,” she said. “That’s the first step. This is 50 percent of the population that’s affected by something, that can also end up creating the most beautiful thing in the world. So it’s a strange one that it’s ended up becoming so stigmatized.”

It was the first lengthy, unscripted appearance since the wedding for Ms. Markle, who is now one of the most scrutinized women in the world. A central question about her adjustment to life as a member of the royal family is how she — an outspoken, 37-year-old American professional woman — will manage the traditional royal ban on expressing opinions on political matters.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>KANDAHAR, Afghanistan — Taliban suicide bombers penetrated a key government military base in southern Afghanistan on Friday, in a major attack that inflicted heavy casualties on the eve of the latest round of Afghan peace talks, local authorities said.

The early-morning assault came as American and Taliban negotiators prepared to resume peace talks in Doha, Qatar, on Saturday after a two-day break.

Afghanistan’s Ministry of Defense reported at least 23 members of the Afghan security forces were killed and 16 were wounded during an hourslong siege of Camp Shorab military compound in Helmand Province. Eight suicide bombers and numerous other attackers were involved, it said.

Mirza Hussain Alizada, a member of the Helmand provincial council, put the death toll higher, saying up to 40 Afghan soldiers were killed.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Princess Lili B broke both front legs while training. As is common after such injuries to horses, she was euthanized. The 22 deaths since Dec. 26 are more than the total number of deaths, 20 over 122 racing days, in 2017, according to Jockey Club data.

The track has been shut down twice this year and remains suspended for racing.

The track’s policy changes came after a bill, the Horseracing Integrity Act of 2019, was introduced in Congress on Thursday by Representatives Paul Tonko, Democrat of New York, and Andy Barr, Republican of Kentucky. The bill would create a private, independent authority, the Horseracing Anti-Doping and Medication Control Authority, responsible for developing and administering a nationwide antidoping and medication control program for horse racing.

The industry has resisted such changes for decades, and Santa Anita’s spike in fatalities once again put the sport’s lack of meaningful oversight in the spotlight. The Stronach Group, under pressure from animal rights groups as well as horse trainers, apparently had little choice but to take drastic measures to deflect blame.

“We will wait no longer for the industry to come together as one to institute these changes,” the company’s statement said. “Nor will we wait for the legislation required to undertake this paradigm shift. We are taking a stand and fully recognize just how disruptive this might be.”

Kathy Guillermo, a senior vice president for PETA, the animal rights group, said, “This groundbreaking plan will not bring back the 22 horses who have died recently, but it will prevent the deaths of many more and will set a new standard for racing that means less suffering for thoroughbreds.”

With the Kentucky Derby less than eight weeks away, neither animal rights activists nor casual sports fans have the stomach to see a horse be put down after a catastrophic injury. Ever since the Kentucky Derby in 2008, when the filly Eight Belles had to be euthanized after finishing second, racing officials have worried that another high-profile breakdown could put the sport out of business.

In a 2012 series, The New York Times showed that 24 horses died each week at racetracks across America, many of them because of over-medication or a lack of regulatory protection. It prompted meaningful regulations across the United States that led to a decline in the death rate.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WASHINGTON — Cassius Winston held the ball and ran with it as time expired, looking more like an elusive Michigan State running back than a point guard as he evaded all last-second attempts to foul him. The top overall seed, the one with the most dominant freshman in years, was about to fall.

Winston had just played every second of the game. With 20 points and 10 assists, the junior was the second-seeded Spartans’ best player against top-seeded Duke in Sunday’s regional final.

But without heroics from all its players, Michigan State would have been merely forgettable roadkill on Duke’s inexorable path.

There was Xavier Tillman. With just over a minute left, he scored 5 points on two shots and a free throw, cutting the deficit to 1 point.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>FOXBOROUGH, Mass. — Robert K. Kraft’s New England Patriots are a very good football team, having won six Super Bowl championships the past 19 years. They are 33-5 against the A.F.C. East division rival Buffalo Bills during that span.

In a cruel twist of fate, Robert Kraft’s other team that plays at Gillette Stadium, the New England Revolution, might as well be the Buffalo Bills of Major League Soccer. There was a run of dominance — four M.L.S. Cup Finals appearances in six years — without a championship, and a mostly fallow period now going on a decade. The team is below .500 (125-148-89) since 2008, the year after it went to its third straight M.L.S. Cup Finals.

Kraft has bigger concerns at the moment than the Revolution. He is facing two misdemeanor charges of soliciting prostitution at a massage parlor in Jupiter, Fla. (Kraft denies illegal activity.) Kraft most likely won’t face jail time, but the charges could result in a fine or a suspension or both from the National Football League, where he has become one of the most powerful owners, and from Major League Soccer, where he also enjoys a long, close relationship with the commissioner.</TEXT>

Whom else should New York City honor?

My colleague Ginia Bellafante, who has written extensively about gender and the city, told me that “the city shouldn’t get too self-congratulatory about all of this,” referring to the new statues.

The city, she said, should focus not just on women who are famous pioneers, but its fameless everyday heroes.

“New York worships too hard at the altar of exceptionalism,” she said, adding that people should be reminded of the millions of women who keep the city running.

So, which women should we be celebrating?

“The struggling mom who has three jobs and travels an hour to get her kid to a great school every day; the nannies and cleaning women who make it possible for affluent women to go to work in hospitals, courtrooms, universities, law firms; the home health aides and preschool teachers and waitresses who keep everything humming.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea has started rebuilding the facilities it uses to launch satellites into orbit and test engines and other technologies for its intercontinental ballistic missile program, according to American military analysts and South Korean intelligence officials.

The revelation comes days after the breakdown of the second summit meeting between the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, and President Trump last week in Hanoi, Vietnam. It could be a first sign that North Korea is preparing to end its moratorium on missile tests, which Mr. Trump has claimed as a major diplomatic achievement.

North Korea began dismantling the Sohae Satellite Launching Station in Tongchang-ri near its northwestern border with China last summer, after Mr. Kim held his first meeting with Mr. Trump in June in Singapore. It partially took down an engine test site, a rocket launchpad and a rail-mounted building used by engineers to assemble launch vehicles and move them to the launchpad.

The North did not completely dismantle the facilities, and when Mr. Kim met with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea in September, he offered to destroy them in the presence of American experts.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>A member of the Ghazni provincial council, Hassan Riza Yusufi, gave a higher toll, saying 15 police officers had been killed and six others wounded. Mr. Yusufi identified the dead chief as Mujiburrahman Andarabi, whose police district was one of three in Ghazni.

Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban spokesman, sent a message to a group of journalists claiming responsibility for the attack on the insurgents’ behalf. He said the Taliban had killed six police officers and captured a seventh, then killed 10 Afghan soldiers who had been sent to rescue the police. His claims could not be independently confirmed.

Mr. Noori said the Taliban had also sustained heavy casualties, but he gave no specifics.

In the week that ended on Thursday, at least 98 members of the pro-government forces in Afghanistan were killed. That included four Afghan Special Forces soldiers and two Americans with a Special Forces unit, all killed in the same operation in Kunduz Province in the north.

In all, four American soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan this year. Hundreds of members of the Afghan security forces have been killed, in most cases when their bases were overrun by insurgents.

Mohammad Musa Akhlaqi, a member of Parliament from Ghazni Province, said that there had been two consecutive nights of Taliban attacks in the city and that officials had asked the Afghan defense minister for extra help.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>TAIPEI, Taiwan — Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, will travel to the South Pacific on Thursday to shore up ties with three island nations that still recognize Taiwan as a country, in an effort to offset China’s expanding influence in the region.

Only 17 countries recognize Taiwan’s government, and among those, Ms. Tsai will be visiting Palau, Nauru and the Marshall Islands.

China has been pouring aid and investment into the Pacific islands, raising the question of whether Beijing could strip Taiwan of more of its few remaining diplomatic allies and shrink the self-ruled island’s international presence.

The Trump administration has sought to push back against China’s reach in the South Pacific and Latin America. Australia is also concerned, and last year set aside more money in its budget for Pacific aid.</TEXT>

First the pilot, Wing Cmdr. Abhinandan Varthaman, was soaring through the sky in a MiG-21 on Wednesday. Then he was shot down by Pakistani forces.

After parachuting into enemy territory and being surrounded by a mob, he tried to eat some of the documents he was carrying, according to Indian news media reports. He was then badly beaten before being rescued by Pakistani troops.

But that wasn’t the end of it. Over the next few days, videos of him being interrogated in Pakistani custody spread on social media around the world.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>One of YouTube’s biggest celebrities found himself entangled early Friday in news coverage of the mass shooting at two mosques in New Zealand.

A gunman who had broadcast part of the attack that left at least 49 people dead urged those watching to “subscribe to PewDiePie,” referring to the alias used by Felix Kjellberg, a Swede whose channel has long dominated YouTube and courted controversy along the way.

Mr. Kjellberg was quick to distance himself from the shooting.

“I feel absolutely sickened having my name uttered by this person,” he said on Twitter. “My heart and thoughts go out to the victims, families and everyone affected by this tragedy.”

Mr. Kjellberg is no stranger to controversy. In recent years, he has been embraced by some on the far right and faced criticism for his use of anti-Semitic imagery and racist and sexist language. Here is a closer look at PewDiePie and the New Zealand gunman’s words.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>BEIJING — A senior official from China’s far west said on Tuesday that the internment camps for Muslim minorities there were like boarding schools and that their numbers of inmates would shrink, as the government pushed back against international criticism of the mass detentions.

China’s sweeping confinement of Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang region has drawn condemnation from foreign governments and international bodies, including in recent weeks. A United States envoy called it part of a “war with faith.” Turkey, once quiet about the detentions, has become critical. The United Nations high commissioner for human rights recently demanded answers.

Yet at the annual meeting of China’s national legislature, which began last month, Communist Party officials from Xinjiang appeared serenely unbowed about the policies.

Foreign experts, citing satellite images and government documents, have estimated that the camps have held without trial as many as a million Uighurs, Kazakhs and other Muslims in a program that tries to turn them into loyal, Chinese-speaking supporters of the party.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>In any divorce, lawyers are the only surefire winners, and as Britain muddles through one of the biggest, messiest and most complicated breakups in economic history, the country’s top law firms are booming.

Brexit, as Britain’s separation from the European Union is known, is just one of many reasons that the highest-grossing firms are enjoying their best results in a decade. Virtually every practice area is thriving.

Regulatory lawyers, those steeped in the staggering legal minutia produced by Brexit, have lately gone from drudges to rainmakers. These attorneys strategize with clients for life after Europe’s single market, consultations that often end in bewilderment and rage.

“There’s been some swearing, some clients whose faces have drained of color, when they realize the sort of impact this all will have,” said Andrew Hood, a regulatory and trade partner at Fieldfisher, a London-based firm with more than 1,000 lawyers. “And in the last six weeks, the number of clients who have woken up worried about what a no-deal Brexit looks like has doubled or tripled.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>KABUL, Afghanistan — He was their nightmare, the young, female Afghan soccer players say: a menacing 57-year-old with two wives who locked the door to his back office with a biometric keypad that only he could open.

Many of those young soccer players, members of the women’s national team, lined up to accuse the man, the president of Afghan soccer, Keramuddin Keram, of sexually assaulting them in a bed he kept in that room, and elsewhere, charges they made both in public statements and to Afghan prosecutors. Women who rebuffed his advances were labeled lesbians and expelled from the team, according to eight former players who said that had happened to them.

Three months later, however, the investigation into sexual abuse in Afghan soccer is stalled, amid fears it will never proceed. It has yet to result in any criminal charges.

One of Mr. Keram’s accusers, the soccer player Khalida Popal, said he had actively pursued women who testified against him in Afghanistan, warning them to withdraw the charges. And witnesses like her who live in exile have not been interviewed in person by Afghan investigators, as required by law, because so far the investigators have not been able to get visas.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>MAPUTO, Mozambique — Rescue workers struggled Tuesday to reach areas devastated by a huge cyclone in Mozambique, as heavy rains swelled rivers and further isolated flooded communities in what aid agencies called the worst natural disaster in southern Africa in two decades.

In central Mozambique, the area hit hardest by Cyclone Idai, overflowing rivers created “an inland ocean” where countless people were still marooned, a United Nations official said.

Rescue workers reported seeing people on rooftops and in trees days after the storm struck. In areas near the rivers, homes were submerged, with water rising near the tops of telephone poles.

“We took an aerial survey, and as far as the eye can see, there was flooding, and deep as well,” said Jamie LeSueur, who was leading rescue efforts in central Mozambique for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. “What we are now facing is large-scale flooding on top of an area already devastated by the cyclone.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Airplanes, with their cramped quarters and crowded conditions, would seem improbable settings for sexual assaults, but recent news accounts show they do happen.

A Detroit-area man who was convicted of sexually assaulting a sleeping passenger during an overnight flight was sentenced to nine years in prison, and two men were charged in separate cases last year. In August, a female passenger described on Twitter how a man masturbated sitting next to her for hours.

And this week, two flight attendants for JetBlue filed a lawsuit in federal court against the airline and two of its pilots, alleging that the pilots drugged both attendants during a layover and that one of the pilots raped one of the women and a co-worker.

Laura Palumbo, communications director at the National Sexual Violence Resource Center in Harrisburg, Pa., said there was every reason to believe that sexual assaults and harassment on flights had started getting increased attention thanks to the #MeToo movement and after a 2016 report that Donald J. Trump, decades before he became president, sexually assaulted a businesswoman on a flight. (He denied the allegation.)</TEXT>

      <TEXT>As New York City has finally begun to exercise oversight over ultra-Orthodox yeshivas that have graduated students without a basic education, some of those Jewish schools have defied city health department scrutiny and helped to feed a measles outbreak. Forty children have contracted measles in recent months, all of the cases linked to a single Brooklyn yeshiva that ignored an order from city health officials to prevent children who hadn’t been vaccinated from attending classes.

Yet that hasn’t stopped yeshiva supporters in Albany from maneuvering to free the schools from government supervision, a reflection of the political pull ultra-Orthodox leaders have come to expect in New York.

Where to begin? How about 2015? That’s when a group of former yeshiva students known as Young Advocates for Fair Education filed a complaint accusing the New York City Department of Education of failing to hold dozens of yeshivas to state education standards, leaving them without a basic command of English, math or science.

There was little urgency in Mayor Bill de Blasio’s response. By last August, more than three years later , the city had inspected only half of the 30 yeshivas in the complaint that were still operating. Thanks to a push last year from the new schools chancellor, Richard Carranza, all are expected to be visited by the end of the month. City officials say that none of those visited have failed state education standards, but the city still needs to detail to the public what it finds.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Ralph Hall, a Texas Republican who was the oldest member in the history of the House of Representatives, died on Thursday at his home in Rockwall, Tex. He was 95.

His death was announced by Ed Valentine, his longtime strategist.

Mr. Hall was 91 when he left the House after 34 years. He was defeated in a Republican primary runoff in 2014 by John Ratcliffe, a former United States attorney less than half his age.

An avid jogger who began his days with two-mile runs, Mr. Hall celebrated Memorial Day 2012, when he was 89, by skydiving. That Christmas he became the oldest member of the House, breaking the record set by Charles Manly Stedman of North Carolina, who died in office in 1930 at the age of 89 years, seven months and 25 days.

Only three United States senators were older than Mr. Hall while still serving. The South Carolina Republican Strom Thurmond was 100 when he retired in 2003; the Rhode Island Democrat Theodore Francis Green was 93 when he left the Senate in 1961; and the West Virginia Democrat Robert Byrd died in office at 92 in 2010.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>FRIDAY PUZZLE — Even though making a themeless crossword puzzle can, in some circumstances, be easier than constructing a themed one, there are still uphill battles to fight to put a good themeless together.

In Martin Ashwood-Smith’s case, the battle was to stack long entries on top of each other while keeping the crossings clean. It takes a lot of practice to be able to stretch stacked entries across a grid and still have the Downs make sense or be in the language.

In this puzzle, Mr. Ashwood-Smith gave himself some slack by limiting himself to a central staggered stack of 13s, with some shorter stacks in the northeast and the southwest. But with this grid design, he still has to find four interesting long Downs to connect the sectors of his puzzle. Even without something with the visual derring-do of a quadruple stack, it’s still a balancing act between including really sparkling entries and not including too much glue, like Roman numerals (XII), although it’s clued gently as a number on a grandfather clock. And, admittedly, that’s a personal peeve of mine. Some solvers might not mind it.

So has he succeeded? I believe so. There is some lively fill in his puzzle, including debuts like GLISSANDI, TORE APART, BARRY GIBB, DOUBTFIRE and JARED LETO, a familiar name to solvers who appears under his full name for the first time. Other entries, like ILL AT EASE, DIXIELAND JAZZ, DOUBLE DEALERS, DRAG DOWN and MALADROIT, hold the grid together and make the solve fun.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>MEXICO CITY — Popocatépetl, the active volcano that rises some 40 miles southeast of the Mexican capital, exploded Monday night, sending a plume of ash and gas more than two miles into the inky sky and raining glowing rocks onto its slopes.

Video released by Mexico’s national disaster prevention agency showed a fiery light at the volcano’s crater at 9:38 p.m. The explosion was quickly enveloped in ash and pulverized rock as burning fragments of the volcano’s dome fell over a radius of a mile and a half.

Popocatépetl, whose name means “smoking mountain” in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs, sprang back to life in 1994 after a half-century of quiescence. Since then, the residents of the surrounding towns have grown accustomed to frequent emissions of gas and ash and periodic eruptions.

Over the past few weeks, the volcano has become more active, prompting the authorities to repeat warnings to keep a distance of about seven miles away from the summit.</TEXT>

He believes in white supremacy and has repeatedly denigrated immigrants who provide a crucial work force in his district.

Mr. King, it is not just the “national news medi a” that cares about your blatant racist views. It is every Iowan and American who believes in the equality of all people. We will not quietly enable your hatred or the violence incited by its sympathizers.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Research that could make flu viruses more dangerous, and that the government suspended i n 2014 because of safety concerns, has been approved to begin again, federal officials have confirmed.

The government did not publicly announce its decisions in recent months to allow two labs to resume their projects. The new go-ahead was first reported in the journal Science.

The lack of information about the decision and how it was made have provoked outrage from some scientists, who oppose the research because they say it could create mutant viruses that might cause deadly pandemics if they were unleashed by lab accidents or terrorism. The research sparked worldwide fears when it was first revealed in 2011.

Two research teams, in Wisconsin and the Netherlands, have been told by the Department of Health and Human Services that their work is eligible for research funding from the United States government. The Wisconsin group was notified in October, and the Dutch group in January, a spokeswoman for H.H.S. said in an email.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The number of pedestrians killed in traffic in the United States is approaching a three-decade high, contributing to what has been an “alarming rise” in such deaths in recent years, according to a new study.

An estimated 6,227 pedestrians were killed in traffic in 2018, according to the study from the Governors Highway Safety Association, a projection based on data from the first half of the year. That figure represents a striking rise from a decade earlier, when 4,109 pedestrians were killed in traffic.

“I’ve been in this business for 36 years and I’ve never seen a pattern like this,” said Richard Retting, who wrote the report and has worked in a variety of traffic engineering and safety roles for the New York City Department of Transportation, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and other federal and local transportation agencies.

The report cited alcohol use, speeding, unsafe infrastructure and the prevalence of SUVs as some of the biggest problems contributing to the fatalities. It also suggested that the increased use of smartphones may contribute to such deaths.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“There is no ownership of the issue by the government,” said Anna Wicha, a director at the Adecco Group, one of the largest employment agencies in Poland. “You ask how many Ukrainians are working here and they will say 500,000. But it is more than two million. And many may be going to Germany.”

For now, the government lacks a long-term strategy to expand the labor pool. Many experts and some opposition politicians in Poland say the situation will only be resolved if political leaders soften their resistance to migrants and embrace plurality. But at the national level, even talking about immigration can be politically lethal.

When Pawel Chorazy, the deputy minister of investments and development, said during a televised debate before the October local elections that “the inflow of immigrants to Poland needs to be increased to sustain economic growth,” he was met with scorn.

Joachim Brudzinski, the interior minister, said that Mr. Chorazy’s comments were “not a position of the government.” The prime minister, Mr. Morawiecki, said that Mr. Chorazy “got seriously ahead of himself.”

Then he fired him.

“Politicians are dancing on the line, well aware that you can wake up demons,” said Irena Kotowska, head of the center for demography at the Warsaw School of Economics. “It is easy to play into nationalist feeling with anti-immigrant rhetoric. But the reality of the need in the labor market is more and more clear every day.”

“This is a defining moment for the country,” she added. “Some decisions simply have to be made.”

Here in the central city of Lodz, the contradictions of Poland’s migration dilemma are evident. Unlike national leaders, however, the local mayor, Hanna Zdanowska, has embraced immigrants. When she ran last October, she called for an inclusive Poland that welcomed newcomers.

The governing party campaigned hard against her, but she won with 70 percent of the vote, which she credited in part to the city’s history of tolerance. It was once a manufacturing center of hundreds of red brick factories, with a diverse population of Dutch, English and German residents, and a strong Jewish contingent.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>It’s impossible for me to catalog all the times I’ve been in a professional setting when someone thought it appropriate to tell me about my appearance.

Most recently, I was at a literary festival in Georgia. I had just talked about my book for a little under an hour: the 10 years of work I’d put into it, the research I conducted to feel confident inventing a cult of domestic terrorists, and the personal grief and loss underlying the novel. In the signing line afterward, a woman complimented me on my remarks and said she was excited about my book. Then she added: “You’re adorable. I wish I could adopt you.” With a big smile, she walked away.

There was also the bookstore event at which, during the question-and-answer portion of the evening — and in front of a packed crowd with whom I’d just been discussing craft, books, literature — a woman told me how cute she thought I was. There’s the time I guest-taught at a graduate program, and a fellow professor called me and my friend — both of us on the faculty and both of us Asian-American — “little lambs.” There are the innumerable times professional colleagues, people I barely know, strangers even, have told me my skin is alabaster, and my hair silklike and shiny. My skin’s not especially pale, and even if it were, this would be weird, and diminishing. It’s objectifying.

Why is it so weird, you might be wondering. Aside from the colorist comments about my skin, some of these words — adorable, cute, silky, shiny — could be taken, incorrectly, as compliments. I acknowledge that there’s luck, and privilege, in inhabiting a body that others might find appealing. But when I’m at these events, I am at work. I am talking about my profession, not about my hair or skin or any perceived cuteness.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>… and then head for the neighborhoods.

Nearly 40 percent of Milwaukeeans are African-American, and a museum exploring black history and the legacy of slavery, called America’s Black Holocaust Museum, is hoping to reopen in 2019. Some of the older neighborhoods around the city have transformed in recent decades, like Bay View, which is now a hub for art and good eating. Younger people are spurring change, said Jennifer and Michael Wolf, who were having lunch there on Monday. “The generational shift in Milwaukee has been huge,” said Ms. Wolf, adding that the city has lately become cleaner, more focused on the arts and friendlier to bicyclists.

Still, Milwaukee remains one of the most segregated cities in the country. Arthur Talley, 60, a factory worker who was running errands downtown, said race relations had hardly improved since he was a child growing up there. “We’re still marginalized,” he said. “People see two or three African-Americans coming down the street, and they cross the street to avoid us.”

Embrace the old and the new. Sometimes at once.

Milwaukee doesn’t like to throw things away. On the old Pabst factory campus, there are now loft apartments. Domestic sales at Milwaukee-based Harley-Davidson have slipped, but the city’s motorcycling culture is thriving at the Iron Horse Hotel, a warehouse-turned-luxurious-hotel with a special station for washing your Harley.

And there is still a certain fondness here for anything set in Milwaukee. Along the riverfront is a statue of the “Happy Days” television character played by Henry Winkler, known as the Bronze Fonz.

Here are some handy phrases to say (and not say).

Words to strike from your vocabulary upon arrival: “Rust Belt,” a term that Milwaukeeans are likely to think is dated and vaguely insulting; “heartland,” a word that is rarely used by someone who is actually from the so-called heartland; and “Midwestern Nice.” (The proper term is “Minnesota Nice,” and it doesn’t mean nice, exactly — it’s sort of the Midwestern equivalent of “bless your heart.”)

The ethos of Wisconsin is a little different than what some visitors may be used to at home. Wisconsinites tend to smile a little more at strangers, make small talk in elevators and chat about the weather to fill silences. Milwaukeeans are especially ebullient during the (brief) summers, when the city is humming with festivals at churches and along the lakefront.

Marty Ordinans, a lifelong Milwaukeean who works at a technical college, said he hoped convention visitors would share the experience of his son’s girlfriend, a native Californian who recently ventured to Wisconsin for a visit. “She had a nice time,” he said. “And she kept saying she was struck by how friendly people were.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Aware of the rising rents, Ms. Bonstin said affordable housing was a priority for the city. “Many projects have a component of affordable housing,” she said, noting that the Weingart Center for the Homeless was putting up two towers that would classify all units as affordable.

Mr. Griffin believes that the growth projections will easily be surpassed, and that downtown could become a city within a city, with as many 200,000 residents in the next 21 years. Already, he said, there are an estimated 70,000, up from 18,000 20 years ago.

“The catalyst for the transformation of Downtown L.A. is the residential development,” said Bert Dezzutti , the executive vice president for the Western region of Brookfield Properties, the district’s largest real estate owner. “Once it establishes itself as a residential destination, it drives the other uses.”

Brookfield has a few developments in the works, including a residential tower next to its Figat7th shopping center, as well as a $170 million overhaul and modernization of the California Market Center in the downtown’s fashion district.

Mr. Dezzutti believes he’ll have little trouble renting out the 780 residential units planned for the high-rise at 755 South Figueroa Street, where construction is set to commence in the second quarter. “The demand is extremely strong, and really there is virtually no appreciable vacancy today.” (By the downtown center BID’s account, it’s under 10 percent.)

A significant portion of the new DTLA development has been driven by foreign investment.

“There’s a high concentration of high-profile property that is foreign owned or developed,” said Michael Soto , the research manager for the Southern California district of the Transwestern Development Company. Mr. Soto, who has been tracking downtown development for more than a decade, said foreign entities “look at L.A. as an attractive place to invest and a gateway city with a diversified economy.”

Duncan Wlodarczak , the chief of staff for the Onni Group of Vancouver, British Columbia, said his company saw untapped value in the downtown when it began looking for potential investments about a decade ago.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“Immigration is managed by criminals and should be blocked by any legal means necessary,” Mr. Salvini was quoted as saying by the Italian news agency ANSA.

Humanitarian organizations say that migrants are mistreated and even tortured in Libya, and have protested protocols to return migrants who have been rescued offshore. Italy and Malta have refused to open their ports to humanitarian ships that rescue migrants at sea, creating numerous standoffs as European governments haggle over which one will take people in.

Mediterranea, a private group that operates a rescue ship and monitors how governments treat migrants, urged compassion for the group on the hijacked vessel and said it hoped European countries would act “in the name of fundamental rights, remembering that we are dealing with human beings fleeing hell.”

Mass migration to Europe has dropped sharply since 2015, when more than one million people from the Middle East, Asia and Africa fled to the Continent. The surge created a humanitarian crisis, with many desperate travelers drowning and arrival spots such as Italy and Greece struggling to house large numbers of asylum seekers.

Along with the dangerous sea journey itself, those who try to cross the Mediterranean risk being stopped by the Libyan Coast Guard, which transfers them to detention centers where human rights groups say they are routinely subjected to abuse.

European Union members “alert the Libyan Coast Guard when refugees and migrants are spotted at sea so they can be taken back to Libya, despite knowing that people there are arbitrarily detained and exposed to widespread torture, rape, killings and exploitation,” said Matteo de Bellis, an international migration researcher for Amnesty International.

European Union countries, responding to domestic opposition to welcoming immigrants, have significantly diminished operations in the Mediterranean, withdrawing their ships and limiting the mission to air surveillance.

“This shameful decision has nothing to do with the needs of people who risk their lives at sea, but everything to do with the inability of European governments to agree on a way to share responsibility for them,” Mr. de Bellis said.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>New York City braced on Sunday for a winter storm that was expected to bring five to eight inches of snow, with northern parts of Queens, Upper Manhattan and the Bronx expected to see the most accumulation.

The storm was forecast to start around 9 p.m. Sunday and last until 4 a.m. Monday. The city will receive about an inch of precipitation every hour during that time and there is a chance of lingering showers during the morning rush on Monday, city officials said.

“The morning commute will be problematic, there’s no doubt about that,” said Joseph J. Esposito, commissioner of the New York City Emergency Management Department.

The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning effective from 1 p.m. Sunday to 7 a.m. Monday for northeastern New Jersey, southern Connecticut and parts of southeastern New York, including New York City.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>A small group of Republican strategists opposed to President Trump, branding themselves Defending Democracy Together, quietly conducted polling and focus groups last fall to gauge whether the president was vulnerable to a primary challenge in 2020. Assembling a presentation for sympathetic political donors, they listed points of weakness for Mr. Trump such as “tweeting/temperament” and “criminality/corruption.”

The group concluded that Mr. Trump’s scandals were not yet badly damaging him with Republican-leaning voters: “Even relatively high information voters aren’t paying particularly close attention to day-to-day scandals,” the presentation stated. But it added that there was “room to educate voters” on the subject.

Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s former lawyer, may have begun that education on Wednesday.

With Mr. Cohen’s appearance before a House committee, the public airing of ethical transgressions by Mr. Trump reached a new phase, one that may be harder to ignore for friends and foes alike. The spectacle of Mr. Trump’s onetime enforcer denouncing him in televised proceedings, detailing a catalog of allegations of cruelty and crimes, signaled the pressure the president’s already strained coalition could feel in the coming months as Congress scrutinizes him, and as the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III completes his investigation.

Republicans still find it difficult to imagine that Mr. Trump’s electoral base would ever desert him, though they acknowledge that bond may soon be tested as never before. Mr. Trump’s core supporters — numbering about two in five American voters, polls suggest — have stayed with him through revelations of financial and sexual impropriety, painful electoral setbacks and the longest government shutdown in history.</TEXT>

      <TITLE>The Allure, and Burden, of Private Equity - The New York Times</TITLE>

      <TEXT>“So at any time,” she added, “the most you’ll be out of pocket is between $6.50 and $7.50 out of that $10.”

That dynamic has tripped up some investors who pledged money to private equity funds that was allocated to another investment, hoping their returns would cover the call for more capital.

For investors new to private equity, buying a stakes on the secondary market may be a good entry point, Ms. Auerbach said, because the buyer will have a sense of the fund’s performance and get returns more quickly.

But the question remains: How much do you put into private equity to reap the benefits but avoid the downside? Unfortunately, there is no hard rule like the 60/40 split between stocks and bonds that serves as a baseline for investing in the public markets.

Ms. Auerbach wrote a paper analyzing the private investment strategies of top-performing institutional investors and what individuals could learn from them. She found that most big institutions had at least 15 percent of their portfolio in private investments, with some going more than 40 percent.

She said large, multigenerational families might be able to do the same, given their wealth and ability to remain comfortable with the illiquidity.

Of course, that percentage depends not just on the asset base but also on a family’s spending. Ms. Rosa said clients needed to think about whether they could get returns on their other investments that were high enough to cover their lifestyle while they waited for their private equity investments to mature.

That makes sense, but all those numbers need to be forecast out years, and by that time, the economy may have stalled.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Good Tuesday morning. Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today.
• The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee sent requests for information to 81 agencies, individuals and entities tied to President Trump, opening a broad investigation into possible obstruction, corruption and abuse of power in Mr. Trump’s administration and business empire.
• The National Security Agency has quietly shut down a system used to analyze the logs of Americans’ phone records and text messages to search for terrorists. The program’s disclosure by Edward J. Snowden in 2013 set off intense discussions about privacy and the rule of law.
• Senators who oppose Mr. Trump’s declaration of a national emergency at the southern border have the votes to overturn it. But how big will the margin be? And is this proof that Mr. Trump’s grip on his own party is slipping?</TEXT>

      <TEXT>But Toledo, on Lake Erie just across the Ohio-Michigan border, has had its own connection with the industry for nearly all that time. It is home to the big Jeep plant run by Fiat Chrysler, on a site where vehicles have been produced since 1910. General Motors has built transmissions here since 1916, and the city is home to, and surrounded by, scores of smaller parts plants.

However, the museum itself owes its existence to an industry that was around before cars: glass. Its benefactors were Edward Drummond Libbey and Florence Scott Libbey, members of the family that founded what was to become the Libbey Glass Company in 1818.

Portraits of the museum’s founders hang everywhere in the sprawling main museum building, while a separate building devoted to glass is across the street. In all, there are more than 30,000 works of art, a third of them paintings, a third works on paper, and a third glass objects.

“Mr. Libbey had ambitions that were very, very grand,” said the museum director, Brian Kennedy.

The 40-acre museum campus sits on Monroe Street, surrounded by large, gracious homes and apartment buildings — and the constant rush of traffic.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>When the Islamic State raised its black flag over the Syrian city of Raqqa in early 2014, it began its transformation from fringe regional player to fearsome global threat. By the end of that year, it had seized large stretches of territory in Iraq and Syria, creating a rogue state the size of Britain.

Now, the last of that territory — a sliver of land along the Euphrates River in southeastern Syria — has been retaken. Thousands of fighters remain in the region, but they have gone underground, carrying out quick strikes in the region and continuing to promote their ideology worldwide.

Here are some of the major moments in the group’s evolution:

The Islamic State traces its roots to Al Qaeda in Iraq, an offshoot of the terrorist group that attacked the United States on Sept. 11, 2001. The Iraqi affiliate started an insurgency that pushed Iraq to the brink of civil war in 2006 and 2007, before it suffered defeat at the hands of American troops and local militias.

By 2013, remnants of the Qaeda affiliate had rebranded themselves the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, and had identified opportunities in Syria, which was in the third year of its civil war. The Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, an Iraqi, was the architect of the group’s push to seize territory and declare its own state.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>This was certainly the case for another of my sons. “From the first day of school,” he told me, “I felt different from my classmates.” He described this as a “slightly bad feeling” and said he’d been bullied, something he’d never told me before. For him, difference was not an advantage, it was a burden, and his looks, which are somewhat exotic, were “a card you could play but don’t really want to.” He, too, acknowledged that this exoticism could be an asset, but it was not one he had ever wanted and the price he’d had to pay for it was steep.

My third son had an entirely different take. By the time he was in middle school, he told me, he had recognized that being unusual gave him a social advantage. “I knew it was something that was cool,” he said. He told me that he got a kick out of the fact that people couldn’t pronounce his surname (something that caused his brother endless misery) and observed that the social cred effect had only increased with age.

Despite having grown up in the same family and sharing almost everything in their lives, my sons had very different accounts of what growing up hapa had been like.

At least part of the reason is that they themselves have different strengths and weaknesses, different instincts, different tastes. One’s shyness is a disadvantage in this context, another’s gregariousness is a plus. Birth order also plays a role; it’s harder to be first than third. But of my three sons, only one had enjoyed the unadulterated pleasure at being “difficult to place” that I had so confidently envisioned for them.

I’m kind of amazed at how wrong I got this. I had loved being out of my element, but I had been a grown-up. I had chosen the experience of estrangement, I had traveled on my own to the far side of the world. They, on the other hand, had been children. They had never had any choice in the matter; being different was something that had been foisted upon them.

It’s such an obvious distinction that I wonder now how I failed to see it. Perhaps the answer lies in the way we, as parents, project ourselves onto our children. We forget that they are not us and that their experiences are not ours and that the world they inhabit is different from the one in which we grew up.

They will, however, have other experiences, many of which will have to do with the way the world is changing around them. Hapa kids belong to one of the fastest growing segments of the American population. The percentage of people with mixed ancestry, now estimated at about 7 percent of the population, is expected to triple in the next 30 years.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, has been offered a deal that includes paying a fine and doing community service in return for admitting that if his soliciting prostitution case were to go to trial, the prosecutors would win.

The prosecutors in Palm Beach County, Fla., offered the deal to Mr. Kraft and 24 other men who last month were arrested on misdemeanor charges of buying sex at the Orchids of Asia day spa in Jupiter, Fla.

The police and prosecutors say the massage parlor is the focus of a wider investigation into human sex trafficking in several counties in Florida. Mr. Kraft — who faces two misdemeanor counts — and the other 24 men have been charged only with soliciting prostitution; they have not been charged with any crimes in connection to sex trafficking.

News of the plea offer was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.

The investigation into sex trafficking is still continuing, said Mike Edmondson, a spokesman for the state attorney’s office in Palm Beach County.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“Centrist Democrats Squirm as ’20 Rivals Tilt Left” (front page, March 10) warns that some Democrats fear that they could lose their chance to defeat President Trump by “careening over a liberal cliff .” But the article does not cite a single poll showing that voters will rebel against progressive policies. Instead, it simply recites the dire warnings of “moderates” without giving a shred of evidence to support their fears.

The fact is that many policies dismissed as “liberal cliff” ideas by the Washington establishment are broadly popular. Recently, Elizabeth Warren and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez drew charges of extremism when they proposed much higher taxes on the rich. Then people did polls and — guess what? — both proposals did very well .

Not only are voters more supportive of progressive policies than “moderates” imagine, but as political data geeks could tell you, specific policy positions play a limited role in elections. In 1980, Ronald Reagan’s right-wing policy ideas were far out of the mainstream, but he won, because people were tired of Jimmy Carter. And if Bernie Sanders runs against Donald Trump, voters tired of Mr. Trump will make him president.

As a centrist Democrat, I believe that there is only one thing that Democrats ought to prioritize in 2020, and that is the removal of Donald Trump from office. Instead, they are busily crafting and polishing their dreamy policy positions, all of which Mr. Trump will use against them to great effect, particularly in my part of the country — which has already shown a dreary susceptibility to his wretched message.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>ROME — Pope Francis has rejected the resignation of a French cardinal, the Vatican announced on Tuesday, despite the cardinal’s conviction this month for covering up decades-old allegations of sexual abuse by a priest in his diocese.

A French court found Cardinal Philippe Barbarin, archbishop of Lyon, guilty on March 7 of failing to report abuse to the authorities, and imposed a six-month suspended sentence.

Cardinal Barbarin, 68, promptly offered to resign, though he is appealing the verdict. He met with Pope Francis on Monday to personally hand in his resignation, but both the cardinal and a Vatican spokesman, Alessandro Gisotti, said on Tuesday that the pope had not accepted it.

Instead, they said, the cardinal, one of the highest-ranking and best-known Roman Catholic officials in France, will step aside for an unspecified length of time.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>[Todt Hill, a getaway from the bustling city, offers privacy that has appealed to mob bosses.]

Since the 1990s, the fortunes of the city’s five traditional Mafia clans have been on the decline. Federal and state authorities increased their focus on the mob’s control of certain industries and unions beginning in the 1980s and improved their use of racketeering laws to loosen the mafia’s control. And since eight mob leaders were convicted in 1986 in a federal racketeering trial of operating a commission that ruled the Mafia in the United States, Mafia leaders have avoided the spotlight in fear of coming to the attention of federal and state prosecutors.

By early Thursday morning on Staten Island, the police had strung yellow tape across the street leading to Mr. Cali’s home, a large red-brick, two-story colonial style house whose front door stood open.

Prashant Ranyal, 39, who lives in the neighborhood, said he was shaken by the killing. “Whenever you see nice areas you feel like it’s peaceful,” he added. “When something like this happens you definitely have a second thought about it.”

Salvatore, the other neighbor, said he had lived in his house for 12 years and did not know any of his neighbors, which struck him as unusual. “Nobody talks to nobody around here; it’s crazy,” he said. “People kind of keep to themselves. They like their privacy.”

He described the street where the shooting happened as quiet and full of old homes. “Dead street,’’ he said. “Dead quiet all the time.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WASHINGTON — A beard on his face, a new catcher in front of him and Robinson Cano at his back: Plenty had changed in Jacob deGrom’s world between the time he won the National League Cy Young Award last fall and when he took the mound for the Mets’ season opener on Thursday.

He needed time to reorient himself at first.

His schedule had also been upended in recent days. Coming out of spring training, he had to leave the team to attend a marathon negotiating session in Sarasota, Fla., and had to rearrange his travel schedule so he could undergo a physical examination in New York before he was reunited with his teammates in Washington.

Though the diversions all resulted in a five-year contract extension worth $137.5 million, deGrom said the process had been taxing. He also had unfamiliar jitters.

“I was really nervous,” he said. “There was some pressure on me today.”

DeGrom, who had only a 10-9 record despite a 1.70 earned run average last season, welcomed support from all corners, including from the newcomers, as he worked through an adrenaline rush and early struggles with off-speed pitches for a 2-0 win over the Nationals.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Sidney Jay Sheinberg was born on Jan. 14, 1935, in Corpus Christi, Tex., to Harry and Tillie (Grossman) Sheinberg, Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. They ran a dry goods store that catered mostly to Mexican-Americans.

As a teenager, Mr. Sheinberg worked as an announcer and occasional disc jockey at a local radio station. He graduated from Columbia University in 1955 and enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin for law school.

But he later transferred back to Columbia to earn his law degree after a dispute with Texas administrators over their treatment of black students. It was a demonstration of his concern for discrimination that would lead him to become involved with Human Rights Watch and prompt him to push Hollywood studios to provide same-sex benefits, landing him on the cover of the gay magazine The Advocate in 1991.

“I sat in his office as he made those phone calls, and it was not a quick ‘Yes, yes, yes’ from everyone” at those studios, said Skip Paul, a senior adviser at the investment bank Centerview Partners, who was groomed by Mr. Sheinberg at MCA. “When Sid believed in something or somebody, he didn’t just have your back — he pushed on your back.”

In 1956 Mr. Sheinberg married a Columbia classmate, Lorraine Gary. They settled in Southern California, where she had grown up and would become an actress, starring in “Jaws” and its sequels. He accepted a teaching job at the University of California, Los Angeles in 1958. The next year, he joined the legal department at Revue Productions, a television subsidiary of MCA, which eventually became Universal Television.

As he rose in MCA’s television business, Mr. Sheinberg drew the attention of Mr. Wasserman. Though not similar in style — Mr. Wasserman was smooth and diplomatic, while Mr. Sheinberg had rough edges — the men bonded over their backgrounds: They were both sons of families who had fled Eastern Europe’s anti-Semitism and settled in Middle America. (Mr. Wasserman, who died in 2002, grew up in Ohio.)

“Lew took note of Sid because he was one of the very few people who would stand up to him,” the director and actor Jerry Adler said in “The Last Mogul.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>While Renault has been in the headlines for the arrest of Carlos Ghosn, the former chief executive who is facing charges of financial wrongdoing, the Renault F1 Team has been quietly preparing for the 2019 season.

The signing of Daniel Ricciardo, who was successful at Red Bull, is the first time Renault has had a winning driver in one of their cars since taking back control of the team in 2016. Adding Ricciardo to the driver lineup was a motivating force over the winter, Cyril Abiteboul, the team principal, said.

“When you sign someone like Daniel, you don’t just sign a driver who we know is quick — he’s an excellent race driver, excellent overtaker,” Abiteboul said. “He comes as a proven quantity, but also with what we know of him off track, as a human being, as a team player he’s fantastic.

“From a management perspective, it was extremely easy to get everyone extremely motivated over the winter to do what we have to do on the engine side, to hopefully bridge a gap and on the chassis side to produce a car despite very late changes to the aerodynamic regulation, to the technical regulation. So everyone’s super motivated, everyone is really willing to give to Daniel the best that we can, given where we are today in the team journey.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The N.C.A.A. women’s basketball tournament began on Friday with a romp by a team not used to being a mere No. 2 seed, and a scare for a No. 2 seed that almost yielded the first-ever victory for a No. 15 seed.

Napheesa Collier scored 23 points and Connecticut, which was last lower than a No. 1 seed in 2006, rolled to a 110-61 win against 15th-seeded Towson in Storrs.

The freshman Christyn Williams scored 21 points and Crystal Dangerfield added 20 for The Huskies (32-2), which had five players in double figures and scored more than 100 points for the fourth time this season.

“The difference in this year is that we know, even if we play our best game, we can lose,” UConn Coach Geno Auriemma said. “We just don’t have enough pieces, which is O.K. Because then the goal becomes, let’s see how close we can come to playing a great game and then take our chances, because the other team still has to play great, and there is no guarantee of that.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>There have been at least three occasions in the late 20th century when American presidents tried to influence Israeli elections, according to Aaron David Miller, a Middle East scholar at the Wilson Center who worked on Arab-Israeli negotiations as a State Department official. He cited efforts by President George Bush and then President Bill Clinton, one of which involved Mr. Clinton trying to boost Shimon Peres over Mr. Netanyahu.

“The Trump administration’s re-elect Netanyahu campaign is in full swing,” Mr. Miller said. “Pompeo’s Israel stop — rare for a secretary of state this close to an Israeli election — is designed to show that the U.S. and Israel are in sync on policy, especially Iran.”

On Wednesday morning, before flying to Israel, Mr. Pompeo held a news conference in Kuwait City with the foreign minister of Kuwait. An American reporter asked Mr. Pompeo for the exact position of the United States on the West Bank and Golan Heights: Were they or were they not occupied by Israel?

Mr. Pompeo said only “there’s been no change in U.S. policy” but did not lay out the policy.

On Monday night, a reporter accompanying Mr. Pompeo on the flight to Kuwait asked him whether the State Department had made a deliberate change to language in the human rights report by using “Israeli-controlled” rather than “Israeli-occupied.”

“This was a factual statement about how we observe the situation,” Mr. Pompeo said. “And we think it’s very accurate, and we stand behind it.”

Last year, the State Department’s human rights report stopped using “occupied” in headlines on the West Bank and Gaza, but kept the word in the text.

In Lebanon, on the final stop of his trip, Mr. Pompeo plans to denounce Hezbollah.

He has also been pressuring Iraq to distance itself from neighboring Iran. That has raised tensions with Iraqi leaders and even with Pentagon and C.I.A. officials, who say Mr. Pompeo’s hard-line stand on Iran was jeopardizing ties between the United States and Iraq, where 5,200 American troops are based. Mr. Pompeo had already strained ties with European allies over Iran policy.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Going out to dinner, running to the store, spontaneous road trips, even hosting game nights — all of it suddenly became far more complicated. Our friends quickly discovered that we were no longer free at the drop of a hat. If we were to be involved, our get-togethers had to be thoroughly planned, often a week or more in advance.

We weren’t just missing out on fun nights. We had begun to feel a deep need for advice from other parents, but we hardly knew any. Our first child was born when we were living in Chicago, which might help explain our lack of parent-friends. A report from the National Center for Health Statistics shows that people living in urban areas are waiting longer to have their first child than people in the suburbs or rural areas. At that time, we only knew two other couples with kids.

After we moved to a small town in Southern Illinois, we began making friends with couples who shared our kid-shaped schedules. A lot of these friends ended up being older than the people we used to hang out with.

Amid this group, we still stand out. The unique stresses of millennial parenting are pretty apparent. Like many people our age, my wife and I feel caught in a tight spot in establishing ourselves financially, between paying off student loans and finding decent-paying employment in a career path. These friends, for the most part, are professionally established, own homes and have settled in their communities. Some economists suggest that it’s precisely these kinds of stresses that have caused young adults to delay starting families in the first place.

Still, I wouldn’t trade waking up every morning to their little voices, one babbling incoherently and the other asking for a breakfast, which he does not eat. Being a young parent hasn’t always been easy, but I suspect that having children — no matter when you do — never is.</TEXT>

Things pick up when baby Dumbo arrives in a makeshift birthing bed. Now a digital cutie with gargantuan ears that hang off each side of his head like heavy leather curtains, the newest, littlest circus addition is conspicuously more animal than his childlike antecedent. Like the original, this Dumbo doesn’t speak, which perhaps is why Burton focuses on his unnaturally large, expressive eyes. (He’s an Indian elephant, so his trunk has one searching finger.) Those eyes moisten a lot, including when Holt’s drearily conceptualized and motherless — of course! — children (Nico Parker and Finley Hobbins) comfort Dumbo after his protective mom is sent to elephant jail.

In time, the kids help teach Dumbo to fly, coaxing him with a feather he snuffles into his trunk: He sneezes, and the exhalation sends him up. When he finally achieves genuine liftoff, soaring around the interior of the circus’s one-ring tent, Burton does, too. It’s ticklish fun to watch baby elephants of any kind, including an airborne one. That’s true even if Dumbo’s flights prove increasingly bleak because he’s at the mercy of some very bad people. Humans are secondary attractions in the 1941 movie (its animals are people proxies) but they crowd the remake. Most are just generic placeholders, but a few are strikingly brutal exploiters, none more so than V. A. Vandevere, a subversive invention.

Played by Michael Keaton in full live-wire mode, Vandevere is a stereotypical Richie Rich screen villain with a shadowy lair; dark designs; a wolfish smile; and a silky, possibly fatal femme, Colette (Eva Green, who adds some steel filament to a bauble). Keaton makes the character more memorable than most anyone here; Vandevere seems ready to dangerously pop. What makes him particularly arresting, though, is that he owns a sprawling, impersonal amusement park named Dreamland that is filled with menace and with attractions — Nightmare Island, Wonders of Science, Rocket to the Future and the ominously named Colosseum — that suggest a Disneyland Bizarro World.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Mérida, the capital of the Mexican state of Yucatán, is a magnet for creative souls from around the world — if you want to understand why, just read Peter Haldeman’s article this week and look at the incredible light in the accompanying photographs. He offers a guide to the exhibition spaces, restored historic homes and restaurants where long languid dinners play out over an evening. Peter went to Mérida and stayed part of the time with friends. As one of them tells him, people first come to Mérida to visit the ruins and the cenotes, then, “look at houses the second time, and buy a house the third time.” Watch out, it could happen to you.

We also visit Venice in this week’s issue, in search of the small bars known as bacarò that serve the Italian version of tapas known as cicchetti. Cicchetti are cheap, delectable and truly Venetian, and we have a guide to seven classic bacarò where you can find them.

Our 36 Hours column visits the Belgian city of Ghent — often overshadowed by Bruges, it has its own medieval core, picturesque canals and, yes, moules frites. Seth Sherwood offers suggestions for a long weekend there. Closer to home, Sebastian Modak, our 52 Places Traveler, eats three meals in Houston that capture the city’s diversity, and we drop in on Fairhope, Ala., a town of “natural beauty and eccentric ambition.” To help you plan your travels, we have a month-by-month Frugal Traveler guide to when to get the best travel deals — consider booking your Alaska trip for next month now.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>THE ART OF BIBLE TRANSLATION By Robert Alter. (Princeton, $24.95.) Alter, who just completed the monumental task of translating the entire Hebrew Bible, presents his thoughts on what he learned. In a series of short essays, he delves into the minutiae of word choice, syntax and rhythm that make up the substance of a translator’s work. EDDIE SPAGHETTI By Rutu Modan. (Fantagraphics, $12.99.) Israel’s most classic children’s book, written by the renowned poet Lea Goldberg and illustrated by Aryeh Navon, tells the tale of a mischievous boy and the trouble he gets into with his dog. Modan, an illustrator and comic book artist, offers a loving interpretation rendered in her whimsical, retro style. A DESERT HARVEST By Bruce Berger. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $26.) Berger is a chronicler of desert life in all its forms, from the cactuses to life in the small towns of the Southwest. This collection of his work spans a career of over 30 years, leaving readers with an impressionistic picture of a distinctly American ecology. WHO KILLED MY FATHER By Édouard Louis. (New Directions, $18.95.) The author of “The End of Eddy” returns with a nonfiction take on France’s neglect of its working class, revisiting his hometown and his father, barely 50 and dying: “You belong to the category of humans whom politics has doomed to an early death.” MAX HAVELAAR OR, THE COFFEE AUCTIONS OF THE DUTCH TRADING COMPANY By Multatuli. (New York Review Books, paper, $17.95.) An anti-colonialist novel that caused a stir when it was first published in 1860, this pseudonymously written work tells the story of a Dutch colonial administrator who struggles against the exploitation of the Indonesian peasantry.

“Amazon offers almost every book ever published, but when I scroll through the site I find myself traveling in the same old ruts. Browsing at Books Kinokuniya, a chain with headquarters in Tokyo and stores all over the world, is an altogether different experience. There’s a location a few blocks from The New York Times Building, and I would be lying if I said I haven’t spent some time in its shelves on slow news days. One enjoyable discovery was the addictive mystery writer Keigo Higashino. Another was Sayaka Murata, the author of a spellbinding short novel, CONVENIENCE STORE WOMAN. My most recent trip led me to two books by the great Japanese short story writer Ryunosuke Akutagawa. I have just devoured KAPPA, his satirical novella about a land populated with mythical creatures, and am now in the thrall of RASHOMON AND OTHER STORIES. Akutagawa’s work is polished in style and gritty in subject

      <TEXT>People travel to the world’s farthest reaches to see the northern lights, camping on glaciers in Greenland or flying in helicopters over Iceland in their pursuit.

But according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, an anticipated geomagnetic storm could make the phenomenon visible over the northern United States on Saturday, including parts of New York State.

Many people may want to believe that they can look upward and see a shimmering array of green and violet strewn across the night sky. It happened in the Upper Midwest and in New York in 2017. In 2011, an aurora was seen as far south as Alabama.

Public officials and health experts had given several warnings: Do not allow a student in school if they had not been vaccinated against measles.



Still, during New York City’s largest measles outbreak in a decade, a school in Brooklyn ignored that advice, resulting in one student infecting at least 21 other people with the virus.

The outbreak, at Yeshiva Kehilath Yakov in Williamsburg, is reigniting concerns that too many people in New York’s ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities are unvaccinated, as well as worries that measles would continue to spread after travelers arrived last fall from parts of Israel and Europe, where the virus was spreading.

City officials said they have struggled to increase vaccination rates in certain communities because of popularity of the widely debunked anti-vaccination movement, with parents declining vaccines for their children in fear that they increase the risk of autism.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>And at some point, after you see all this other dancing that you’ve never really seen done in quite this way before, he starts gliding backwards. And now we know that this backward glide is called the moonwalk. I was in my mother’s bedroom watching this, and I could remember just sitting there in just absolute awe. You could feel it as you watched it. This man was changing everything. In terms of historical American events, you know, on the one hand, you have the moon landing. And then you have the moonwalk. And I would argue there’s probably no other artist who is as important to where popular music currently is than Michael Jackson.

The first time I watched it, I watched it in an office. It was basically a conference room at HBO. They showed me the movie. I was alone in a nice little corner conference room with a TV, and you know, it was me and my notepad. And all my baggage. And it was funny, because I watched it by myself, and I realized once I was there and the door was closed and this thing was starting that I didn’t want to be there anymore. I just, I looked around, and I’m like, I don’t want to do this. I don’t want to do it! But, you know, I’m a professional. What does it look like if I open the door and ask if we can stop? Can we stop? But the ride had already left the bay. So I stayed. And I watched the whole thing, all four hours.

Like, a huge part of not just our love of music, but our sense of who we are as a people. I mean, the tragic thing about Michael Jackson is an American tragic thing. It is a story about race. It is a story about growing up poor and becoming extremely rich. It is a story about sexuality and gender and racial transformation in your physical body. I think that he means too much to delete or cancel. I mean, you make one thing go away, but you’re still dealing with all this other stuff. I just feel like he’s so much bigger than what he physically was. And I think the stories these men are telling need to go in the space that we culturally have been waiting to put a story like this in, based on everything we already knew about Michael Jackson.

Well, he can’t change, because he’s dead. The music can’t change, because it’s already been made and we’ve thoroughly absorbed it. I think the thing that has to change is us. We can change. But I also wonder whether or not the thing that we should be taking away from this entire problem with respect to Michael Jackson and Wade Robson and James Safechuck is this concept of justice. There’s no satisfying outcome for this. This is a tragedy. And we have to accept it as a tragedy. And I don’t think the way we accept a tragedy is by covering our ears when you hear a Michael Jackson song. We’re past that now. I think what we have to do is figure out a way to live with a thing that we’ve been living with this entire time. We have to be able to hold space that incorporates the bad stuff with the great stuff. It’s the only way this is going to work, because this is not going to stop happening. And it’s obviously not just famous people, it’s everybody. It’s coaches, it’s priests, it’s politicians. It doesn’t work to just make people go away and not deal with the root problem of this behavior. And I think with Michael Jackson — I think that the reason the “what do we do now?” is so dissatisfying is because there’s nothing to do but listen and move through the world aware that this person did this. And it can’t be undone. These guys don’t get their childhoods back. There’s no jail to put this man in. There’s no place to send him. And the work is on us. And I think part of the reason that people want either an easy answer or don’t want to know anything is because we don’t want to do the work. It’s hard work.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WASHINGTON — Oleg V. Deripaska, a Russian oligarch with close ties to the Kremlin, sued the United States government on Friday, demanding it lift sanctions that he claimed have cost him billions of dollars, made him “radioactive” in international business circles and exposed him to criminal investigation and asset confiscation in Russia.

In a lawsuit filed in United States District Court in Washington, Mr. Deripaska said that the sanctions, leveled in April by the Treasury Department, should be struck down because they deprived him of due process and relied on unproven smears that fell outside the sanctions program.

The lawsuit called Mr. Deripaska “the latest victim of this country’s political infighting and ongoing reaction to Russia’s purported interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections,” and asserted that “the general hysteria surrounding Deripaska prevents him from having a meaningful opportunity to challenge” the sanctions “through the normal channels for doing so.”

The sanctions were imposed in retaliation for “a range of malign activity around the globe” by Russia, including its election interference and its incursions into neighboring Ukraine, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said at the time.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The No. 2 seeds are Michigan State (28-6), Tennessee (29-5), Kentucky (27-6) and Michigan (28-6). The first of these edged the last of these in the Big Ten conference final minutes before the bracket was released. Yet it was the defeated Wolverines who received the privilege of placement in the West alongside Gonzaga, while the Spartans — who won all three games against their in-state rival this season — landed in Duke’s dreaded quadrant.

The Blue Devils finished the regular season on a 3-3 skid without Williamson, who sprained his knee when his shoe ripped open during a game on Feb. 20. But Williamson, the prospective No. 1 overall pick in the N.B.A. draft, returned last week, and Duke proceeded to stomp through the A.C.C. tournament. Williamson set the Duke scoring record for that event, with 81 points.

The selection committee effectively ignored the non-Williamson .500 squad and instead considered the team that has won every game except for a 2-point loss to Gonzaga and an overtime loss to Syracuse (20-13). It is Duke’s first No. 1 seed since 2015, which is also the last year it won the tournament.

“They earned their right to be there,” said the selection committee chairman, Bernard Muir, who is Stanford’s athletic director, when he appeared on CBS’s selection show to discuss the bracket.

The most challenging of the four regions appeared to be the South, topped by Virginia. If the Cavaliers get past 16-seeded Gardner-Webb (23-11) on Friday — a game they surely will not take for granted after last year — they could face a No. 8-seeded Mississippi (20-12) that has four wins over tournament teams. Then potential round of 16 opponents include Wisconsin (23-10), underseeded at No. 5, or fourth-seeded Kansas State (25-8), which came close to the Final Four last year.</TEXT>

• Beto O’Rourke, whose near-miss Senate run last year propelled him to Democratic stardom, joined the race for president this morning. In the crowded and competitive primary field, his entrance adds to the mix a relentless campaigner with a small-dollar fund-raising army. Here’s where he stands on the issues.
• Paul Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, will serve seven and a half years in prison, after a federal judge nearly doubled his sentence, denouncing him as a man who “spent a significant portion of his career gaming the system.” It’s still far less than he could’ve served.
• Mr. Manafort has also been charged in New York with mortgage fraud and more than a dozen other state felonies, in an effort by the Manhattan district attorney to ensure he will still face prison time if Mr. Trump pardons him for his federal crimes.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>At the same time, there are real safety concerns to address before we can implement end-to-end encryption across all of our messaging services. Encryption is a powerful tool for privacy, but that includes the privacy of people doing bad things. When billions of people use a service to connect, some of them are going to misuse it for truly terrible things like child exploitation, terrorism, and extortion. We have a responsibility to work with law enforcement and to help prevent these wherever we can. We are working to improve our ability to identify and stop bad actors across our apps by detecting patterns of activity or through other means, even when we can’t see the content of the messages, and we will continue to invest in this work. But we face an inherent tradeoff because we will never find all of the potential harm we do today when our security systems can see the messages themselves.

Finding the right ways to protect both privacy and safety is something societies have historically grappled with. There are still many open questions here and we’ll consult with safety experts, law enforcement and governments on the best ways to implement safety measures. We’ll also need to work together with other platforms to make sure that as an industry we get this right. The more we can create a common approach, the better.

On balance, I believe working towards implementing end-to-end encryption for all private communications is the right thing to do. Messages and calls are some of the most sensitive private conversations people have, and in a world of increasing cyber security threats and heavy-handed government intervention in many countries, people want us to take the extra step to secure their most private data. That seems right to me, as long as we take the time to build the appropriate safety systems that stop bad actors as much as we possibly can within the limits of an encrypted service. We’ve started working on these safety systems building on the work we’ve done in WhatsApp, and we’ll discuss them with experts through 2019 and beyond before fully implementing end-to-end encryption. As we learn more from those experts, we’ll finalize how to roll out these systems.

We increasingly believe it’s important to keep information around for shorter periods of time. People want to know that what they share won’t come back to hurt them later, and reducing the length of time their information is stored and accessible will help.

One challenge in building social tools is the “permanence problem”. As we build up large collections of messages and photos over time, they can become a liability as well as an asset. For example, many people who have been on Facebook for a long time have photos from when they were younger that could be embarrassing. But people also really love keeping a record of their lives. And if all posts on Facebook and Instagram disappeared, people would lose access to a lot of valuable knowledge and experiences others have shared.

I believe there’s an opportunity to set a new standard for private communication platforms — where content automatically expires or is archived over time. Stories already expire after 24 hours unless you archive them, and that gives people the comfort to share more naturally. This philosophy could be extended to all private content.

      <TEXT>Michel Bacos, the valiant French pilot who was forced by terrorists to fly his jetliner to Entebbe, Uganda, in 1976, but refused to abandon Jewish passengers before an audacious rescue by Israeli commandos, died on Tuesday in Nice, France. He was 94.

His death was announced by Christian Estrosi, the mayor of Nice, where Mr. Bacos lived.

“Michel bravely refused to surrender to anti-Semitism and barbarism and brought honor to France,” Mayor Estrosi said. “Michel was a hero.”

Celebrated in films and books, the swashbuckling rescue by Israelis disguised as Ugandan soldiers culminated a harrowing week in which hijackers from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and Germany’s Baader-Meinhof Gang seized control of Air France Flight 139 less than eight minutes after it lifted off from Athens on June 27, 1976. The plane had stopped there on its way from Tel Aviv to Paris.

The plane, carrying more than 240 passengers and a crew of 12, was diverted to Libya to refuel, then directed to fly more than 3,500 miles to Entebbe, where it landed with only 20 minutes of fuel remaining.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Some artists, even acclaimed ones, use a residency with a major orchestra to perform the works they are known for. Bolder artists seize these coveted opportunities to take chances and work closely with individual musicians in the orchestra, as the superb German baritone Matthias Goerne has done this season with the New York Philharmonic.

Last Sunday Mr. Goerne took his artist-in-residence series to the 92nd Street Y, where he explored new dimensions in familiar Schubert songs by performing them in unusual arrangements for voice and strings, joined by members of the orchestra. Schubert’s gravely beautiful “Death and the Maiden” sounded Mahlerian and starkly ominous, with Mr. Goerne, his voice dark and expressive, backed by a string quartet and bass instead of a piano.

The first half of this program involved nearly an hour of concentrated singing for the tireless Mr. Goerne, including an intense rendition of Hanns Eisler’s rightly named “Ernste Gesänge” (“Serious Songs”), an autumnal 1962 cycle. And in several songs by Schubert, Schumann and Brahms, Mr. Goerne’s exemplary young accompanist was, no less, Daniil Trifonov, who played beautifully.

For the last program of his residency, on Thursday at David Geffen Hall, Mr. Goerne sang a work that involved a different kind of risk: John Adams’s “The Wound-Dresser,” with Jaap van Zweden leading the Philharmonic. This poignant 1988 piece for baritone and orchestra sets passages from a poem by Walt Whitman about his experience nursing wounded soldiers during the Civil War in makeshift hospitals on the outskirts of Washington, D.C.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>From the president’s checks to a resolution against hate, it’s been a busy week in American politics. Here are some of the biggest stories you might have missed (and some links if you’d like to read further).

More developments in the Trump investigations.

On a busy day at the White House in October of 2017, President Trump took the time to sign a $35,000 check to Michael D. Cohen, his fixer, who had made hush payments to keep sexual misconduct allegations against Mr. Trump from being exposed. Six such checks were provided to The Times, showing that the president was managing affairs of state while, allegedly, paying to keep his personal secrets out of the public eye.

Mr. Cohen gave documents to the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday that he said backed up his claim that Mr. Trump’s lawyers helped to shape false testimony he delivered to Congress in 2017.

The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee sent requests for information to 81 agencies, individuals and entities tied to Mr. Trump on Monday, opening a broad inquiry into possible obstruction, corruption and abuse of power. Mr. Trump signaled that he did not intend to cooperate with the requests, calling the investigation a “disgrace to our country.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>MADRID — As Spain grapples with a turbulent political crisis, one of Europe’s last Socialist governments may soon fall amid the rise of a new nationalism in the country. But whatever the outcome, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez is leaving behind a signature legacy: a record increase in the minimum wage.

The 22 percent rise that took effect in January, to 1,050 euros (about $1,200) a month, is the largest in Spain in 40 years. Yet the move has ignited a debate over whether requiring employers to pay more of a living wage is a social watershed, or a risky attempt at economic engineering.

Mr. Sanchez insists that the plan will underpin growth by putting more money into the pockets of low-paid workers, which will flow back to the economy through increased spending. Critics, including Spain’s own central bank, have warned that it will kill tens of thousands of jobs by increasing business costs.

It’s a debate playing out around the world, as politicians and officials try to address issues of inequality plaguing their economies.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE: Essays, Criticism, and Commentary, by Lorrie Moore. (Vintage, $17.) Moore is perhaps better known as a novelist and short story writer than a critic, but readers of her fiction will recognize her engaging and approachable voice. Her first nonfiction collection brings together pieces touching on everything from Marilyn Monroe to the O. J. Simpson trial, along with book reviews and political pieces.

THE GUNNERS, by Rebecca Kauffman. (Counterpoint, $16.95.) A group of childhood friends reunites for a funeral, and tries to imagine what drove their classmate to kill herself. Our reviewer, Xhenet Aliu, praised the novel, writing, “There’s so much generosity and spirit and humor shared by whatever characters are on the page at any given time that I was always happy to accompany them.”

THE PLANT MESSIAH: Adventures in Search of the World’s Rarest Species, by Carlos Magdalena. (Anchor, $16.) Magdalena, a senior botanical horticulturist at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, takes readers from the Amazon to the Australian outback on his quest to preserve some of the most vulnerable plants on the globe. Back at his lab, he designs ways to save these species, encouraging them to thrive and breed.

NO ECHO: A Hanne Wilhelmsen Novel, by Anne Holt and Berit Reiss-Andersen. Translated by Anne Bruce. (Scribner, $17.) When the body of a celebrity chef in Oslo is discovered on the steps of the police headquarters, the department scrambles to investigate the killing. Hanne, the heroine of these popular Norwegian crime novels, joins the case after six months in mourning for her partner. As she looks into the murder, it becomes clear that for all his fame, the chef was a mystery, even to those closest to him.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I never communicate over social with people I’m writing about. I give them my card at the end of our first meeting and put my cell onto it, and if they have something they forgot to tell me or are worried about, they can contact me.

It has led to a lot of further interactions that have really made the story. Also, it’s helpful to ask Bradley Cooper over text what kind of hat he was wearing rather than go through other people, particularly during film promotion time. I’m not so organized all the time, and sometimes I don’t think to ask pertinent questions until I read the transcript or realize I want to describe something I saw that I didn’t ask about in the room.

When people you write about share a story or not share what you’ve written on social media, what do you generally consider that to mean?

God, that’s a hard one. I think it’s really hard to be written about. You’re essentially vulnerable to a stranger. I feel very bad for everyone I write about. I tell them before publication: “You can read this if you want, but it’s not really for you. It’s about you, but it’s not for you.”

When someone asks if it’s a good or a bad story, I always say, “It’s not good or bad, it’s a third thing.” Some people want to stay in touch. Some people never want to see me again. There are very few people who have hated their story.

But that’s not the same as the person being comfortable with it. If I do a good job and tell the intimate story that I, as a reader, want to read, then probably that person I wrote about never wants to be in a room with me again.

This is a long way of saying: I don’t take it personally. I don’t even notice most of the time when it happens, because I unfollow people pretty quickly because the experience was also very intense for me, and it’s sad to me that I have these short-lived intensive relationships and then they’re over. Like, when “Shakespeare in Love” used to come on HBO, I’d watch it. Now I have a hard time watching it. When I see Gwyneth, I have every emotion I had when I was reporting and writing and closing and publishing that story, which is the opposite of escapism.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Mr. Mueller is to be commended for his work as the special counsel who has conducted a historic investigation into Russian meddling in our election, and into who may or may not have colluded and conspired with the Russians during the 2016 campaign.

Well done, Mr. Mueller. You have once again served your country with honor and dignity.

Re “My Hope for the Mueller Report,” by James Comey (Op-Ed, March 22):

It is the substance of the Mueller report that will be all-important, not the mere process. In other words, if Donald Trump or others acting with even his tacit consent conspired with the Russian government to corrupt our election process, or if this president has acted to obstruct the process in getting to the truth, and the report fails to pin down such misdeeds, justice will not have been done. If we are merely left to continue to wonder, the nation will remain as deeply divided as it now appears to be.

Of course, other issues concerning this president remain no matter what the Mueller report concludes from its underlying investigation. The conflicts of interest that engulf this presidency and its seemingly unending divisive nature are issues that remain for Congress and the rest of us. The Trump presidency is like a classroom hypothetical of what can go wrong with our government and the speed with which it can happen.

One thing Mr. Trump was right about: If Jeff Sessions had not recused himself in his role as attorney general from investigating the 2016 election, we might never have had a special counsel , and a complicit Republican Congress would have buried the entire matter. That is an “if” that should make us feel nervous about our system of justice.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Although such aspirations were firmly quashed during the opening years of colonial rule, the March 1 demonstrations of 1919, and particularly the calamities of their bloody suppression, compelled the Japanese government to change its approach. That fall, the new colonial administration declared a liberalized policy of “cultural rule” that stressed the “harmony of Japan and Korea.”

This did not mean Koreans would gain independence, or even that the mechanisms of autocratic foreign occupation would weaken. But it did mark the peak formative period of modern Korean nationhood. Koreans could now participate much more freely in publishing, religion and business, and they formed and joined organizations dedicated to all kinds of cultural, intellectual and economic endeavors. This produced the first canon of great modern literary works, fostered competing articulations of national identity and even prompted the standardization of written Korean.

But these hopeful developments came to a screeching halt when Japan, during the Pacific War of 1937-1945, imposed a total mobilization, which included abuses such as forced labor, sexual slavery and an attempt to obliterate a distinctive Korean identity. Under intense strain, even revered figures like Yi and Choe, who had eloquently given voice to their countrymen’s longing for independence, now called for Koreans to become “imperial subjects” of the Japanese emperor and sacrifice their lives for Japan’s wars.

So did the March 1 movement fail? While it prompted a flowering of national and nationalist culture, it did not result in Korea’s independence, its primary goal. And the moderation of colonial rule eventually gave way to brutal repression of Korean identity.

The movement’s significance extends to another major outcome of March 1 as well. A month after the protests broke out, resistance groups established, in Shanghai, the Korean Provisional Government of the newly declared Republic of Korea. These groups included budding Communists, armed fighters from Siberia and Manchuria, expatriates from the United States and activists from within the peninsula. On April 10, 1919, they issued a founding proclamation and draft constitution, which pointed to the March 1 demonstrations and, like the February declaration, promised that the new state would join the League of Nations.

This unity proved short-lived. The independence movement split into two opposing ideological camps, a division that eventually became institutionalized into the separate states that we know today as North and South Korea. Communist leaders spread across Asia and later fought the Japanese in the wilderness of Manchuria, while their right-wing counterparts aligned with the Chinese nationalists. Another batch of independence activists worked out of the United States, although they too branched into separate groups based in Hawaii and California and on the East Coast.

An umbrella organization that linked the various non-Communist independence efforts after 1919 was the Korean National Association, headquartered in Los Angeles. Over 16,000 K.N.A. documents, which were discovered in 2002 and have since been digitized by the Korean Heritage Library of the University of Southern California, reveal an extensive, global network of organizations, funds and activists, including esteemed figures like Ahn Chang-Ho, Henry Chung, Philip Jaisohn, Hyun Soon, Syngman Rhee — later the first president of South Korea — and Kim Kyu-sik, a self-appointed delegate to the Versailles Peace Conference and the K.P.G.’s first foreign minister.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>During visits to the state fair with my family, I discovered my penchant for thrill-seeking in carnival attractions like the Scrambler and the Tilt-a-Whirl. But the fair was missing the majesty of larger-than-life roller coasters. We seemingly had to travel to another country for those: Texas. Each summer, we would drive three hours to Fort Worth to see my cousins and go to Six Flags Over Texas together.

On the highway as we approached the park, one of the most beautiful, most terrifying sights came into view: a steel beast called the Shock Wave. It had not one, but two loops, back to back! I avoided it at all costs. I feared I’d faint after the first loop, leaving my limp, unconscious body gliding through the second. And yet, I was obsessed with it.

Another fearful obsession was the Runaway Mine Train, a coaster with a track that seemed endless and disappeared through the woods. It was even more frightening than the Shock Wave because I couldn’t see the dastardly places it might be going. There were rumors it went underwater. Underwater! It sounded like something a maniac would dream up. But one time, waiting outside the ride, one of my sisters put the pressure on me to ride it. She convinced me, assured me, that it didn’t, couldn’t possibly, go underwater. I finally relented. Lo and behold, the very last part of the ride went through a makeshift saloon and plunged down into an underwater tunnel. I’d never known such deception.

But I’d also never known such excitement. It was a true rush, the moment that solidified my coaster love. I became braver and more willing to give bigger rides a try. I met the Shock Wave head-on, and made it through both loops with my consciousness intact. Theme parks became the place where I, and my imagination, could run wild.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Not that Aipac supporters are afraid to write checks — a nationwide network of affiliated political action committees and donors is a key component of its strategy. Still, the total amount of pro-Israel donations to members of Congress came to $10.6 million in 2018, only the 34th highest among Washington interest groups, behind the entertainment industry ($15.6 million), lawyers ($80.6 million) and retirees ($110 million).

The idea that Aipac is tied at the hip to the Republican Party and Israel’s far right is also an exaggeration. Aipac is more comfortable, and was always more effective, as a bipartisan operation, positioned near the center of Jewish-American politics. Today, it supports the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, a view that is widely held by American Jews, but opposed by the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s current coalition.

In 2007, Sheldon Adelson, a major donor, broke with Aipac over its conciliatory positions and established a rival group to its right called the Israeli American Council. And to its left is the liberal-Zionist group J Street.

Mr. Netanyahu will address this year’s conference, but so will Benny Gantz, a former general and Mr. Netanyahu’s opponent in next month’s elections. It’s rare to have an Israeli opposition leader speak at Aipac on the eve of an election. Simply by scheduling Mr. Gantz, Aipac is signaling its own Netanyahu fatigue.

Does Aipac have failings? Sure. They are the same as those that beset any older, established organization: bureaucratic rigidity and an inability to adapt quickly to new challenges. In Aipac’s case, it was spoiled for years by the absence of any serious opposition.

But today Aipac is struggling to adjust. Political and generational divisions are jeopardizing the organization’s old-school, bipartisan approach. Aipac used to be able to sidestep issues like settlements and the occupation, but now, with the Israeli right threatening annexation of the West Bank, the occupation has become the moral rallying point of the Jewish left, and Aipac appears paralyzed.

The left and the right are again using anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism as wedge issues to break up traditional alliances. Anti-Zionist groups are working hard to delegitimize the Jewish state, not only on Capitol Hill, but also on college campuses and on the nation’s editorial pages.</TEXT>

      <TITLE>Preet Bharara’s Lessons on Crime and Punishment - The New York Times</TITLE>

      <TEXT>Is all of this book filled with Polonius gunk? No. Most chapters delight or provoke in some way, if you mentally redact the fortune-cookie sentences (of which there are mercifully fewer in the second half). Bharara divides “Doing Justice” into four parts — Inquiry, Accusation, Judgment and Punishment — thereby following the rhythms of a criminal case, and almost every chapter returns, either directly or via roundabout, to Bharara’s basic contention, pithily summarized on Page 58: “In the end, the law doesn’t do justice. People do.” (This is a popular theme of his podcast, too: that democracy depends on good-faith actors to function properly.) His book is ultimately about ordinary fallibility, and how those responsible for the dispensation of justice are regular humans, prone to act as humans do. It is filled with sobering stories about error and — in the more beautiful, memorable cases — ingenuity, determination, redemption.

[ This book was one of our most anticipated titles of March. See the full list here. ]

There’s a chapter about the difficulty of overcoming confirmation bias. There’s a chapter about the paradox of the cooperating witness, who’s high in information and low in character — “the linchpin of your case is also your Achilles’ heel.” There are chapters about the futility of torture, the difficulty of determining fair sentences and the importance of walking away from a case, even when there are sunk costs.

The chapter about the idiosyncrasies and hidden frailties of judges is particularly eye-opening. (A limitation I’d never considered: Judges don’t get to watch fellow judges in action. “Their observational experience is largely stopped in time at the moment of being sworn in.”) In fact, the entire Judgment section, about the courtroom phase of the judicial process, may be the book’s most captivating, for the very reasons Bharara finds an old-fashioned trial so captivating: It’s cinema-ready. (Watch for the case of the battered prostitute seeking her stolen cash. Not since John Gutfreund played a $1 million round of Liar’s Poker has the serial number on a slip of American currency been so consequential.)

Bharara, who enjoyed a high profile and (mostly) favorable press attention during his tenure from 2009 to 2017, does not show a lot of leg in this book, nor does he settle many scores. Yes, he tweaks The Wall Street Journal for highlighting the fact that he went after Raj Rajaratnam, a fellow immigrant from the same region of the world. “My goodness, there’s a South Asian defendant, and there’s a South Asian prosecutor!” he writes. “You know where this happens every day? India.” But he says virtually nothing about SAC Capital’s Steven A. Cohen, whose wolfish appetite for insider information Bharara’s office could never quite prove, and his words about Trump, the man who fired him, are few.

And why is this, exactly? Considering Bharara’s emphasis on old-fashioned values — duty, discretion, decency — and their application to the law, it seems strange that he wouldn’t offer some words about what happened to the United States on Nov. 8, 2016, when the worst-faith actor imaginable was suddenly elected president. Did the country have a heart attack? Or is it merely undergoing a stress test?

I wish he’d said. What Bharara does offer, however, is an inspired and slightly perverse idea about how to salvage public discourse in 2019: We should take our cues from American criminal trials, in which both parties are obliged to consider flaws in their own arguments and understand the mind-set of the other side. Assertions must be evidence-based; research must be rigorous; decorum is paramount. “You can’t call your adversary a ‘low-I.Q. person,’” he notes. “You can’t argue the prosecution is political; and you can’t make sweeping biased statements.”

The first thing we do, let’s revive all the lawyers. Bharara, as usual, makes a very strong case.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Knife crime is rising for the fourth straight year in Britain — there were 43,000 such offenses in the year ending Sept. 30, 2018 — though over all it has declined markedly since the mid-1990s. Two recent fatal stabbings of 17-year-olds have refocused national attention on the problem and created a political crisis for Prime Minister Theresa May.

The opposition Labour Party is blaming austerity for the rise in knife crime, and Mrs. May’s own home secretary, Sajid Javid, has clashed with her, demanding emergency increases in police funding.

Analysis: There are more than 20,000 fewer police officers today than in 2010, and many now spend hours doing the work once done by mental health agencies that have been cut back or eliminated. But analysts largely agree that the data does not connect rising crime to diminished police presence. Instead, they point to austerity cuts to social services, like youth centers and interventions for children who are expelled from school .</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Good Tuesday morning. Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today.
• For nearly two decades, President Trump relied on Deutsche Bank to lend to him when others wouldn’t. The bank, eager to expand in the United States, lent him $2 billion over the years — and once he was elected president, employees were told not to utter his name. Here’s what The Times found in an investigation, and here are four takeaways from our reporting.
• Expanding access to insurance animated the Democrats’ 2018 congressional campaigns. But as House Democrats sit down to draft their vision of health care policy, lawmakers find themselves badly divided on an issue that helped deliver their majority.
• Beto O’Rourke raised more than $6 million online in the first 24 hours after announcing his presidential campaign last week, outpacing his rivals for the Democratic nomination and making an emphatic statement about his grass-roots financial strength.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Chuck Todd led a wall-to-wall discussion on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” It included commentary on whether the Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke had jumped the gun at a campaign stop on Friday when he said: “This is an unprecedented attack on this country and on our democracy, and we are owed the facts. And if we do not receive them, 243 years in, there’s nothing that guarantees us a 244th.”

On “Fox News Sunday,” the program hosted by Chris Wallace, Representative Doug Collins, Republican of Georgia, said the president had been proved right in repeatedly saying “no collusion.” On the same show, Mr. Nadler called for the release of the entire report and its underlying materials.

Also in the morning hours, on CNN’s “Reliable Sources,” the host Brian Stelter asked of whether reporters and talking heads had inflated expectations.

He seemed to be reacting to an analytical article posted online on Saturday by the Rolling Stone journalist Matt Taibbi, who wrote that the lack of new charges emerging from the report “is a deathblow for the reputation of the American news media.” Mr. Taibbi cited instances of overreaching by some reporters and pundits to make his case.

Mr. Stelter pushed back against that view. “Don’t be fooled by the partisans who cherry-pick the worst mistakes of individual journalists or the craziest ideas from commentators and claim that’s the entire media,” he said.

The problem, Mr. Stelter said, lay in the competing interests of “agenda-driven columnists” and “journalists who report the news.” He put Joy-Ann Reid, of MSNBC, and Jesse Watters, of Fox News, in the agenda-driven camp. Then he rolled a clip of Ms. Reid suggesting that Mr. Barr may have an interest in covering up the facts; and another of Mr. Watters characterizing the Mueller report as “a knockout blow to the Democrats and the press who say, ‘Collusion, collusion, collusion.’”

The Nixon-era reporting led by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein of The Washington Post seemed newly exceptional, now that Mr. Mueller’s work was done. Mr. Bernstein, a CNN contributor who was a guest on Mr. Stelter’s show, praised recent coverage of President Trump and the allegations that have surrounded him. He singled out the journalism of The Wall Street Journal — owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation — as a sign that democracy was working.

Noting its assiduously reported articles on Mr. Trump, Mr. Bernstein said, “It ought to be stressed that the same owner of Fox News published these stories in his paper.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Alexander Wilson lived an improbable, deceitful, destructive but undeniably intriguing life. An author of popular spy novels and a British secret agent himself in World War II, he married four women from the 1920s through the ’50s without bothering to divorce any of them. He managed to keep his four families mostly secret from each other during his lifetime, and his children (and many grandchildren) only got to know one another more than 40 years after he died.

Sounds like a movie. And it is, or in any case a three-part BBC mini-series, which begins Sunday on PBS’s “Masterpiece.” But Alexander Wilson, better known as Alec, isn’t the main character in the show, which is called “Mrs. Wilson” and takes place mostly after his death in 1963.

That’s what happens when you devote your life to secrecy and, despite publishing 27 books, never tell your own story. But mainly that’s what happens when one of your curious grandchildren turns out to be a famous actress. Ruth Wilson of “Luther” and “The Affair” is the granddaughter of Alec’s third wife, Alison, and she plays her victimized, mystified grandmother in “Mrs. Wilson,” of which she’s also an executive producer.

So rather than the historical adventure or romance it might have been in an earlier era, “Mrs. Wilson” is an interrogation of history, a feminist critique of mid-20th-century British society, a mystery and, least satisfyingly, a character study. The strangeness of the story, and Ruth Wilson’s characteristic intensity, pull us along. But Alison and Alec, and their motivations, never seem to come completely into focus. The series feels caught between fiction and real life, as if the writer (Anna Symon) and the director (Richard Laxton) were unwilling to fully dramatize a history that’s still murky, partly hidden in the files of the British Foreign Office.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“The ideas expressed in this manifesto are pretty widely shared beyond the really fanatic fringe — in not just the far-right but also the mainstream,” said Tore Bjørgo, director of the Center for Research on Extremism at the University of Oslo. “But there are very few” — outside the extreme fringes of the extreme-right — “who would take it one step further and try to start a race war.”

The killer’s ability to livestream the attack via his own social media channels — which led to the dissemination of the video and manifesto across YouTube, Facebook and several mainstream media outlets — also highlights how the far-right has harnessed the reach of major media and technology companies, even as it continues to spread its message through the dark corners of obscure internet sites.

By broadcasting his atrocity himself, the killer was able to both circumvent the traditional gatekeepers of news coverage, while also encouraging those same gatekeepers to subsequently regurgitate some of his footage and even unwittingly amplify his ideas to millions more potential imitators than he might otherwise have reached.

“It’s clearly made for media coverage,” Dr. Bjørgo said.

And by writing most of the manifesto in a question-and-answer format, its author had clearly — and correctly — expected it to be picked up and distributed by mainstream media networks, amplifying his ideas further than ever.

“One of the sickest and most upsetting parts of this for me is that the killings, the actual terrorist attacks, are forms of propaganda for the statements,” said Mr. Feldman of the Center for Analysis of the Radical Right. “They draw attentions to their statements through their actions.”

That leaves media organizations in an ethical bind, Mr. Feldman said.

“The coverage will be wall-to-wall today,” he said, “and tomorrow it will set someone else off.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>But their resolve was tested on Saturday. Gonzaga, with its ball screens, took advantage of switches to get the ball to its two N.B.A.-bound big men: Brandon Clarke and Rui Hachimura. And the Zags successfully pushed the pace, surging to a 37-35 lead at halftime.

In the second half, Texas Tech came out in a zone for a few possessions, then rarely switched and resisted the temptation to run with the Zags, controlling the pace to its liking. Then, with the score tied at 58-58, the Red Raiders defense clamped down — holding the Zags without a basket for nearly four minutes.

Meanwhile, Mooney snaked into the paint for a basket that put Texas Tech ahead, 60-58, and Moretti sank a 3-pointer to extend the advantage to 63-58. But Clarke narrowed the gap to 63-60 with two free throws, bringing the Zags’ sizable crowd into the game.

As Culver dribbled the shot clock down at the top of the arc, he glanced to his right and gave a knowing look to Moretti. With the defenders beginning to pinch Culver as the shot clock ran down, he flicked a pass to Moretti, who never hesitated, sinking another 3-pointer to put the Red Raiders ahead, 66-60, with 1:50 to play.

Gonzaga never got the ball back with a chance to get even.

“I thought he was going to pass me and I was ready for it. That’s the chemistry between us,” said Moretti, who watched Villanova’s buzzer-beating championship in 2016 late at night on his iPad at his home in Bologna, Italy. “He knows when I want the ball, and I know when he’s going to pass it to me.”

The Zags, who were the nation’s most efficient offensive team, made only 12 of 33 in the second half, and they turned the ball over 16 times for the game.

“They are really good at reaching, poking and digging things out there,” Gonzaga Coach Mark Few said of the Texas Tech defense. “This is the best team I’ve ever had for taking care of the ball. So it’s real. That defense is real.”

So, too, are the Red Raiders, who will not only continue looking for secrets in the dirt, but in Minneapolis, too.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Olson writes with verve and a historian’s authority. Fourcade, she tells us, was beautiful and liked men, but she was obsessed with defeating the despised Boches. A master of disguises, she frequently changed her hair color, and sometimes used distorting dentures and other theatrical tricks.

Her personal life was — even by French standards — complicated. Fourcade was married, with two young children she didn’t see for years at a time. Her estranged husband is barely mentioned. Before long, however, she fell in love with a French Air Force pilot, Leon Faye, who joined her network as her deputy. Even after she became pregnant with Faye’s child, she continued to take jaw-dropping risks. (Fourcade’s treatment of her children struck me as shockingly cold.)

Olson’s narrative might have been tighter had it focused on fewer and more fleshed-out characters. In a long list of dramatis personae worthy of a Russian novel, one of the more memorable is Fourcade’s agent Jeannie Rousseau. A 20-year-old recent graduate of the prestigious École Libre des Sciences Politiques, Rousseau, like her boss, benefited from men underestimating her. When the Germans set up their Brittany headquarters, Rousseau, who spoke fluent German, applied for a job as a translator. Remarkably careless around this pretty young woman, the Wehrmacht officers peppered their conversations with two strange words: “Peenemünde” and “raketten.” In answer to Jeannie’s seemingly innocent query, an officer showed her a drawing of a rocket and a testing station, on an island off the Baltic coast, Peenemünde. Rousseau’s report on this exchange was an astonishing piece of intelligence. It revealed to the Allies the existence of a new superweapon, the V2 rocket.

In late 1942, 200,000 Wehrmacht troops marched unopposed into the former Vichy-governed “free zone.” Now, with the Gestapo in full charge, Fourcade was often mortally afraid. Reluctantly, she accepted evacuation to London, where she found a different but still vicious war between two titanic exiled French leaders: Charles de Gaulle and Henri Giraud. Fourcade refused to be drawn into this internecine battle and made herself suspect in the eyes of many French exiles by working too closely with the British.

Collaborating with British intelligence confronted Fourcade with a familiar challenge: sexism. When the head of MI6, Cmdr. Claude Dansey, first met Fourcade, he behaved with exaggerated gallantry, presenting her with a bouquet and remarking, “So this is the terrible woman who has had us all scared!” Though anxious to return to her agents in France, Fourcade was told, essentially, not to worry her pretty little head. “You’ve gone on long past the safety limits,” the Englishman admonished her. “According to the law of averages, an underground leader can’t last more than six months. You’ve lasted over two and a half years. It’s sheer witchcraft.” As Olson relates, behind her back he referred to her as “Cohen’s bitch” — a reference to Fourcade’s close friend Cmdr. Kenneth Cohen, the MI6 official in charge of French intelligence during the war. Fourcade eventually returned to France and to her agents in the field.

Awaiting capture by the Gestapo, expecting torture and execution, Fourcade requested permission from a priest to take the cyanide pills she carried — suicide being a mortal sin in her Catholic faith. She shouldn’t have any scruples about this, the priest assured her. It would not be suicide, but instead a means of resisting the enemy. But, as always, she survived, living to the age of 79, dying in 1989.

Will the brutal Nazi occupation of Europe ever stop churning up new material? Probably not. Nor should we ever cease our attempt to fathom two unfathomable questions regarding the 20th century: Just how did Hitler nearly fulfill his murderous vision, and why did so few resist his monstrous plans? Marie-Madeleine Fourcade certainly did, and with this gripping tale Lynne Olson pays her what history has so far denied her. France, slow to confront the stain of Vichy, would do well to finally honor a fighter most of us would want in our foxhole.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Cupid can be a real jerk. Myth gifts him two sets of arrows, golden ones that spark desire, leaden ones that infuse disgust. Sometimes the twerp looses both at once.

How else to explain why Layla (Kavi Ladnier), a professor of contemporary literature, ends up tangled in the sheets with Imran (Sendhil Ramamurthy), a prizewinning novelist whose books she finds “inimical to humanity”? That “inimical to humanity” bit is what she tells him just before she smashes her lips into his. So much for foreplay.

Smart, sexy and not entirely satisfying, Rehana Lew Mirza’s “Hate____,” a production of WP Theater and Colt Coeur, is a political drama gartered and stockinged as a relationship comedy. (If the full title is unpublishable, it’s eminently guessable.) Just beneath the couple’s pheromone-spiked banter lurks a feeling discussion about representation and identity.

Layla, a practicing Muslim, attacks Imran’s best-sellers because she believes they rely on ugly assumptions about Islam and feed white Americans’ fears. They have titles like “The Dishonored,” “The Savage” or “Sacrilege.” (Does this nod to Ayad Akhtar’s “Disgraced,” a play some saw as reinforcing anti-Muslim stereotypes?) “Are you a terrorist?” Layla asks him when she corners him at a book party in his luxury apartment. All six of his books feature male Muslim terrorists, so she figures the odds are pretty good.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>MOSCOW — The Russian state statistics service has halted its monthly reports on the population’s real income, or income adjusted for inflation, after years of declining numbers suggested a fall in Russian’s standard of living.

Economists were already keeping a wary eye on the service, known as Rosstat, after the appointment of a new director in December, just days after President Vladimir V. Putin criticized what he called the poor quality of state statistics.

A flurry of new, optimistic economic data followed. The new director, Pavel Malkov, revised figures for the gross domestic product in past years to show, for example, that 2016 was not actually a recession year in Russia, but that it showed modest growth.

Last month, the agency released its estimate for 2018 growth showing the best economic results in six years: an expansion of 2.3 percent, well above the consensus of independent analysts of 1.7 percent. Even economists at Russian state banks were skeptical. The service attributed much of the unexpected growth to a fortuitous burst of construction in December.</TEXT>

PENN YAN, N.Y. — For a generation of Mennonite women, Elizabeth Catlin was integral to the most joyous occasions of their lives: the births of their children.

Ms. Catlin was a second mother, they said, a birthing attendant who helped them with prenatal care and then caught their babies during hundreds of natural childbirth deliveries at their homes.

So it was incomprehensible to them that on a recent winter day they were in a courtroom to support Ms. Catlin, who in December had been arrested and charged with four felonies for practicing midwifery in a county about an hour southeast of Rochester.

It w as Ms. Catlin’s second arrest: She had been charged the month before in a neighboring county , where the State Police were investigating her possible role in a newborn’s death.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Benn Steil, the author of “The Marshall Plan: Dawn of the Cold War,” has been named the winner of the New-York Historical Society’s Barbara and David Zalaznick Book Prize, awarded each year to the best work in the field of American history or biography.

The 600-plus-page book, published last year by Simon and Schuster, chronicled America’s contribution to the reconstruction of Europe in the emerging post-World War II world order. Timothy Naftali, writing in The New York Times Book Review, called it “trenchant and timely,” adding that “the architects of America’s global engagement after World War II would have been appalled that future generations — let alone a future president — might think they had been acting in anything but the national interest.”

In a statement, Mr. Steil, the director of international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations, echoed that point, indirectly linking his book to today’s debates about trade, global alliances and America’s place in the world.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>On July 1, 1942, the U.S.S. Wasp, an aircraft carrier holding 71 planes, 2,247 sailors and a journalist, sailed from San Diego to the western Pacific to join the battle against the Japanese. On board was a naval officer named Lt. Cmdr. John Joseph Shea. Two days before he left San Diego, Shea wrote his 5-year-old son a letter.

This is the first letter I have ever written directly to my little son and I am thrilled to know that you can read it all by yourself. If you miss some of the words, I am sure it will be because I do not write very plainly. Mother will help you in that case I am sure.

I was certainly glad to hear your voice over the long-distance telephone. It sounded as though I were right in the living room with you. You sounded as though you missed your daddy very much. I miss you too, more than anyone will ever know. It is too bad this war could not have been delayed a few more years so that I could grow up again with you and do with you all the things I planned to do when you were old enough to go to school.

I thought how nice it would be for me to come home early in the afternoon and play ball with you, and go mountain-climbing and see the trees, and brooks, and learn all about woodcraft, hunting, fishing, swimming and things like that. I suppose we must be brave and put these things off for a little while.

When you are a little bigger you will know why your daddy is not home so much any more. You know we have a big country and we have ideals as to how people should live and enjoy the riches of it and how each is born with equal rights to life, freedom and the pursuit of happiness. Unfortunately, there are some countries in the world where they don’t have these ideals, where a boy cannot grow up to be what he wants to be with no limits on his opportunities to be a great man, such as a great priest, statesman, doctor, soldier, business man etc.

Because there are people and countries who want to change our nation, its ideals, forms of government and way of life, we must leave our homes and families to fight. Fighting for the defense of our country, ideals, homes and honor is an honor and a duty which your daddy has to do before he can come home to settle down with you and Mother. When it is done, he is coming home to be with you always and forever. So wait just a little while longer. I am afraid it will be more than the two weeks you told me on the phone.

In the meantime, take good care of Mother. Be a good boy and grow up to be a good young man. Study hard when you go to school. Be a leader in everything good in life. Be a good Catholic, and you can’t help being a good American. Play fair always. Strive to win but if you must lose, lose like a gentleman and a good sportsman. Don’t ever be a quitter either in sports or in your business or profession when you grow up. Get all the education you can. Stay close to Mother and follow her advice. Obey her in everything, no matter how you may at times disagree. She knows what is best and will never let you down or lead you away from the right and honorable things in life. If I don’t get back, you will have to be Mother’s protector because you will be the only one she has. You must grow up to take my place as well as your own in her life and heart. Don’t let her brood over me nor waste herself on anyone not worthy of her or you.

Love your grandmother and granddad as long as they live. They, too, will never let you down. Love your aunts and see them as often as you can. Last of all, don’t ever forget your daddy. Pray for him to come back and if it is God’s will that he does not, be the kind of a boy and man your daddy wants you to be.

Thanks for the nice sweater and handkerchiefs and particularly for the note and card. Write me very often and tell me everything.

Kiss Mother for me every night.

With all my love and devotion for Mother and you,</TEXT>

      <TEXT>TRENTON — [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]

Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey, a Democrat who won a decisive victory two years ago by promoting a progressive agenda, wants to raise the income tax on those making more than $1 million to help pay for what he says are some of the state’s most pressing needs, including expanding preschool and making higher education more affordable.

His proposal, unveiled on Tuesday, is similar to the plan he pursued last year, which set off a confrontation with the Democratic-controlled Legislature that nearly shut down the state’s government and led Mr. Murphy to accept a compromise that raised taxes on a smaller pool of the wealthy.

But now the national conversation is much different: Progressive Democrats, including several candidates for president, have shifted the party to the left, arguing that taxing the wealthy will not only address growing income inequality, but will help pay for expansive social programs like Medicare for all that are priorities for the party’s more liberal wing.

Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has proposed an “ultramillionaire’s tax” that would impose a 2 percent tax on a household’s assets over $50 million, and an additional 1 percent on those exceeding $1 billion. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey has called for imposing a surtax on estates greater than $10 million.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Support for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights has increased or remained steady among Mormons, Muslims, political independents, Southerners, seniors and a number of other demographic groups in the United States since 2015, a new survey found. One notable outlier: young Republicans.

Between 2015 and 2018, support for laws aimed at protecting L.G.B.T. individuals from discrimination fell by nearly 10 percentage points among Republicans under the age of 30. This was one of the key findings from a survey of more than 40,000 Americans’ views on L.G.B.T. issues that the Public Religion Research Institute released Tuesday.

The majority of young Republicans surveyed — around 63 percent — continued to support such measures. But given that 74 percent were in favor in 2015, the shift was striking, said Robert P. Jones, the chief executive of the institute, a Washington-based nonpartisan nonprofit.

“It was one of the largest and most significant drops that we saw,” Dr. Jones said.

Understanding this shift would require additional study, he said, but one hypothesis he offered was that the ranks of young Republicans are thinning, with more socially liberal individuals opting to identify as independent. “The Republican Party is becoming more ideologically pure,” he suggested.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>But if finite funding is the reason these programs are limited in the first place, it seems clear that those limited funds may be better spent reducing the nontuition expenses of lower-income students.

Much of this misplaced prioritization has consequences that go beyond bad optics. According to The Hechinger Report, in 2017 alone, nearly a million low-income students “who applied for and were found eligible for state financial aid for college never received it, because states ran out of money.” The report estimates that the actual numbers are much worse, but that we are largely in the dark because many states don’t keep track of the students they have to turn down. We do know, however, that in 10 states — including blue ones like Oregon and Illinois as well red ones like Kansas — over half of students eligible for state grants didn’t receive them because resources ran out.

In the sphere of four-year education, things are especially dire. The maximum Pell Grant — which provides an invaluable assist for many community college students — now covers, on average, less than a third of the cost of attending a four-year public college or university. In a Darwinian twist, the cost of living is typically only offset only by selective merit stipends, available only for those lucky few who manage to attain scores that outperform advantaged students (who usually have accelerated schooling and tutoring) .

A 2018 report by the National College Access Network concluded that the average Pell grant recipient in 17 states and Puerto Rico can’t afford to attend a four-year public college and live on campus, even with grants, aid, loans and working full-time over the summer.

Instead of wrestling with the urgent implications of these realities, debates in policy circles too often skip straight to the supposed silver bullet of establishing a universal set of benefits to all students, with no accounting for financial resources — the thin subtext being that low-income people will need the buy-in of powerful upper-middle-class parents before education funding policies can be passed by legislatures and win sustained support among voters.

But states — which cannot, like the federal government, print money — have unique fiscal constraints that limit the possibilities of universal programs. And while Congress could solve everyone’s woes with sweeping universal legislation, that’s unlikely to pass any time in the foreseeable future. Altogether, it means there are real distributional trade-offs that must be made.

The Century Foundation explored this dilemma and found that free college programs, including those in states like Oklahoma aimed at low-income students, did not just survive but even grew in the face of a recession, despite other state-level cuts. A separate Ed Trust analysis also showed that college subsidy policies in Maryland, Oklahoma and Indiana , which targeted low-income students, better benefited students of color.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>HEMEL HEMPSTEAD, England — Martin Bradford played guitar at a local venue for the better part of a decade, but he avoids the place now because performing there would mean working with its sound engineer.

And that would not end well.

Sipping a pint in a riverside pub, Mr. Bradford recalls how he casually mentioned his vote to leave the European Union and instantly lost a friend.

“‘You’ve taken my retirement away,’” Mr. Bradford was told, the reasoning being that the sound engineer hoped to move to another European Union country, a right that Brexit could threaten.

“Once that conversation had happened there was no going back,” said Mr. Bradford, who also avoids members of his old band after some posted comments on social media that, he said, “painted the people who voted leave as racists, bigots, evil, stupid.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>HOUSTON — Is it time to go back to Neptune?

Scientists representing NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory proposed a spacecraft and mission on Tuesday at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Texas that would explore Triton, Neptune’s largest moon.

The unusual satellite is believed to be an object — similar in many ways to Pluto — from the solar system’s icy Kuiper belt that was captured billions of years ago by the giant planet’s gravity. And Triton is thought to harbor an ocean, hinting at the possibility that a world quite distant from the sun may contain the ingredients for life.

Unlike multibillion dollar proposals for spacecraft that the agency has usually sent to the outer solar system, this spacecraft, named Trident, aims to be far less expensive, the mission’s scientists and engineers said, or the price of a small mission to the moon.

“The time is now to do this mission,” said Louise Prockter, director of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston and the principal investigator of the proposed mission. “The time is now to do it at a low cost. And we will investigate whether it is a habitable world, which is of huge importance.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>In 2018, when the event was still on an island instead of in an N.F.L. stadium, Federer lost in his opening round to Thanasi Kokkinakis. Though Federer had another scare in the same round this year against the qualifier Radu Albot, he rallied to win in three sets and then gathered nothing but momentum, winning five straight matches in straight sets.

“It’s easy just to say, ‘Well last year didn’t work out, so I won’t come back this year, and as I’m playing the clay, maybe add rather another clay-court event,’ ” Federer said. “But I felt like let’s extend the hardcourt season. Let’s see the new venue. To be honest, I think that was something also I was excited to see. I did feel like the game was there last year, and I thought also the game was definitely here this year even after the Australian Open. So I’m happy with the team, we took the right decision.”

The team has also agreed that Federer will play on clay for the first time since brief, unfulfilling visits to Monte Carlo and Rome in 2016. His next tournament: Madrid in early May, which will give him time to reboot and reacquaint himself with the game’s grittiest surface.

How confident is he?

“Not very confident,” he said. “I don’t even remember how to slide anymore. You know, I’m taking baby steps at this point.”

It is smart, as ever, to try to underpromise and overdeliver, particularly when you are entering the kingdom of Nadal, the 11-time French Open champion and most successful men’s clay-court player in history.

But Federer, despite his fourth-round loss to Stefanos Tsitsipas at the Australian Open, has certainly had another hardcourt run to savor in 2019.

He looked thoroughly in his element on Sunday, just as Isner feared and expected he would.

“I knew he was going to play well today; I knew he was seeing the ball very big,” Isner said. “Certainly that was the case. I wasn’t up to the task in the first set, that’s for sure.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“Teachers don’t want to create frustration at home,” Ms. Fagell said. Often by alerting them to what is going on, they will be willing to modify an assignment to help your child complete it himself.

And if the teacher doesn’t get the hint, be blunt and say that the assignment is simply beyond your child’s ability to complete alone.

“That’s feedback that the teacher should want,” said Laura Guarino, associate dean of children’s programs at Bank Street College of Education.

But if you complain, will the teacher be offended and take it out on your child?

“People always worry that if you ruffle feathers, it will impact how your teacher will look at your child,” said Ms. Guarino.

So enter the conversation with the goal of impressing on the teacher that you want to be able to understand the school’s goals around homework, and how they fit into the curriculum.

“The people who enter a conversation from a place of curiosity are the ones we know are willing to partner with our school to do the best for their child,” said Jed Lippard, dean of children’s programs at Bank Street. “Try inquiry before advocacy.”

So I mentioned to my daughter’s teacher that I felt a little daunted by dressing my daughter as one of the fuzzy, bulbous creatures from the Dr. Seuss books, and she steered me toward printing out a photo of a red fish and taping it to her shirt, as in “One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish.” That lowered the bar, and my stress level. Not wanting tape on her shirt, my daughter ending up dressing in a white shirt, black skirt and red bow as Sally, the do-gooder little girl from “The Cat in the Hat,” and I didn’t have to sew, glue or print out a single thing.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>What Mr. Guare seems to be after is a dramaturgy that is absurdist not for its own sake but as a kind of last-ditch naturalism, replicating the absurdity of actual life with all its serendipities, hyperlinks, potholes and misprisions. He is one of our few major dramatists who dares to make plays from the kinds of anecdotes about which we say at cocktail parties: “If this were a play, you’d never believe it.”

But if Mr. Guare’s earlier excursions in the anecdotal style made you feel like guests at just such a party, “Nantucket Sleigh Ride” (like “A Free Man of Color” in 2010) makes you feel like you’re stranded at one, in a corner with a drunk. Despite some heavy pruning and reshaping since it was first produced (under the title “Are You There, McPhee?”) at the McCarter Theater in 2012, it remains, in Jerry Zaks’s zippy, overbright staging for Lincoln Center Theater, both hermitic and hermetic: obscure and airless.

[What’s new onstage and off: Sign up for our Theater Update newsletter]

That’s not a great environment for audiences — or actors — to thrive in. Mr. Larroquette has the right combination of swagger and self-doubt but spends most of the play nursing the harried affect of someone running for a bus that keeps shutting its doors every time he catches up. The rest of the cast, which includes several experienced farceurs and shape-shifters, is forced into more or less impossible contortions of whimsy, a job for which only Douglas Sills (as a shrink, the children’s father and Disney) seems factory-equipped.

Still, you may get a shiver of the dark anxiety hiding in the writing as a ghost hides in a child’s crowded closet: Without other people to confirm your identity, you have none. Nor is that an anxiety that, for a playwright, gets better with age. Mr. Guare is 81, and while “Nantucket Sleigh Ride” is hardly valedictory, it does betray doubts about ongoing fecundity.

“Lightning struck me once,” Gowery says with an equanimity the play proceeds to topple. “That’s once more than it strikes most people.” Another character helpfully points out that Verdi’s “Otello” and “Falstaff” were written when the composer was nearing 90 — which, perhaps deliberately, is at least a decade off.

Though I find his plays fresher when he writes for female protagonists instead of male ones — the women here are basically tchotchkes — Mr. Guare need not have worried about the friskiness of his imagination or the seaworthiness of his craft. They’re fine.

“Nantucket Sleigh Ride,” it seems to me, is simply a story that didn’t want to be caught. Even the title seems to know it: It’s a local term for what happens when a whaler harpoons a whale. After hours or days of wild exertion, one or the other winds up dead.

Or sometimes the audience does.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The Pentagon said that a test on Monday of a new tactic for intercepting missiles aimed at American cities was a success, in an exercise that appeared intended to simulate how the United States would defend against an adversary like North Korea.

The test, the first in nearly two years, was conducted over the Pacific Ocean. It fired two “interceptors” from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California against a mock warhead launched from Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands.

“The system worked exactly as it was designed to do,” Air Force Lt. Gen. Samuel A. Greaves, director of the Pentagon’s Missile Defense Agency, said in a statement. “This test demonstrates that we have a capable, credible deterrent against a very real threat.”

Evaluating the success of missile interceptions is difficult. In the past, the Missile Defense Agency has been accused of exaggerating its “kills” in order to quiet critics who say a 50 percent successful interception rate is far from satisfactory.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>SYDNEY, Australia — Money raised for a teenager who shot to worldwide fame after smashing an egg on the head of an Australian far-right politician will go toward the victims of the New Zealand mosque shootings, according to his fund-raising page.

On Tuesday morning, a GoFundMe page for Will Connolly, now commonly known as Egg Boy, had already surpassed its goal of raising 50,000 Australian dollars, about $35,000. An update on the page said the 17-year-old Mr. Connolly “plans to send a majority of the money to the victims of the Christchurch terror attack.” The funds were originally intended to cover his legal fees and to help him buy “more eggs.”

The teenager gained fame after smashing an egg on the head of Fraser Anning, an anti-immigration senator, as the senator spoke to reporters in Melbourne, Australia, on Friday. The incident happened after Mr. Anning was widely condemned for a statement he made that day blaming Muslim immigration for Friday’s massacre in Christchurch, New Zealand.

After getting hit with the egg, Mr. Anning turned around and struck Mr. Connolly in the face twice. A brawl broke out that ended with Mr. Connolly being pinned down by men in the crowd. Mr. Connolly was arrested at the scene and released pending further investigation, the police said.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Democrats have been divided along racial and religious lines this week as they debated how to respond to Ms. Omar, one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress. She has faced accusations of anti-Semitism for weeks.

The details: Only Republicans voted no in the 407-to-23 vote. Here’s how every representative voted.

A ruling by a federal appeals court on Thursday broadened constitutional protections for undocumented immigrants at the border, opening a potential new legal gateway for some to stay in the country.

President Trump has said that migrants exploit the asylum system, and his administration has made applying harder.

Related: Activists and journalists received additional scrutiny when they entered the U.S. last year, according to a government document. Those on the list had traveled with migrant caravans from Central America as they arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border to seek asylum.

Yesterday: The Census Bureau will tap Department of Homeland Security files on millions of immigrants, including noncitizens, as part of the 2020 census, bureau officials said. Outside experts said the data request did not necessarily indicate an attempt to sidestep recent judicial rulings that banned a question about citizenship.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“I saw the remark that she made,” Mr. Pompeo said of Ms. Choe. “We are hopeful that we can continue to have conversations and negotiations.”

Mr. Pompeo added that Mr. Kim had made multiple promises during the Hanoi summit meeting to Mr. Trump that he would take steps to wind down his nuclear program. Despite the unpredictable messaging, he said, the administration would continue to take Mr. Kim at his word.

Mr. Bolton, for his part, told reporters at the White House that any suggestion that he and Mr. Pompeo undermined the negotiations were inaccurate, and that he had been in touch with national security officials in South Korea about the remarks.

“We’ve discussed their reaction and our reaction,” Mr. Bolton said. “I’d like to speak further within the U.S. government before we respond.”

The office of South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, who did much to broker the talks between the North and the United States, said it was closely monitoring the situation. “Whatever the situation, our government will try its best to help resume North Korea-U.S. negotiations,” it said in a statement.

The breakdown of the Hanoi meeting revealed a wide gap between North Korea and the United States over how to proceed with denuclearization.

North Korea insisted, as it has before, on moving in phases. In Hanoi, Mr. Kim offered to dismantle the plutonium, uranium-enrichment and other facilities at its Yongbyon site, north of Pyongyang, and demanded that Washington in return lift crucial sanctions that have been imposed on the North since 2016.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. — By contending this week at the Players Championship, Rory McIlroy is delivering a reminder that the rounds are long, but the years are short.

A cherubic-cheeked McIlroy turned 20 on Monday of his debut at the PGA Tour’s flagship event at TPC Sawgrass in 2009; four days later, he missed his first, and only, cut of that tour season. He has since collected 14 tour victories, including four majors, and held the men’s world No. 1 ranking on seven occasions.

Next month, McIlroy will make his fifth attempt to complete a career Grand Slam at the Masters, but first things first: On Sunday he will aim to close out a victory after a number of close calls this year.

With a two-under-par 70 on Saturday, McIlroy is tied for second with Tommy Fleetwood (70) at 14 under, one stroke behind Jon Rahm of Spain, who carded a 64, one stroke shy of the course record. The key to Rahm’s resplendent round was the four par-5s, which he covered in five under — five strokes better than McIlroy and two better than Fleetwood.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Officials inside the Justice Department are preparing for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, to deliver his confidential report on the investigation’s findings to William P. Barr, the attorney general, according to multiple people inside the department who have been briefed on the planning. Mr. Barr will then summarize those findings and present them to Congress.

But the White House legal team and others have incorrectly predicted an imminent end to the investigation for more than a year. And Democratic lawmakers have vowed to obtain Mr. Mueller’s full report, no matter what Mr. Barr presents to them, guaranteeing that the submission of the report will not end debate over the Mueller inquiry and its findings. The House voted overwhelmingly on Thursday to pass a bipartisan resolution calling on Mr. Barr to release the full findings of the special counsel’s investigation to the public.

Mr. Weissmann, 60, has been considered a key player on Mr. Mueller’s team and one of its most aggressive prosecutors.

A graduate of Princeton University and Columbia Law School, Mr. Weissman previously worked as general counsel at the F.B.I. while Mr. Mueller was the director.

He gained a reputation as one of the most relentless prosecutors in the case against Enron, the energy company implicated in a widespread accounting fraud. Not only did he secure indictments of the company’s top officers, Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey Skilling, he also charged the wife of the company’s chief financial officer with tax fraud and won a case against Enron’s accounting firm, Arthur Anderson, which helped lead to the firm’s demise. The Supreme Court eventually overturned the decision in the Arthur Andersen case.

Within Mr. Mueller’s team, Mr. Weissmann maintained his own office, a sign of his seniority.

He helped construct the cases against Mr. Manafort, Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager, and Mr. Gates, who was Mr. Manafort’s business partner and later deputy on the Trump campaign.

Mr. Manafort was convicted on financial fraud charges stemming from his political consulting work in Ukraine and pleaded guilty to conspiracy and obstruction of justice in two separate court cases.

This Friday there will be a status hearing for Mr. Gates, whose sentencing has been delayed four times. He pleaded guilty to charges of financial fraud and lying to investigators and has been cooperating with the special counsel.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The slim size of “Rag,” a disturbing, forceful story collection by Maryse Meijer, belies the profusion of terrors contained within it. No matter how ordinary or powerless the character, to each unfortunate soul yet inheres a magnificent, perhaps infinite, capacity for suffering. “If she had wanted something nice to happen to her she would have chosen someone nice” serves both as a description of one woman’s open-eyed masochism and a cautionary banner over a book that could be read as a field guide to varieties of misery, much of which is experienced by women and girls.

In Meijer’s sharp, haunting stories, most of that violence is perpetrated by men — a note she sounds without attenuation, in a way that will undoubtedly call forth protests of “Not all…” in some readers and approving nods of “Right, right, the patriarchy is a horror show” in others. Men are more violent than women, a fact we are prone to invoking not as a statistic but either meekly, as a quandary, or gravely, as a judgment; at a time of viral outrage like the #MeToo moment, we may sense gradations but are afraid to be labeled apologists. Yet the effect of a fairy tale, a designation often applied to Meijer’s work — a previous collection of stories, “Heartbreaker,” and a novella, “Northwood” — depends on its clear delineation of good and evil. To understand the monstrous we must draw a monster so unmistakable as to represent the opposite of an equally unmistakable innocence or virtue. To this end, then, let the man be volatile, depraved and abusive, duplicitous if not hateful, creepy if not a rapist, feckless if not heartless.

Opening with “Her Blood,” a story about a grisly miscarriage, and closing with “Rag,” an experimental fable about a dreadfully intimate murder, Meijer traverses an impressive range of emotional, psychological and physical traumas, with a near-total investment in sketching atrocity rather than deciphering it. In that undertaking she certainly succeeds. She writes wonderfully of the trap of the self, with its impossible prisons of circumstance and identity, not to mention the perversity of being buried alive, alone, inside a body. She has a strong facility for translating interior states — “He wonders if he should give the boy money. Or a hug. He needs to figure out the appropriate gesture and then make it so he can go” — and for making acute, satisfying observations: “But the house wasn’t empty. You can always tell. The pressure of living, no matter how small, pushes out from a place.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Brad Marchand scored a power-play goal early in the opening period and Tuukka Rask made it stand up with 20 saves for his third shutout of the season, lifting the surging Boston Bruins to a 1-0 victory at home against the Devils on Saturday night.

The victory improved the Bruins’ streak of at least a point in every game to 16 (12-0-4). They have not lost in regulation since a 3-2 setback to the Rangers on Jan. 19. It is their longest such run since an 18-game surge (14-0-4) last season. Rask is 14-0-3 in his last 17 starts.

Mackenzie Blackwood stopped 29 shots for the Devils, including a penalty shot by Marchand. The Devils, who have lost five of seven, were shut out for the first time since a 3-0 loss to Columbus on Dec. 23.

You realize it’s 1-nothing, but it’s not like I feel a ton of pressure to not let another one in,” Blackwood said. “It’s more so I want to keep feeling good about my game to give the guys a chance.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The banning of cash in retail establishments is understandable from the stores’ perspective. Among other things, it eliminates the need to deal in cash, which requires trips to and from the bank, cash registers, employees who still know how to make change, and the risk of embezzlement and robbery. No wonder stores are willing to pay credit card issuers up to 5 percent off the top.

But for the disadvantaged who have not established a credit rating or who have other impediments to obtaining a credit or debit card, like undocumented immigrants, it can be a great hardship. And what meaning is left in the statement on every dollar bill and on all the higher denominations as well: “This note is leg al tender for all debts, public and private”?

If that statement is the law, how can any store refuse to accept cash?</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Last summer, after Christine Blasey Ford said that Judge Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when they were in high school, Mr. Avenatti came forward with another accuser, Julie Swetnick. With little detail, Ms. Swetnick escalated the allegations, describing parties attended by the judge’s circle of friends, where she said girls had been gang-raped.

On the eve of Dr. Blasey and Judge Kavanaugh’s testimony to Congress, some felt the claims brought by Mr. Avenatti’s client were gasoline on a fire, intensifying the political frenzy around what was widely considered a test for the #MeToo movement. Noting inconsistencies in Ms. Swetnick’s account, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee questioned whether Mr. Avenatti had deliberately misled Congress and referred him and his client for criminal investigation.

In his push against the judge, Mr. Avenatti said he had witnesses who could corroborate his client’s claims, but he never brought any forward publicly. (Last week, he said he still believed his client, and he reiterated that he had called for an F.B.I. inquiry to interview witnesses.) And at the peak of the Stormy Daniels case, he said he had more women alleging hush money payments tied to Mr. Trump, but he produced none.

Mr. Avenatti denied that he had chased the cases for attention.

“I haven’t repositioned myself to remain in the spotlight,” he said, claiming he had received 50 to 200 unsolicited requests for representation daily over the last year. “In many instances, the cases that I’ve gotten involved in have changed the spotlight.”

Though he never held political office, when Mr. Avenatti hinted at a run for president, he was taken somewhat seriously. “We must be a party that fights fire with fire,” Mr. Avenatti said at a Democratic fund-raiser in Iowa in August, sounding like a candidate. “When they go low, I say hit back harder.”

He bristled at the idea that he had emerged out of nowhere.

“I don’t feel like I get enough credit for my track record of success relating to cases,” Mr. Avenatti said, raising his voice with exasperation. “People act like I was a nobody before Stormy Daniels, and it’s ridiculous.”

As a plaintiff’s lawyer, Mr. Avenatti had won some big settlements. He sued KPMG for audit malpractice, and the company settled for $22 million. He won $80 million from a cemetery accused of overstuffing its plots, and half a billion from the makers of defective surgical gowns. Two of his cases before Ms. Daniels had landed him on “60 Minutes,” he pointed out.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>There are plenty of fine online periodicals, of course, but those were designed with the logic of the internet in mind. The local paper, on the other hand, was meant to draw a picture of a physical community, with its customs, rituals, manners, lingo and collective memory inscribed in a thousand minute ways. Even if you get it only for the yard-sale ads or to hate-read the letters column, its presence itself is reassuring, part of the sometimes thin fabric that holds you and your neighbors together. But if you can’t buy it at the gas station along with your six pack and your night crawlers, it might as well not exist.

Nevertheless, even as the physical newspaper is diminished in numbers, it bows to no product in the modernity and total awesomeness of its production. As these spectacular photos by Christopher Payne show, this paper is produced in College Point, Queens, on machines the size of large houses, which do everything from the unwinding of the paper rolls to the folding of the complete sections. Each tower prints 28 spreads at once, front and back, in cyan, magenta, yellow and black, at ridiculous speed — 80,000 copies an hour can be produced this way. And then you can hold it in your hand, fold it, tear it, use it as a rain hat — a voluminous paper object with visual dazzle and hundreds of thousands of words, representing the collected information of that moment: news, opinion, analysis, testimony, critique, charts, graphs, photos, displays. And it happens every day, over and over again. Small wonder they call it The Daily Miracle. — Luc Sante

But in the age of the 21st-century superfan, perhaps no group is more emphatic, organized and passionate online than the devotees of Michael Jackson, the King of Pop whose legacy includes decades of innuendo and court cases regarding what he did or did not do with young boys.

Across blogs, message boards, podcasts, YouTube videos and especially social media feeds, where a Jackson avatar broadcasts one’s allegiance, they circulate exhaustive evidence that they view as exonerating for the singer, while shouting down news outlets they consider inaccurate and biased.</TEXT>

The cases, each of which contains about eight five-pound bags, were mostly sold to the Publix supermarket chain and to Winn-Dixie markets, both of which have branches throughout the Southeast. The cases have best if used by dates of either April 19, 2020 , or April 20, 2020.

The Food and Drug Administration posted a notice on its Twitter and Facebook accounts Monday . But a spokesman noted that the F.D.A. had so far identified this as a Class 2 recall, which means that the agency is monitoring the situation but has not issued a more formal alert, because no one has reported becoming ill from the flour.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson will return to television after the broadcasters of his shows announced Friday that they had completed their investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against him.

“The investigation is complete, and we are moving forward with both ‘StarTalk’ and ‘Cosmos,’” Fox Broadcasting and National Geographic said of his two shows. “‘StarTalk’ will return to the air with the remaining 13 episodes in April on National Geographic, and both Fox and National Geographic are committed to finding an air date for ‘Cosmos.’ There will be no further comment.”

The statement did not say what investigators concluded about the complaints. Dr. Tyson was accused in December of behaving inappropriately with two women, in an article published by the website Patheos.

One accusation came from Ashley Watson, his assistant on “Cosmos,” who said that during a visit to his apartment, which she took to be a work visit, he made her feel uncomfortable by holding her hands and looking into her eyes in what he called a Native American handshake. As she was leaving, she said, he told her, “I want you to know that I want to hug you so bad right now, but I know that if I do I’ll just want more.” She quit the show.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Animal Care Centers, a nonprofit that provides animal control services for the city, also cared for the goat, which was found in the Bronx on Sunday, and the lamb, which was found on the Gowanus Expressway in Brooklyn last Wednesday. Ms. Hansen said rescue workers named the goat Billy, and the lamb Petunia.

While the calf made his way to Harlem, Ms. Hansen said center employees cleared some dogs out of a play area in the backyard and set up an area for him, complete with a mound of hay.

When he arrived, the calf was led through the back gate “so he wouldn’t have to walk through the actual shelter” and was then left to have some peace and quiet, she said. Escaped farm animals, in particular, tend to be stressed out by their ordeal.

“They are in new surroundings and they have just run away from a place where they most likely sensed danger,” she said. “Now they are surrounded by unfamiliar smells and there are no other animals that look like them around, so that is scary. Their adrenaline is probably rushing.”

Ms. Hansen said the calf, like the goat and the lamb before him, was sent to Skyland Sanctuary in Wantage, N.J. The other goat was sent on Tuesday night to Farm Sanctuary in Watkins Glen, N.Y., which is well known for its association with the comedian Jon Stewart.

Sending an animal to a nearby sanctuary is standard procedure because slaughterhouses tend to be located close together, making it difficult to determine which one may be missing the odd pig or goat even when they are tagged, Ms. Hansen said.

Allie Feldman Taylor, the president of Voters for Animal Rights, said there are about 80 slaughterhouses in New York City. Ms. Hansen said if one of them comes forward and claims an escaped animal, it is returned to them. But that rarely happens.

“Probably because of public outcry,” she said. “When people really think about what they are eating, I guess it affects them in that way.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>A teenage relative spends occasional weekends with us in the city, mostly to escape her sheltered life at home. She loves going to museums, shopping and even having dinner with us at our favorite diner. And we like having her. But the last two times she stayed over, we noticed objects of sentimental value were missing. The first time, we assumed we misplaced it. But after the second incident, we believe she took them. No one else had access to them. Should we say something?

Just don’t call her behavior “a silent cry for help,” O.K.? Because that’s a lame bromide that raises more issues than it resolves: Who’s supposed to answer her cries, for instance? And what if she rejects the help? As a former sticky-fingered teen, though, I’m glad you wrote. I think you may be able to help her.

Don’t lob the issue straight to her parents. They may take offense at your allegation or simply ask the girl directly. And if she’s anything like I was, she will deny everything, especially to her parents. Save that option for later.

Wait until the girl’s next visit. Then say, “There are many reasons that kids your age steal things: They feel stressed or powerless or bad about themselves, and want to be caught and punished. We don’t know if any of these apply to you. We think you’re great. But some things went missing after you visited, and no one else could have taken them. Can we talk about it?”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Amid a renewed national conversation about childhood vaccinations, Gov. Matt Bevin of Kentucky said this week that he and his wife made sure all nine of their children got chickenpox.

“Every single one of my kids had the chickenpox,” Mr. Bevin said in an interview on Tuesday with a radio station in Bowling Green, Ky. “They got the chickenpox on purpose because we found a neighbor that had it and I went and made sure every one of my kids was exposed to it, and they got it. They had it as children. They were miserable for a few days, and they all turned out fine.”

Experts said that the practice Mr. Bevin described was antiquated, a holdover from the days before 1995, when a vaccine for chickenpox became publicly available. Back then, so-called chickenpox parties were set up to spread the disease from one child to the next, under the belief that contracting chickenpox as a young child was safer than as an adult.

Doctors said the method can lead to dangerous complications or death. Still, Tara C. Smith, a professor of epidemiology at Kent State University in Ohio who studies infectious diseases, said that despite warnings from medical experts and the availability of vaccines, the practice of deliberately exposing children to disease continues.</TEXT>

Driving in Manhattan may never be the same again.

It will soon cost more — well over $10 — to drive into the busiest neighborhoods, from 60th Street in Midtown all the way to the Battery.

The fees are part of a groundbreaking congestion pricing plan in the new $175 billion New York State budget, which Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and lawmakers agreed upon early Sunday morning.

New York will become the first American city to charge such fees, though congestion pricing has been in place for years in London, Stockholm and Singapore, among other communities. The fees are expected to raise billions of dollars to fix the city’s troubled subway system and thin out streets that have become strangled by traffic.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Last year, one of my best friends learned he had cancer.

In many respects he was lucky. He had great insurance. He had enough money. Partly because one of his friends (me) is well connected in the health care system, he got excellent care.

So this is not a story about how the system failed, or how people need insurance or access. He had those. He got the care. This is the United States health care system at its peak performance.

But I was utterly floored by how hard it all was.

Americans spend so much time debating so many aspects of health care, including insurance and access. Almost none of that covers the actual impossibility and hardship faced by the many millions of friends and family members who are caregivers. It’s hugely disrupting and expensive. There’s no system for it. It’s a gaping hole.

My friend, Jim Fleischer, missed a few days of work as the diagnosis was made, then missed many more after surgery. His wife, Ali, had to take time off. His mother-in-law had to come and help take care of him and the children when Ali had to go back to work (she’s a teacher).</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Six new paperbacks to check out this week.

NO TURNING BACK: Life, Loss, and Hope in Wartime Syria, by Rania Abouzeid. (Norton, $17.95.) Abouzeid has spent years on the ground in Syria covering the civil war, and she combines extraordinary reporting with a historical and political overview of the origins of the conflict. In her book she focuses on a small group of characters, and their stories offer an intimate look at the impact of violence and tragedy.

A GENTLEMAN IN MOSCOW, by Amor Towles. (Penguin, $17.) In Towles’s hugely popular novel, an aristocrat under arrest watches from a posh hotel as the Russian Revolution unfolds. Our reviewer, Craig Taylor, wrote, “What saves the book is the gorgeous sleight of hand that draws it to a satisfying end, and the way he chooses themes that run deeper than mere sociopolitical commentary.”

LOOK ALIVE OUT THERE: Essays, by Sloane Crosley. (Picador/MCD, $17.) Fans of Crosley, the author of “I Was Told There’d Be Cake” and “How Did You Get This Number,” will be pleased to see her signature wit on full display in this new collection. The pieces draw on everything from her volcano-scaling escapades to the death of her solitary downstairs neighbor. Her observations, even the most sobering, are shot through with hope.

THE BALCONY, by Jane Delury. (Back Bay/Little, Brown, $15.99.) This debut novel leaps back and forth to tell the stories of a property’s inhabitants, starting in the 19th century through the recent past. The state of the house, from dilapidation to haphazard renovation, mirrors the shifting relationships among its residents, including a Jewish family in hiding, a former courtesan and more. Our reviewer, Jan Stuart, praised the novel, writing, “The vivid intimacy of Delury’s canvas is enhanced by descriptive prose at once concise and lush.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>What gives the work of Merce Cunningham its thrill? Why does watching it feel, at times, as if you’re standing at the edge of a precipice?

There was space to ponder these questions on Friday at the 92nd Street Y, at the opening of the 25th Harkness Dance Festival, one of many events this year honoring the 100th anniversary of Cunningham’s birth. While the rest of the monthlong festival highlights his descendants — artists who danced for him and went on to make their own work — Friday’s “Feast of Cunningham” sampled his vast repertory, bringing together seasoned Cunningham dancers with newcomers to his oeuvre.

The thrill factor, of course, has to do with who’s dancing. And on this program, it spiked when Melissa Toogood — a member of the Cunningham company’s final generation — shared the stage with the American Ballet Theater soloist Calvin Royal III. There were also valiant performances from New York Theater Ballet, in “Septet” (1953) and “Cross Currents” (1964), as well as students from the New World School of the Arts in Miami, who danced a MinEvent (or collage of Cunningham excerpts) staged by Ms. Toogood. But it was Ms. Toogood and Mr. Royal, in a couple of too-fleeting duets, who most embodied a sense of transcending the impossible.</TEXT>

• One of President Trump’s goals was to narrow the country’s trade deficit. But amid a global economic slowdown, weaker demand for American goods, a trade war with Beijing and Mr. Trump’s $1.5 trillion tax cut, the trade deficit has hit a record $891 billion.
• Michael Cohen, Mr. Trump’s former lawyer, gave documents to the House Intelligence Committee that back up his claim that Mr. Trump’s current personal lawyers worked on the false testimony he delivered to Congress.
• Mr. Trump’s lead lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, said that lawyers for several people facing scrutiny in the investigations into the Trump campaign and presidency had contacted him to see whether the president would pardon their clients.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>There are no easy answers here. Reducing opioid prescriptions is important. But it needs to be done in a smarter way.

The Washington Post ran a good op-ed on the subject this week, written by John Heubusch, the executive director of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute and himself a sufferer of chronic pain. I want to quote from it at some length.

Many doctors, Heubusch writes, “have turned away from their patients in chronic pain.” The real problem, he says, is not excess pills that happen to be prescribed by well-meaning doctors. It is “the illegal trafficking of opioids on the street where you live.”

He continues: “The C.D.C.’s intended audience should have been small; a limited number of bad actors and a minority of doctors overprescribing for short-term pain were the C.D.C.’s real target. But the guidelines were ambiguous and short-sighted. The immediate result: confusion at major medical conferences, inside hospital boardrooms and, most troubling, in just about every doctor’s office.”

In his own case, Heubusch writes, “I’ve had to undergo countless unsuccessful procedures and near superhuman efforts to be granted barely enough medication to try to live a normal life. Even those doctors with the courage to prescribe them for chronic pain sufferers are finding the hurdles established by federal and state reporting requirements so onerous that they are simply turning patients away.”

It’s possible to reduce the horrific toll of opioid misuse and overuse without causing so much harm to people like Heubusch. And there are a lot of people like him.

As the National Institutes of Health has reported: “An estimated 25.3 million adults (11.2 percent) had pain every day for the preceding 3 months. Nearly 40 million adults (17.6 percent) experience severe levels of pain.”

Related: The author Maia Szalavitz argues in a recent Times Op-Ed that the C.D.C.’s “attempt to save people from addiction is leaving many patients in perpetual pain — and thus inadvertently ruining, or even ending, lives.”

      <TEXT>LONDON — Royal Dutch Shell, which is on trial in Italy over alleged corruption stemming from a $1.3 billion oil deal in Nigeria, now appears likely to face legal proceedings over the same issue in its home country, the Netherlands.

Shell said on Friday that the Dutch Public Prosecutor’s Office had warned that it was preparing to prosecute the giant oil company “for criminal charges directly or indirectly related” to a Nigerian oil deal that occurred in 2011.

A spokeswoman for the Dutch prosecutor’s office, Valentine Hoen, said that based on the investigation so far “we concluded there are prosecutable offenses.” However, she said, inquires were continuing, and no decision had been made on what if any actions would follow.

A trial in the Netherlands would mark a significant expansion of the corruption case, and risk damaging Shell’s reputation as a major player in the global oil business. The legal woes might also further complicate Shell’s operations in Nigeria, where for years it has been a major producer of oil and gas.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>And yet, it’s hard to see how places like New Zealand can ever feel safe without some changes internationally. “We need to understand American laws because they affect us,” one commentator said on Radio New Zealand this week.

Indeed the lack of legislative effort by American lawmakers on the issues that helped spawn the Christchurch attack — guns, racism and tech platforms — is no longer just a frustration in the United States. Now it wounds the world.

There’s hard work to be done for that to change. The solution is not praying for victims or praising Ms. Ardern on Twitter. What New Zealanders want is for Americans to learn from others, for globalization to go the other way, even if it means limitations on fundamental U.S. of A. freedoms.

On guns, countries like New Zealand have less to confront: Of the 3.9 million New Zealanders of gun-licensing age, 238,000 — just 6 percent — have a firearm license, according to the website GunPolicy.org. In the United States, three in 10 adults say they own a firearm.

Tech companies are another challenge. Despite a growing body of research showing that the algorithms of YouTube, Facebook and other social media platforms push people further into violent extremism, getting those companies and their employees to dial back their self-regard and shift their priorities may be as hard as persuading gun owners to give up their AR-15s.

And let’s be honest: Those are the easy things to fix compared with racism and white supremacy.

Some Muslims in Christchurch are hoping that the unity of the community and New Zealand officials will set a new standard.

“If we can use what happened here to say enough is enough, if we can promote what we call in New Zealand ‘aroha,’” said Mustafa Farouk, president of the Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand, using the Maori word for love, “maybe the people behind these shootings will change.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Yet by implying that inflation needs to be monitored, she also implied that the government shouldn’t borrow and spend excessively, with which I heartily agree.

Furthermore, she was right to say that, in some cases, Americans overreact to government deficits. In fact, there is a long history of disputes by accountants on how deficits should be defined. For example, it has been proposed that the federal government should adopt separate capital and operating budgets — differentiating long-term investments from operating costs.

But it is not obvious how to do this, and the change has not been made. These accounting issues are technical and don’t provide useful slogans for influencing public opinion, as modern monetary theory does.

Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York may be the theory’s most visible supporter. In her advocacy of the Green New Deal program that she introduced with a fellow Democrat, Senator Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, she has used the theory to dismiss criticisms that increased spending would require increased taxation.

Yet the Green New Deal — which the Republican-controlled Senate rejected on Tuesday in a procedural vote — looks awfully expensive. When the cost of her plan was pointed out to her in a National Public Radio interview with Steve Inskeep last month, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said: “I think the first thing that we need to do is kind of break the mistaken idea that taxes pay for a hundred percent of government expenditure.”

When pressed, however, she said,“When we decide to go into the realm of deficit spending, we have to do so responsibly.” Because there are great opportunities for government investment at the moment and interest rates are low, these programs should go forward with deficit spending. Once again, this is a conventional argument: It makes sense to spend when the return on government investments exceeds the borrowing rate.

These are reasonable ideas. They are not always expressed in ways that are appealing to mainstream economists, however, so it’s not surprising that two Harvard economists recently wrote articles severely criticizing modern monetary theory. Kenneth Rogoff did so in “Modern Monetary Nonsense,” while Lawrence Summers wrote, “The Left’s Embrace of Modern Monetary Theory Is a Recipe for Disaster.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>KIEV, Ukraine — A Ukrainian comedian who plays an accidental president on television delivered a walloping rebuke to the country’s political class in the presidential election on Sunday by emerging first in a crowded field of candidates, exit polls indicated.

The comedian, Volodymyr Zelensky, 41, captured more than 30 percent of the vote, according to two authoritative exit polls. It was a strong showing by a maverick with no political experience, though far below the 50 percent needed to win the first round outright.

If exit polls translate into real votes, Mr. Zelensky will face President Petro O. Poroshenko, who emerged second with around 18 percent, in a runoff in three weeks, on April 21. Yulia V. Tymoshenko, a former prime minister making her third bid for the presidency, was third with about 13 percent.

Official results are not due until Monday, and there will most likely be challenges, but the exit polls all reflected roughly the same results predicted by surveys before the vote. Turnout was estimated at about 63 percent in an electorate of 30 million people, slightly ahead of the 60 percent who voted in 2014.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>At a time when measles outbreaks are mounting among clusters of unvaccinated children, notably in Washington State, New York and Texas, a new large study published this week found no association between the measles vaccine and autism — a reason often given by parents for rejecting inoculation.

The new research confirms what has long been widely accepted in the scientific community, and it echoes findings of a 2002 study by members of the same team of scientists about the vaccine, known as MMR because it protects against measles, mumps and rubella.

But the findings come at a moment of resurging suspicion about vaccine safety, that has been promulgated at the far edges of the internet and on mainstream sites such as Amazon, Facebook and Pinterest. Many of those companies have taken steps in recent weeks to remove anti-vaccine content, but on Monday, the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, Dr. Kyle E. Yasuda, wrote to the chief executives of Google, Facebook and Pinterest, urging further action in “an urgent request to work together to combat the dangerous spread of vaccine misinformation online.”

In emphatic language, the researchers, who followed 657,461 Danish children born between 1999 and 2010, stated in the Annals of Internal Medicine: “The study strongly supports that MMR vaccination does not increase the risk for autism, does not trigger autism in susceptible children, and is not associated with clustering of autism cases after vaccination.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>My gardener is a lovely man who lives in a home with his wife and two children about three blocks away. About eight years ago, I hired him to cut the grass along the boulevard in front of our house. He comes by when the grass needs cutting and does a fabulous job. Occasionally I hire him for a big spring or fall yard cleanup as well.

Since the beginning, he has been slow to bill me for his work. I initially agreed to pay him once a month, but the invoices were often late, and as the years wore on he began billing me once a year for the entire summer’s work. I told him that was fine with me, if that was his preference. He always says he is trying to get around to his books and will bill me soon.

Eventually, he stopped billing me altogether. It has been two years since I’ve paid him, during which time he has faithfully continued to cut the grass. Feeling horrible about this, I wrote a check for an amount I figured was close to what I owe him and dropped it in his mailbox. That was two months ago, and I have confirmed he received it. The check remains uncashed.

This is making me crazy as I hate owing people money and feel I am taking advantage of him. My husband laughs and tells me I’ve done my best to pay him and to quit nagging the poor guy. I don’t want to fire him and hire someone else as it would likely hurt his feelings. He does good work, and at these rates, I certainly won’t find a better price. But can I in good conscience let him continue to work free? Name Withheld

You can’t force someone to cash a check. And you can’t leave large amounts of cash in a mailbox. So the ball is now in his court. But there’s some interesting moral psychology here. People often dislike being indebted to others. In an odd way, it can make us feel that a certain patronage has been established: The person in whose debt we are has put himself in a position to lord it over us. In some societies, people feel this so strongly that they actively resent those who put them in their debt. You say you don’t like to feel as if you’re taking advantage, but some version of this debt aversion may nag at you as well. Try leaving a note that says: “Please cash my check. Do it for my sake. I would be happier if I knew I had paid you for the excellent work you do.”

I recently visited friends at their home. They proudly showed me their antiques and art collection. Although I am not an antique dealer or art appraiser, I know that the jade horse was a cheap Chinese marble reproduction, as was 85 percent of their furniture. The other 15 percent could possibly be as well. Here’s the question: Knowing they just spent a small fortune on a container load from Singapore on this garbage and are likely protected by the insurance from the credit card, do I say anything or keep my mouth shut? Name Withheld

Although the sale of actual antiques can sometimes involve ethical and legal complexities, this is basically a case of misrepresented merchandise. Your friends would probably be embarrassed by what you have to tell them; you’ll want to be diplomatic. But you would want to be alerted if you’d been taken, and you should alert your friends while the fraud is fresh. Besides the specific protections their credit card might offer, it’s worth bearing in mind that Singapore takes pride in its legal system, and its authorities will investigate such charges. If your friendship with the couple is genuine, you’ll share your concern that their acquisitions aren’t.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“It’s an act of defiance, an act of resistance, really,” he said in a telephone interview. “We live in a climate of fear which is the very situation where these voices need to be voiced to be able to provide strength to those who are still scared in the situation”

Mr. Alam was released on bail in November after 107 days of imprisonment. But since the charges have not been dropped, he potentially faces 7 to 14 years in prison under a law that lets the government arrest people who criticize it online.

Despite his release, it has been a struggle to put on the festival, which opened this week. All but one of the local corporate sponsors withdrew, while public museums and other venues used in previous festivals became unavailable. But Mr. Alam and his team “improvised and by the skin of our teeth put together a program which has turned out to be the best festival we’ve had,” he said.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Created by the company and directed by Michael Levinton, who is also in the cast, “Skinnamarink” was inspired by McGuffey’s Eclectic Readers, textbooks that were first published in 1836 and remained wildly popular until the early 20th century. Paralleling the books’ blend of pedagogy and moralizing, the show constantly plays off the double meaning of the word “instruction” — a schooling process but also a disciplinary tool. Groupthink is encouraged and whoever gets the dunce cap is shamed: “No one loves a bad boy. No one can love those who are bad.”

The children follow orders piped out from a speaker as a disembodied voice of authority (Kate Weber) leads the class through rote learning, cryptic drills and petty humiliations, all seasoned with a pinch of grotesque. At one point the students put on mouth retractors, making them look as if they are visiting a dentist in the darkly satirical series “Black Mirror.”

As always, Little Lord, which describes its shows as “junk spectaculars,” practices an open-source approach. While much of the material, like a cautionary tale about a “greedy girl,” is lifted from the Eclectic Readers, the company’s magpie M.O. provides leeway to incorporate, say, a poem about Jack Frost (“Who hath killed the pretty flowers/Born and bred in summer bowers?”) or lines from V.C. Andrews’ “Flowers in the Attic” (“If I ever catch boys and girls using the facilities at the same time, I will quite relentlessly, and without mercy, peel the skins from your backs”).

These disparate borrowings are integrated into a bewildering whole that is much tighter than Little Lord’s chaotically sprawling previous production, “Now Is the Time. Now Is the Best Time. Now Is the Best Time of Your Life.” Even the titles reflect the difference, with three short sentences replaced by a single word — which refers to an old singalong that became a staple of the Canadian trio Sharon, Lois &amp; Bram’s repertoire.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>LONDON — Her cabinet is split and her party is at war, but Britain’s prime minister, Theresa May, recently found time to get out and about, and says she heard a clear message from a weary public.

“They want to see this resolved,” Mrs. May told Parliament, referring to the tortuous, tedious, yet momentous task of withdrawing from the European Union, a process known as Brexit.

If so, the British are in for a disappointment. Not only is the Brexit process really just starting, in some respects it might never end.

On Tuesday, lawmakers are scheduled to vote on Mrs. May’s two-part plan for Britain’s departure: a legally binding agreement laying down divorce terms from the bloc, and a much vaguer declaration on future ties. If they defeat it, as many expect, they will be back to square one and, in all likelihood, pleading for an extension from the European Union that could last anything from a couple of months to a couple of years.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>SAN FRANCISCO — Pinterest is preparing for its debut on Wall Street with a claim that few other “unicorn” start-ups can make: It is not a financial sinkhole.

While the company is unprofitable, according to an offering prospectus made public on Friday, its losses are nowhere near as high as those of other well-known start-ups like Uber and Lyft, which are also getting ready to list their shares. That makes Pinterest — which lets people create digital “pin boards” — one of the rarer unicorns, a term applied to start-ups valued at more than $1 billion by private market investors.

The deep losses afflicting many high-profile start-ups have cast investor doubts on the herd of companies that are stampeding toward the public market. Lyft recently revealed that it lost $911.3 million last year. Uber previously disclosed that it lost $842 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 alone. PagerDuty, a software start-up valued at $1.3 billion that also filed to go public this week, said in its prospectus that it was losing money. Only Zoom, a video conferencing company last valued at $1 billion, showed that it was making money, in an offering prospectus it filed on Friday.

Pinterest’s filing reported that the company had lost $63 million in 2018. But that was much narrower than a year earlier, when it lost $138 million.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>His trial, followed by the three years of appeals, was the most important in the 23-year history of the United Nations tribunal, and was widely seen as a test of whether the modern international criminal justice system could impose accountability on wartime leaders.

The proceedings thoroughly investigated the bloodiest conflict in Europe since World War II, which tore apart Yugoslavia, ravaged several of the smaller nations that emerged from it and left more than 100,000 people dead. Among the Balkan combatants — Serbia, Bosnia, Kosovo and Croatia — millions of people were displaced, many of them forced from their homes in campaigns of ethnic cleansing.

The tribunal has tried many figures for crimes in the wars that broke up Yugoslavia. Mr. Karadzic and Gen. Ratko Mladic, the former Bosnian Serb commander, are the most senior figures to be convicted. Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president whose extreme nationalism instigated and enabled the bloody conflict, died in 2006 in his cell in The Hague before the end of his trial.

The genocide conviction of Mr. Karadzic dealt with the Srebrenica massacre, when 8,000 Bosnians, mostly men and boys, were rounded up and systematically murdered.

Members of the Mothers of Srebrenica, an organization of survivors of Srebrenica and a nearby village, Zepa, were present at The Hague on Wednesday.

At the Potocari Memorial Center, close to the scene of the Srebrenica massacre, local residents, including relatives of the victims, gathered to watch the tribunal’s result through an online video stream.

The appeals were little covered by the news media in Serbia, where The Hague’s tribunal is widely viewed as anti-Serb and many Serbs see Mr. Karadzic as a hero.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“This is him spinning the proclamation into more than it is,” said Ofer Zalzberg of the International Crisis Group. “If Israel annexed Gush Etzion, would Trump let it lie? He could decide that the Golan was desirable, but the West Bank is not. He did not commit to recognizing all Israeli annexation. Trump never said he was going to be consistent.”

Even legal experts who are sympathetic to Israeli claims in the West Bank and East Jerusalem stressed the differences between those territories and the Golan.

“It can’t serve as a precedent,” said Alan Baker, a retired Israeli diplomat and former legal adviser to the Israeli Foreign Ministry who lives in a West Bank settlement. “Every situation has its own specific aspects.”

Mr. Baker, co-author of a 2012 government report that argued that the West Bank was not occupied and that the Israeli settlements there are legal, said one of the main differences between it and the Golan was that under the Oslo Accords of the 1990s, both the Israelis and Palestinians committed to determining the future status of the West Bank through negotiations.

“According to international law,” he said, “you can’t acquire territory, annex or take sovereignty as an act of war, only as part of a negotiation and with the agreement of the former sovereign. That’s the normal practice.”

But he added that “if a state is exercising the right of self-defense against an aggressor, then the defending state is permitted to remain as long as the threat exists and as long as the other state presents a danger.”

Since 1948, Mr. Baker said, Syria has threatened Israel. Today it is also unstable and has used chemical warfare against its citizens, and its president has been accused of committing war crimes. Syria has consistently refused to recognize Israel, or a common border with Israel.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>While all of this was going on, the Supreme Court was in the midst of a revolution in its own jurisprudence, recognizing a constitutional right on the part even of indigent criminal defendants to pursue appeals of their convictions and sentences, and invigorating a raft of new substantive constitutional protections that could be invoked in such appeals. Finally, in 1983, Congress tied these two threads together, giving the Supreme Court direct appellate jurisdiction, for the first time, over the military justice system.

But Congress limited the Supreme Court’s power over courts-martial to those cases that had been heard by the Court of Military Appeals — which, like the Supreme Court, generally has the power to pick and choose which cases it hears. Last year, for example, that court (now known as the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces) heard arguments and handed down opinions in just 35 of the 360 petitions for review that it received.

If it were clear that the military appeals court agreed to hear every case that might potentially be worthy of the Supreme Court’s review, that would be one thing. But a 2016 study by a military lawyer found that most of what the court did was to correct case-specific errors that don’t broadly affect the military justice system, while denying review to cases that could . Earlier this month, the military appeals court turned away an Army staff sergeant’s request to summarily affirm his conviction (rather than deny review) so he could take his case to the Supreme Court. His case turned on whether his lack of access to potentially exculpatory evidence would require a new trial, a question that has divided the federal courts of appeals.

Worse still, the government routinely takes the position that the Supreme Court can review only the specific issues the military appeals court decides, and not the entire case it hears. Last month, for example, the Supreme Court declined to hear a case challenging whether the Constitution allows the military to court-martial military retirees for offenses committed after leaving active duty. The government had argued that, even though the military appeals court had agreed to hear the case, the Supreme Court could not review it because the military court had not agreed to consider that specific issue.

The result of these developments is that only a tiny minority of service members convicted by court-martial are entitled to appeal their conviction to the Supreme Court. In that regard, service members are not only treated worse than every other criminal defendant in state and federal courts, they’re also treated worse than the noncitizen enemy combatants being tried at Guantánamo. Under the Military Commissions Act of 2009, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the self-described architect of the Sept. 11 attacks, and his fellow military commission defendants have a statutory right to appeal any conviction not just to the civilian courts, but ultimately to seek review by the justices themselves.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“If you’re going to be buying real estate on Sanibel Island, you’ve already bought into the environmental side of things and you probably already get it,” said Kyle Sweet, the superintendent at the Sanctuary Golf Club, the island’s only private course.

Mr. Sweet not only maintains his course to Audubon International standards, but he also is guided by the wildlife refuge, as well as by rigid city requirements. Water quality and chemical nutrient loads are regularly monitored and the city issues an annual grade.

Even residences are regulated in regard to impermeable surfaces, such as driveways. The Sanctuary has removed more than a mile and a half of concrete cart paths from the course.

The course has also converted to hardier, salt-tolerant turf grass and upgraded its irrigation system for a 30 percent savings in water use.

“We have a lot of members who are on the board at the Sanibel-Captiva Conservation Foundation and Ding Darling National Wildlife Refuge,” said Kathryn Riggio, the membership coordinator at the Sanctuary. “They are very invested in our environmental responsibility.”

After Dr. Wendy Kindig, a Sanctuary resident and golf club member, retired from her clinical nephrology practice, she got involved in enviromental efforts at the Sanctuary, as well as on the board of the “Ding” Darling Wildlife Society.

“Conservation is pretty ingrained in this community,” she said.</TEXT>

The CBS fantasy-mystery “God Friended Me” rented computers that were cutting-edge machines in the now-ancient era of 15 or 20 years ago. The Netflix prison drama “Orange Is the New Black” also found obsolete computers, and a Canadian program called “Vintage Tech Hunters” located the particular PlayStation video game console from the 1990s that it had been hunting for.

A blocky recycling-center warehouse in Brooklyn has become a go-to destination for producers and set decorators searching for computers that have been swept into the dustbin of tech history. The warehouse has a prop shop that provides an afterlife for old electronic devices, renting them to movie and television studios when scripts call for a period look.

“It’s a wonderful and weird back-room gold mine if you know what you’re looking for,” said David Lerech, an executive producer of “Vintage Tech Hunters.” “You get some diamonds in the rough if you search through the place. There’s stuff of real value — you just have to know what you’re looking for.”

All of it was brought in by the original owners, who probably figured it would be recycled, with the plastic cases, circuit boards and components separated to be crushed or melted, and used again.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Many Times articles and columns discuss how the Trump-Fox ticket ardently hopes that 2020 will be a binary contest between socialism and capitalism/freedom.

Rejecting that hoary choice is Senator Elizabeth Warren. Her “regulated markets” alternative instead presumes that, when competition fails to protect families, it’s better to build guard rails at the top of a cliff than put ambulances below. This means not freedom to inflict harm (pollute, monopolize) but freedom from harm ( climate violence, financial fraud, unsafe products).

Given the corrosive surge in income inequality, Senator Warren has proposed new structural changes reminiscent of how F.D.R.’s New Deal in the 1930s pledged “to save capitalism from itself.” They include an ultramillionaires’ wealth tax and a proposal to break up tech giants that are digitally stifling small businesses and economic opportunity.

Socialism? These bold proposals seek to expand competition and freedom, not government ownership.

The 2020 contest will be between democracy and piracy. Here, it’s the G.O.P. that is extreme while Democrats are mainstream.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Federal elections officials have fined Ted Cruz’s Senate campaign $35,000 for failing to report more than $1 million in bank loans he used to finance his successful long-shot race in Texas in 2012.

The penalty was part of a settlement reached by the Federal Election Commission and Mr. Cruz’s Senate campaign in February and disclosed in a letter this week from the commission to the Campaign Legal Center, a watchdog group that had filed a complaint over the unreported loans.

The fine comes more than three years after the loans were revealed by The New York Times in January 2016 and became a political issue for Mr. Cruz during the Republican presidential primary. The Times article showed how Mr. Cruz claimed to have liquidated his family’s wealth and put it into his 2012 campaign, when in fact he had borrowed money from Goldman Sachs and Citibank without disclosing it on campaign filings.

Mr. Cruz initially described his actions as a clerical oversight, saying he had disclosed the loans on a different set of reports, filed with the Senate, that detailed his personal income, assets and debts. But those reports did not explain what the loans were used for, and he failed to disclose them, as required, on filings with the election commission, which would have showed the $1,064,000 from the two banks was used for campaign purposes.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Ricardo Guadalupe, the chief executive of Hublot, said he looked beyond the watch world to create interesting pieces.

After all, he said, “You can read the time everywhere now — we have to go beyond that.”

So the house has collaborated with the singer Nicky Jam to celebrate reggaeton, the Latin-Caribbean hip-hop music scene, with a line of skeletonized, gold-plated watches.

The 45-millimeter Hublot Big Bang Meca-10 Nicky Jam King Gold features a bezel of 48 baguette-cut gems — 16 orange sapphires, 16 yellow sapphires and 16 tsavorites — which are the same colors seen in the singer’s music video “X (Equis).”

“Everybody can use diamonds,” Mr. Guadalupe said. “But when you use a different approach — working with the aesthetic of the gems — it’s interesting.”

For its debut women’s watch collection, the avant-garde house RJ (once known as Romain Jerome) wasn’t satisfied with colored gem-set bezels alone. Its new Arraw Star Twist also features a mechanism that spins the bezel — and, when coupled with the kind of sapphire, topaz and amethyst mix on one model — the effect is striking.</TEXT>

Stephen Colbert returned from a weeklong break on Monday and dove into a takedown of President Trump’s rambling speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Saturday.

It was a historically long speech — but its most memorable moment may have come at the very beginning, when Trump shared a long, very tender embrace with an American flag onstage.

“He talked for two hours and two minutes, making it ‘the longest presidential oration in American history.’ Which is impressive, because some of Obama’s pauses were almost an hour.” — STEPHEN COLBERT, quoting from an article in The Atlantic “He is dry humping Old Glory! I believe that is the first time a flag has ever volunteered to be burned. Just full Kevorkian.” — STEPHEN COLBERT</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Q: I recently bought an apartment in a new condo, and it has had persistent plumbing problems. For example, the water takes at least four minutes to heat up to lukewarm. When I complain about the water, management says they’ll send an engineer to look, but nothing improves. Other residents have experienced similar issues. The management and the sponsor of the development are big companies, so even though I own the apartment, I feel powerless. What’s the best way to get these problems fixed?

A: Problems have a way of cropping up in any new apartment. But with new construction, it’s often much harder to see those problems coming: If you’re the first person to turn on the faucet, you’ll be the first to notice something wrong with it.

Now that you’ve noticed the problems, they need to be addressed. The condo association, not the unit owner, is responsible for maintaining common elements like pipes in the walls. So it should fix what’s broken.

In a new building, the sponsor of the development usually controls the board for a period of time, appointing members. The board has a fiduciary duty to protect the interests of the unit owners. However, the sponsor-appointed members may not be motivated to fix problems that expose defects in the construction of the building, because they would have to dig into their own coffers to address them.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>That too many other numbers disappoint is a problem not just with the choreography but also with the overall staging, which by the middle of the second act seems to run out of invention. In the song “Bianca,” Mr. Bleu executes amazing calisthenic feats (at one point he tap dances upside-down beneath a stair landing), but the big picture gets lost. The wit of Bianca’s “Always True to You in My Fashion” disappears amid too much stage business. And “Brush Up Your Shakespeare,” usually a double-entendre showstopper for two comic gangsters (John Pankow and Lance Coadie Williams), just slows the show down instead.

John Guare’s 1999 script revisions, retained here, don’t help. That production bumped up the role of Harrison Howell, Lilli’s fiancé, from vague Southern gentleman to MacArthur-like general. Meant to highlight Lilli’s choice between safe conformity and difficult freedom, the character still feels as shoehorned as the Porter standard (“From This Moment On”) interpolated for him to sing.

But the revisions made for the current production are more sensitively achieved. In the simplest, a framing device invoking the ghostliness of the empty stage establishes the show as a theatrical throwback. The biggest comes at the end, when the lyrics to Kate’s song “I Am Ashamed That Women Are So Simple,” which Porter largely lifted from Shakespeare, get a heavy reworking. (Amanda Green is credited with “additional material.”) Now it’s “people” who are so simple, and not just women but all lovers who must learn subservience.

Purists may squawk — though similar changes have long since shown up in feminist productions of “The Taming of the Shrew.” For me, the adjustments, especially Ms. Green’s and Ms. O’Hara’s, are completely successful. They not only reorient the story as a warning to all sexes, but also provide a workaround for a musical that our cancel culture seemed ready to throw on the bonfire of the inanities.

How nice to find “Kiss Me, Kate” rescued from that fate: still speaking to us — or better yet, singing — from the not so buried past.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>When R. Kelly was arrested on child pornography charges in 2002, Lanita Carter, his hairdresser, was one of his staunchest defenders.

She told people that he was a perfect gentleman, that they should pray for him, that he was “nothing like what they say.”

Ms. Carter’s vision of Mr. Kelly was destroyed one day in February 2003, when Carter, then 24, said she was summoned to braid the singer’s hair. Once they were alone, she said, Mr. Kelly asked for a head massage. She told him she did not do massages. But then, she said, the singer pulled her head down by her braid, and demanded oral sex. She refused, and said he began masturbating and spitting on her face. She remembered vividly how much he spat.

“Six times,” Ms. Carter said, during an emotional interview that aired Thursday on “CBS This Morning.” Mr. Kelly only stopped, she said, when someone knocked on the door. “Fix your face,” she said he hissed at her, twice.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>52A: They aren’t the same, but your “time machine” has enough letters in common with your TELEPORTING that you could definitely ruin the bottom of your grid for a little while.

4D: This clue looked cryptic, and it’s enough in that vein to be unusual — three “T”s in a row, a series of TRUES I guess.

7D: If you’re a rosé lover you may have noticed BLUSH WINES in wine stores or restaurants (I am far more used to seeing rosé on a menu these days but “blush” definitely rang a bell). Blush is a comparatively recent creation in the history of wine and apparently was used primarily as a descriptor for White Zinfandel, which was a byproduct of an attempt to create a richer version of standard (red) Zinfandel wine back in the 1970s.

21D: I think of New York City as rolling in pugs, but I just learned that they’re not even in our top 10 (perhaps I’ve been lumping them in with Frenchies all this time because of their similarly stertorous respiration style). Anyhow, the pugs I know are sort of like basketballs with legs in stature, so I don’t think of them as TOY DOGS, but that is the group that they show in.

When I started constructing, very few grids used left-right symmetry. The only explanation I can think of is tradition — to me, left-right symmetry is just as elegant as rotational symmetry, and it also makes many otherwise-impossible themes doable. Left-right symmetry feels especially underutilized in themelesses, so I decided to try my hand at a 62-worder with a pattern I (unsurprisingly) hadn’t seen before. I started with DISTRESSED DENIM, a lively 15 whose middle letters seemed very friendly for a bottom stack. When constructing, I always tackle the most open sections first, since they tend to have the most constraints. My construction flow thus proceeded from the middle to the bottom to the upper left (where I needed 7-letter entries ending in the unfriendly letters B and U) to the upper right. I hope you enjoy this crunchy Saturday!

Other critics said it was “extraordinary inside and out, ” or, simply, “astonishing.”

The National Museum of Qatar — the kingdom’s latest mega-project — opened to the public on Thursday. The museum tells the story of Qatar, from prehistoric times to the present day, including ongoing political events such as the blockade imposed by Saudi Arabia and other neighbors. But it will get most attention for its architecture.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The most dangerous thing a woman can possess is self-worth. Liking her own body, trusting her own instincts, valuing her own time and company, thinking she’s interesting and special, entering business and personal relationships based only on mutual benefit and respect. Sometimes this leads to advertisers having no idea how to corner us. If we don’t hate ourselves, how will we know what to buy? Sometimes self-worth leads to violence against us.

Sometimes, though, self-worth sets us free.

“Shrill” is a show where that happens, and it’s lovely.

Aidy Bryant stars as Annie, a writer in Portland, Ore., who’s stuck — stuck editing calendar listings at an alt-weekly; stuck dating a beardo dingus who treats her shabbily; stuck with the tedious ticker of society constantly running in her mind, telling her she’s bad and gross and lazy and worthless because she is fat.

Annie’s not an apology of a human being, which fat people and women and especially fat women are taught to be, nor does she spend every second of the day in despair. But by the time we meet her, she’s just about at the end of her rope. She’s sharp enough to joke that the man she’s sleeping with, Ryan (Luka Jones), is “like a disrespectful baby, but a man who knows better” — but she makes this joke to his mother, whom she meets in his kitchen, when his mom comes over to make breakfast and drop off his laundry.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>SANTA ANA, Calif. — Nearly two months after a federal jury decided that a notorious motorcycle club must forfeit the rights to its trademarked emblem, a judge on Thursday nullified the verdict, finding that seizure of the intellectual property was unconstitutional.

In a 51-page ruling, Federal District Judge David O. Carter said the government’s strategy of trying to devastate the Mongols motorcycle club by confiscating its treasured Genghis Khan-style logo would violate the group’s First Amendment right to free speech and the excessive fines clause of the Eighth Amendment.

The decision upended years of efforts by prosecutors to weaken the Mongols, which a federal jury in January deemed a criminal enterprise after finding the group guilty of racketeering and racketeering conspiracy for the crimes of murder, attempted murder and drug dealing. In the second phase of that wide-ranging, eight-week trial, the jury found that the Mongols must give up their rights to the emblem, which is emblazoned on the vests, T-shirts and motorcycles of hundreds of members.

But Judge Carter declined to order the Mongols to forfeit the logo until he had a chance to review their arguments and consider their free speech rights.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>What we need is not to disagree less, but to disagree better. And that starts when you turn away the rhetorical dope peddlers — the powerful people on your own side who are profiting from the culture of contempt. As satisfying as it can feel to hear that your foes are irredeemable, stupid and deviant, remember: When you find yourself hating something, someone is making money or winning elections or getting more famous and powerful. Unless a leader is actually teaching you something you didn’t know or expanding your worldview and moral outlook, you are being used.

Next, each of us can make a commitment never to treat others with contempt, even if we believe they deserve it. This might sound like a call for magnanimity, but it is just as much an appeal to self-interest. Contempt makes persuasion impossible — no one has ever been hated into agreement, after all — so its expression is either petty self-indulgence or cheap virtue signaling, neither of which wins converts.

What if you have been guilty of saying contemptuous things about or to others? Perhaps you have hurt someone with your harsh words, mockery or dismissiveness. I have, and I’m not proud of it. Start the road to recovery from this harmful addiction, and make amends wherever possible. It will set you free.

Finally, we should see the contempt around us as what it truly is: an opportunity, not a threat. If you are on social media, on a college campus or in any place other than a cave by yourself, you will be treated with contempt very soon. This is a chance to change at least one heart — yours. Respond with warmheartedness and good humor. You are guaranteed to be happier. If that also affects the contemptuous person (or bystanders), it will be to the good.

It is easy to feel helpless in the current political environment, but I believe that is unwarranted. While we might not like the current weather, together we can change the climate to reward leaders — and be the leaders — who uplift and unite, not denigrate and divide. Watch: The weather will start to improve, and that will make America greater. I am dedicating the rest of my professional life to this task.

Mr. Brooks is president of the American Enterprise Institute and author of the forthcoming book “Love Your Enemies: How Decent People Can Save America From the Culture of Contempt,” from which this essay is adapted.

      <TEXT>And yet, it’s hard to see how places like New Zealand can ever feel safe without some changes internationally. “We need to understand American laws because they affect us,” one commentator said on Radio New Zealand this week.

Indeed the lack of legislative effort by American lawmakers on the issues that helped spawn the Christchurch attack — guns, racism and tech platforms — is no longer just a frustration in the United States. Now it wounds the world.

There’s hard work to be done for that to change. The solution is not praying for victims or praising Ms. Ardern on Twitter. What New Zealanders want is for Americans to learn from others, for globalization to go the other way, even if it means limitations on fundamental U.S. of A. freedoms.

On guns, countries like New Zealand have less to confront: Of the 3.9 million New Zealanders of gun-licensing age, 238,000 — just 6 percent — have a firearm license, according to the website GunPolicy.org. In the United States, three in 10 adults say they own a firearm.

Tech companies are another challenge. Despite a growing body of research showing that the algorithms of YouTube, Facebook and other social media platforms push people further into violent extremism, getting those companies and their employees to dial back their self-regard and shift their priorities may be as hard as persuading gun owners to give up their AR-15s.

And let’s be honest: Those are the easy things to fix compared with racism and white supremacy.

Some Muslims in Christchurch are hoping that the unity of the community and New Zealand officials will set a new standard.

“If we can use what happened here to say enough is enough, if we can promote what we call in New Zealand ‘aroha,’” said Mustafa Farouk, president of the Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand, using the Maori word for love, “maybe the people behind these shootings will change.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“We were persuaded their science was sound,” he said.

Mr. Deakin had to drop the charges against Mr. McNair to make time for the test. After three months, the Eurofins team came back with a conclusion: DNA samples from the rapes matched Dwayne McNair, not Dwight.

Based on a statistical analysis by Dr. Krawczak, Mr. Deaking told the court that it was two billion times more likely that the rapist's DNA belonged to Dwayne McNair than to his brother.

Armed with the new results, Mr. Deakin re-indicted Mr. McNair in September 2014. His lawyers filed a motion to exclude the Eurofins test from evidence. They argued that it was too new and too little studied to be reliable.

After hearing expert witnesses for both sides, Judge Linda Giles ruled that the test was based on valid scientific principles. But it had yet to be replicated by any other lab or to be laid out in sufficient detail in a peer-reviewed journal article.

“Although the court has the utmost respect for the ability of jurors to comprehend complicated scientific principles, they would not have the luxury of many days of rumination, as this gatekeeper has needed, to untie this Gordian knot,” she wrote in a decision handed down in April 2017.

“So we were out of luck and back where we started,” said Mr. Deakin.

The decision was not just a disappointment to Mr. Deakin. Prosecutors in Michigan had been considering using the technique to distinguish between the twins in the Grand Rapids rape case. Now they decided against it.

In Boston, the case continued, with a conventional DNA test narrowing the suspects to the twins and the testimony of Mr. Thomas specifically against Dwayne McNair.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>[Read how Mr. Manafort’s sentence compares to other white-collar criminals.]

Judge Jackson tends to be relatively lenient on convicted criminals who appear before her. In the five years that ended in 2017, she handed down an average prison sentence of 32 months, below the Washington district’s average of 46 months and the nationwide average of 47 months, according to court data maintained by Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.

But she also has gone out of her way to make clear that being well connected earns no chits in her court. “She knows who commits white-collar crime,” said Heather Shaner, a Washington lawyer who represented an embezzler in her court. “And she thinks it’s perfectly fine to punish them if they commit a crime and hold them to a higher standard because they have the education, and because they have the wealth.”

The prospect that Mr. Trump could pardon Mr. Manafort has hung over the proceedings for many months. Late last year, Mr. Trump said that he “wouldn’t take it off the table.” More recently, he said, “I don’t even discuss it.”

Asked again after Wednesday’s sentencing, Mr. Trump said: “I have not even given it a thought, as of this moment. It’s not something that’s right now on my mind.” He added, “I feel very badly for Paul Manafort,” saying “certainly, on a human basis, it’s a very sad thing.”

He said again that the special counsel’s investigation was “a hoax.” In remarks that appeared aimed at the president, Mr. Downing said outside the courthouse that “two courts have ruled no evidence of any collusion with the Russians.”

In fact, Judge Jackson and Judge Ellis simply noted that the evidence against Mr. Manafort was not related to Russia’s election meddling.

The new charges filed in New York, in an indictment secured by the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., were apparently meant to ensure that Mr. Manafort would be punished even if he was pardoned. They were rooted in the same financial fraud that led to Mr. Manafort’s downfall in federal courthouses. He is charged with falsifying business records to obtain millions of dollars in loans from two banks.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Contrary to his public statements, Trump pursued business in Russia deep into the presidential race.

Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to another charge: lying to Congress about how long Mr. Trump pursued a real estate project in Russia during 2016. His plea demonstrated that Mr. Trump had continued to negotiate over a proposed Trump Tower Moscow deep into the campaign — even as he publicly encouraged the Russians to hack Mrs. Clinton’s emails and the Kremlin kept up its effort to help his campaign.

As the investigations around Mr. Trump intensified at the end of the year, he tried a familiar tactic: He asked his acting attorney general to try to exert more control over the investigations related to Mr. Cohen.

In January, Mr. Mueller continued his pursuit of those around Mr. Trump, indicting the president’s longtime adviser, Roger Stone, on charges of lying to Congress about his contacts with WikiLeaks during the campaign. The indictment contained a curious detail. It said that a senior campaign official “was directed” by an unnamed person to have Mr. Stone inquire from WikiLeaks about the future release of material damaging to Mrs. Clinton.
• None Prosecutors Effectively Accuse Trump of Defrauding Voters. What Does It Mean?

Cohen raises the possibility of additional criminal liability for Trump.

In a daylong appearance before the House Oversight Committee, Mr. Cohen turned on the boss he had once said he would “take a bullet” to protect. He said he had only “suspicions” of a Trump-Russia connection but laid out evidence of a range of possible crimes with no Russian connection.

He displayed a check signed by the president, he said was to reimburse him for hush money payments, that could implicate Mr. Trump in a campaign finance violation. He described how Mr. Trump inflated and deflated the value of his assets to get loans or reduce taxes, actions that could amount to bank fraud, insurance fraud and tax evasion. He said Mr. Trump had indicated, without directly instructing him, that he should lie to Congress. He described how Mr. Trump had used his charity to purchase a portrait of himself, in evident violation of state laws governing charitable foundations.
• None Michael Cohen Accuses Trump of Expansive Pattern of Lies and Criminality
• None Testimony From Cohen Could Compound Legal Issues for Trump

Mr. Mueller delivered a lengthy report to Attorney General William P. Barr last month. Two days later, Mr. Barr announced that Mr. Mueller “did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with&quot; Russia.

A more clouded picture emerged on the question of whether Mr. Trump illegally obstructed justice. Mr. Barr said that Mr. Mueller declined to determine whether Mr. Trump broke the law but also pointedly did not exonerate him. Mr. Barr said that left it to him to make the judgment, and that he and Mr. Rosenstein concluded that Mr. Trump had not violated the law. But some of the special counsel’s investigators told associates that Mr. Barr failed to adequately portray their findings and that they were more troubling for Mr. Trump than his attorney general indicated.
• None Mueller Finds No Trump-Russia Conspiracy, but Stops Short of Exonerating President on Obstruction
• None Some on Mueller’s Team Say Report Was More Damaging Than Barr Revealed

If Mr. Mueller portrays Mr. Trump as intent on using his power to protect himself and his associates from an investigation, the revelations could prompt Democrats to expand their investigations into the president and even consider impeachment. But if the report simply summarizes what is already known, it could embolden Mr. Trump, who has already begun calling for scrutiny of the investigation’s origins.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Even its title vibrates vertiginously with layers of meaning. Most literally, “White Noise,” Suzan-Lori Parks’s enthrallingly thought-packed new play at the Public Theater, refers to the whoosh generated by those much-used, soothing sound makers designed to lull people to sleep.

Such a device, we learn early in this astringent and eloquent work from the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning “Topdog/Underdog,” was a gift to an insomniac in his 30s named Leo (a smashing Daveed Diggs), who hasn’t had a good night’s rest since he was 5.

It worked. It also backfired, to the point that this anxious young artist stopped making art. Blessed unconsciousness, it appears, is not a state that Leo can afford to be in it right now.

Nor, it seems, can any American, not when it comes to dealing with people of other skin colors. That’s true even — no, especially — of those who pride themselves on their comfort with interracial relationships. Like the two couples at the center of Ms. Parks’s play, which opened on Wednesday and has been directed with a radiant clarity by Oskar Eustis.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>When Ricky Gervais comes out with a new project, the big question is: Which one of him made it? There’s Bad Ricky, the smirking cynic who revels in shock and insult and “Sorry, did I offend you?” And there’s Saint Ricky, the sentimentalist sad clown, who favors pathos and big emotional windups set to Cat Stevens.

“The Office,” a lacerating cringe comedy with a humane spirit, synthesized Gervais’s two sides into greatness. Since then, he’s intensified in both directions, but separately.

In his standup comedy and public appearances, he plays the anti-P.C. truth teller, saying what (he thinks) everyone thinks. In his TV series, he’s indulged his squishy side, a little in “Extras,” and a lot in the maudlin “Derek,” in which he played a beatific, childlike nursing-home worker.

The two Gervaises — the angel and devil sitting on his own shoulders — uneasily swap custody of “After Life,” which arrives on Netflix on Friday. The dark comedy’s six episodes, all of which Gervais wrote and directed, whiplash between vicious and mawkish. It’s the TV equivalent of making lemonade by alternating swigs of straight lemon juice and corn syrup.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>In an email sent the day Mr. Giuliani was named as Mr. Trump’s lawyer, Mr. Costello told Mr. Cohen, “I am sure you saw the news that Rudy is joining the Trump legal team.” He added that he had told Mr. Cohen about his “relationship with Rudy, which could be very very useful for you.” Mr. Cohen wrote back, in part saying, “Great news.”

Within a day, Mr. Costello spoke by phone with Mr. Giuliani to tell him that Mr. Cohen was planning to hire Mr. Costello’s law firm. Soon after that call, Mr. Costello emailed Mr. Cohen to say, “Rudy was thrilled and said this could not be a better situation for the President or you,” noting that Mr. Giuliani knew and trusted Mr. Costello. Mr. Giuliani, he added, “said thank you for opening this back channel of communication.”

Later the same weekend, Mr. Costello sent the email about “friends in high places.” Those two emails were first reported by CNN.

The Times reported last week that Mr. Cohen had described to the prosecutors how Mr. Costello had spoken with Mr. Giuliani. Mr. Costello declined to comment at the time, citing attorney-client privilege, but has since learned that Mr. Cohen waived the privilege, freeing him to discuss his experience with Mr. Cohen.

In the interview, Mr. Costello accused Mr. Cohen of smearing him to the prosecutors as part of a bid to reduce his sentence. He also said that Mr. Cohen repeatedly told him that he had committed no crimes and misled Mr. Costello’s law firm about his intentions to hire them.

“Cohen lied to us from day one,” Mr. Costello said, adding that neither he nor Mr. Giuliani dangled a pardon in front of Mr. Cohen.

A lawyer for Mr. Cohen, Lanny J. Davis, said he could not comment on the documents requested by prosecutors, but suggested it was “impossible to deny or try to spin your way out of what documents say.” He added that Mr. Cohen had clarified his testimony about pardons in a letter to the House committee this week, and that Mr. Cohen stood by his statement to the committee about not having sought a pardon. Mr. Davis said after the testimony that Mr. Cohen had inquired about Mr. Trump’s intentions after the president’s legal team “dangled” the possibility of pardons.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>ARCADIA, Calif. — The mood was tense on Friday at Santa Anita Park, one of the grandest venues in horse racing, as the usually mellow track in Los Angeles County reopened after a nearly monthlong shutdown. Twenty-two horses had died on the grounds over 11 weeks.

“It’s a little different vibe,” Joe Locke said while sitting alongside his wife, Sandy. They are horse owners from Houston.

There was relief after it was over: All the horses survived.

On the morning of March 14, a garden-variety filly named Princess Lili B crossed the finish line of a half-mile workout at the track and collapsed with two broken forelegs. She had previously competed twice, placing fifth and ninth, in the lowest rungs of racing at majestic Santa Anita and earned $1,345, barely enough to cover expenses.

The track had already been closed to racing for two weeks when Princess Lili B became the 22nd thoroughbred fatality since the winter meet began on Dec. 26, helping push racing toward a painful self-examination and contentious reform.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Sometimes the solution to improving student attendance can be as simple as offering an alarm clock, a bus token or a free breakfast. For schools in Kentucky, Missouri, New Jersey, Colorado and elsewhere across the country, especially those serving low-income populations, the answer is a washing machine.

“If it’s a choice between coming to school dirty, and have kids laugh at you or make fun of you, and staying home, they’ll stay home,” said Rebecca Nicolas, the principal at Fern Creek High School in Louisville, Ky., where almost 70 percent of students qualify for subsidized or free lunches.

This month, the school opened a “Laundry and Loot” room, where students can bring their clothes to be washed, and also pick up donated items such as socks and deodorant.

All 1,750 students are eligible to participate, and teachers and counselors are recruiting students to bring their laundry to school.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Thank you, Mr. Brooks, for recognizing that the American racial divide is qualitatively different from our other troublesome divisions. It is “born out of sin” that “travels down society through the centuries.” Poll taxes and literacy tests for voting have long been outlawed, but racially motivated voting hurdles and gerrymandering greatly limit the political power of descendants of slaves.

“Separate but equal” was outlawed 65 years ago, but descendants of slaves still live in a separate and grossly unequal world, from education to neighborhoods, from health care to public services, from criminal justice to economic opportunity ... and so much more.

Of course there’s been progress. But it has taken superhuman effort, was yielded grudgingly at best, has often been reversed or subverted, and clearly never got to the root of the problem. Progress measured in centuries and in tenths of percentage points is an insult and a national disgrace.

So what are we to do if the legal, political and economic efforts have been so inadequate? That’s David Brooks’s point: We can’t truly cross the divide unless there’s a societywide and soul-deep acceptance of the sinfulness that has caused and perpetuated that divide. Only then can we find the political will to escape the legacy of slavery and move toward true racial justice.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>To get a sense of why this is happening, I talked to my colleague Emma G. Fitzsimmons, a transit reporter.

[Why New York’s lettered subway lines are “cursed.”]

How are the trains performing?

In 2017, less than 65 percent of trains were on time — the worst of any major transit system in the world, Ms. Fitzsimmons has reported. This year, that improved to 76 percent.

But there was a twist: The seven numbered trains were outperforming the 15 lettered trains. Seventy-nine percent of numbered trains were on time, compared with 68 percent of lettered trains.

Why are numbered trains doing better?
• Schedule changes on the numbered lines improved the on-time rate.
• A computer system on the numbered lines allows workers to more efficiently dispatch trains.
• The opening of the Second Avenue subway eased crowding on several numbered lines, and signal upgrades improved service on another numbered line.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>One of the oldest adages about college basketball is that guard play is the key to tournament success. Amid the intensity and mayhem that unfold each March, it is often the most composed, savvy and talented guards who determine the fates of their teams. But not always.

On Saturday, three of the best guards in the country showcased their skills in the N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament. One made the winning basket, another who is known for range could not make a 3-point shot, and perhaps the best guard of all probably played his last game in college.

Ja Morant, the singular talent from Murray State, hit his first five 3-point attempts and poured in 28 points, but the 12th-seeded Racers could not handle No. 4 Florida State as the Seminoles advanced to the round of 16 with a 90-62 victory in Hartford.

In Jacksonville, Fla., Tremont Waters of No. 3 Louisiana State, one of the most dynamic point guards in the country, pushed his team to victory against No. 6 Maryland.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>On Wednesday at the Park Avenue Armory, toward the end of a solo on sopranino saxophone that had lasted more than 10 minutes, Roscoe Mitchell made it seem as though the intimate dimensions of the Armory’s Veterans Room were in the process of being jackhammered.

After the solo’s gradual introductory section — full of rough-textured honks and droning harmonics — Mr. Mitchell started dispensing a stream of lightning-quick traditional notes, each one full of robust authority. And then, thanks to some gales of circular breathing, he managed to thread one of those earlier, overblown harmonics atop the ongoing, bebop-influenced flurry. This time the droning pitch was pealing, and ecstatically clear.

The room shook with the swelling overtones of amplified, electroacoustic music. But Mr. Mitchell’s funhouse was a fully acoustic one.

Then, switching back to his rougher extended-technique pitches, he once again sneaked in that liquid legato line of traditional notes, this time in a raspier style. The cumulative impact of this solo tour de force involved two different ways of looking at his polyphonic capability.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WASHINGTON — Rick Gates, the former top Trump campaign adviser who pleaded guilty to financial fraud crimes and lying to investigators, is still talking to federal prosecutors.

The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, requested for the fifth time on Friday a delay in the sentencing of Mr. Gates, a longtime political consultant who served as the campaign’s deputy and was indicted in a scheme related to work he did for a pro-Russian leader of Ukraine.

Mr. Gates “continues to cooperate with respect to several ongoing investigations,” Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors said in a joint status report.

Because the special counsel’s office cited other, unspecified inquiries, it was difficult to tell whether the petition for a delay in sentencing gave any indication of when its broader investigation into Russia’s election interference and possible ties to Trump associates would be complete, a subject of intense speculation.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>There are eerie resonances, too, in how Wotan and Alberich, opposing characters, become obsessed with the ring. Alberich literally stumbles upon the magic gold when he makes advances at the Rhinemaidens, who find him laughably hideous. Rebuffed and humiliated, he steals the gold in an I’ll-show-you-all act of vengeance. But Wotan, who has heard of the gold and its power, was content to leave it be, until the moment when we meet him in “Das Rheingold.” Now he needs to pay his contractors. And beyond that, once he learns what Alberich has done, Wotan feels threatened. He must get his hands on that ring, on that power — whatever the cost to his governing legitimacy and personal life.

You may also find one other theme uncomfortably familiar: heads of state near and far granting governing authority to family members. Having made a hash of things and violated the very codes he had sworn to uphold, Wotan must somehow make corrections. Knowing that his own hands are tied, he fathers children hoping that one of his descendants (perhaps the hero who has been prophesied) might take over his domain and, exercising free will, right his wrongs, while still maintaining power.

But it doesn’t look good. His narcissistic greed and power grabs have caused havoc in the world. The ring (now in possession of the giant Fafner) is cursed; the natural order has been disrupted; the only hope of averting the inevitable global calamity (which brings to mind climate change) is for the ring to be returned to the river.

Since Wotan also craves knowledge — knowledge is power, after all — he pursues Erda, the all-knowing earth goddess, who comes to warn him about what will ensue if he keeps on his heedless and destructive path. They end up having nine daughters together, and he raises the girls as Valkyrie warriors to do his bidding. But only Brünnhilde, his favorite, seems to know his mind. “Who am I if not your will?” she asks in an intimate moment when Wotan seems troubled. What follows is the rare confessional scene among numerous tales of fearsome, all-powerful fathers, when Wotan tells Brünnhilde the woeful story of how he has broken the covenants and mismanaged his life.

This aspect of the “Ring” always reminds me of the scene in “The Godfather” in which the ailing Vito Corleone confides in Michael, his trusted son. “I never wanted this for you,” Vito says. He had hoped that, after lawlessly building an empire, by this point he would have given the family business a legitimate veneer and groomed an heir who could prevail within the establishment. Senator Corleone? Governor Corleone? “We’ll get there, Pop,” Michael replies.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>There were balloons at Baylor, streamers at Missouri State and fake smiles at more colleges than anyone cared to count, but one thing was decidedly absent when the N.C.A.A. women’s basketball bracket was released on Monday: suspense.

For the second time in three years, a basketball tournament field leaked before it was supposed to be revealed on a selection show created specifically for that purpose. This time it was the bracket for the Division I women’s championship, which was supposed to be revealed at 7 p.m. Eastern on Monday on ESPN. Instead, ESPN’s sister network ESPNU accidentally broadcast it live four hours earlier.

Starting at 3 p.m. on ESPNU’s “Bracketology” show, the college basketball analysts Rece Davis, Jay Bilas, Seth Greenberg and Jay Williams were discussing the men’s bracket, which was released Sunday night. While the men’s bracket appeared front-and-center on the broadcast, the women’s bracket was shown in pieces on the side.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>At a time when measles outbreaks are mounting among clusters of unvaccinated children, notably in Washington State, New York and Texas, a new large study published this week found no association between the measles vaccine and autism — a reason often given by parents for rejecting inoculation.

The new research confirms what has long been widely accepted in the scientific community, and it echoes findings of a 2002 study by members of the same team of scientists about the vaccine, known as MMR because it protects against measles, mumps and rubella.

But the findings come at a moment of resurging suspicion about vaccine safety, that has been promulgated at the far edges of the internet and on mainstream sites such as Amazon, Facebook and Pinterest. Many of those companies have taken steps in recent weeks to remove anti-vaccine content, but on Monday, the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, Dr. Kyle E. Yasuda, wrote to the chief executives of Google, Facebook and Pinterest, urging further action in “an urgent request to work together to combat the dangerous spread of vaccine misinformation online.”

In emphatic language, the researchers, who followed 657,461 Danish children born between 1999 and 2010, stated in the Annals of Internal Medicine: “The study strongly supports that MMR vaccination does not increase the risk for autism, does not trigger autism in susceptible children, and is not associated with clustering of autism cases after vaccination.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>If an elite school is a branding exercise, that brand is perhaps more valuable to rich parents than to rich kids. An underperforming, school-averse teenager is often content to attend a low-pressure state school with good parties; it’s his parents who are desperate to prevent this. More than faking their kids’ athletic or test-taking prowess, these parents have faked their own parenting. They did not wind up raising enviable, academically extraordinary children, but they’ve fudged the results so they can drop “U.S.C.” in conversations instead of “A.S.U.” Some went to comical lengths to hide these interventions from their children, while others, including Olivia’s parents, supposedly involved the kids, letting them know the exact distance between what they were getting and what they deserved. When these parents celebrated their success, you might imagine they were reacting not with pride but with relief: They had managed to prevent their kids from messing up the paths they had planned for them.

They had also helped convince the rest of us that their kids really were successful. We still like to picture our higher-education system as the linchpin of a meritocracy, like a public utility that sorts the accomplished from the rest. We instinctively conflate elite schooling with worth. The idea of unqualified kids getting into Stanford or Georgetown may rankle us, but this scandal should also call into question the outsize reputations of such schools. They exist partly through a bargain in which wealthy elites commingle with the highest-achieving students of the lower and middle classes. The wealthy launder their privilege by allowing select others to earn their way into its orbit. And the intelligence and success of hardworking peers makes a wealthy wastrel seem qualified by association: Maybe he graduated with straight C’s, a drinking problem and an unearned job at the family business, but he went to Yale — isn’t that where smart people go?

Right before the video clip that was isolated for optimum Twitter shaming, Olivia Jade says something else revealing: She is worried that other kids at school are going to take advantage of her. “That’s already my big fear of meeting people at my college — that they are just going to use me,” she says. She seems to see the value of a good education, in exactly the way so many parents see it: as a transaction.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>JERUSALEM — By turns angry and choked up, sneering and defiant, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a lengthy, emotional response Thursday night to the decision by Israel’s attorney general to indict him on bribery and other corruption charges.

He spoke on national television in prime time, his voice breaking when he alluded to the trial of his wife, Sara, on charges that she misused about $100,000 of state funds, and to their son Yair, a right-wing provocateur on social media. They were also investigated, but the attorney general said neither would be charged.

Here are excerpts from Mr. Netanyahu’s remarks, and what we think he meant by them.

TEXT “Citizens of Israel, last night I met in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin. I made it clear to him that we would continue to act with all our might against Iran’s attempts to entrench itself militarily in Syria. I thank my friend, President Putin, who accepted my remarks. When I returned to Israel I heard this morning the words of support for me by U.S. President Donald Trump. He praised, and I quote, my strong, intelligent and resolute leadership of the State of Israel. I thank my friend, President Trump, for his remarks …. That unique relationship with the leaders of the world powers isn’t a trifling matter. It isn’t self-evident. I’ve been building it for many years, and it has helped me ensure our security and our future. It’s helped me safeguard our country.”

SUBTEXT The presidents of the United States and Russia are my friends, and no one running against me can say that. It’s taken me years to build those relationships. Don’t throw them away. I am keeping you safe.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>FORT MYERS, Fla. — Boston Red Sox pitcher Steven Wright will be barred for the first 80 games of the season after testing positive for human growth hormone, a second suspension for Wright after he missed 15 games last year for violating baseball’s domestic violence policy.

Wright, 34, said in a statement issued through the Major League Baseball Players Association that he had learned of the positive test during the off-season.

“Although I do not dispute the validity of the test, I was shocked as I have never intentionally ingested anything for performance-enhancing purposes,” he said in the statement. “I have fully cooperated with M.L.B. and will continue to try and identify the source of the result.”

The commissioner’s office said Wright had tested positive for Growth Hormone Releasing Peptide 2 (GHRP-2). He is the second player under the big-league program to test positive for H.G.H., which has been screened for by baseball in blood tests since 2013.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>This week Rebecca Dinerstein writes about Michael Downing’s “Still in Love,” the belated sequel to the novel “Perfect Agreement,” which David Willis McCullough reviewed for the Book Review in 1997.

The major trial-balloon subplot — and by far the most successful — is a long historical flashback interwoven with the contemporary goings-on. Here we are taken to a Shaker settlement in Kentucky and a young girl who sees a dark-skinned man that the community wants to believe is a mystical vision of a black Jesus. Downing is better at writing about Shakers than Hawthorne or Melville, who had them for neighbors. (Perhaps that’s the reason.) The setting is just right. The feeling for the community and its members rings true, especially in small details like the sweeping of a walk, which an outsider sees as a chore and the Shaker sweeper as an act of worship. …

Because of the sampler structure of “Perfect Agreement,” the reader is left in the curious position of choosing sides with one part of the novel against another. The comedy is fun, but it doesn’t last long. The spelling rules are useful, but this is, after all, a novel, not a textbook. … But the Shaker material is first-rate. And the title is just right. The book is about perfect agreements — or at least the desire for them — in grammar, in domestic life, in work, in education and in utopian theology (which may not be very different from everyday theology).</TEXT>

A poster hanging on the walls of New York City subway stations advertises a new book celebrating the life and work of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, calling the Supreme Court justice a “trail blazer” and a “history maker.”

On Tuesday, the advertisement at one Brooklyn subway stop included another message: an anti-Semitic slur and a swastika scrawled over her face.

The New York Police Department’s hate crimes unit and officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority were investigating the incident, which came to wider attention after it was reported by a commuter on Twitter, officials said.

The vandalism, which was swiftly condemned by city officials, came amid a rise in hate crimes in New York City, driven in large part by anti-Semitic attacks and incidents. There were 86 hate crimes reported in the city this year as of March 10, an increase of 62 percent over the same time period last year, the police said. About 60 percent of those were anti-Semitic crimes, with 52 such incidents reported so far this year, compared with 32 by the same time in 2018.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>A hospital in Yemen supported by Save the Children was hit Tuesday by a deadly airstrike that charity officials blamed on the Saudi-led coalition, an attack carried out on the war’s fourth anniversary.

At least seven people were killed, including four children, when a missile struck a gasoline station only yards from the entrance to the Kitaf hospital in rural northwest Yemen about 60 miles from the city of Saada, Save the Children officials said.

The attack damaged the waiting rooms and occurred at the busiest time of the morning for the hospital, said Jason Lee, Save the Children’s deputy director in Yemen.

He said the organization had lodged a strong protest over the airstrike with the Saudi-led authorities, who had the coordinates of the hospital and should have known to avoid the area.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>What seemed like a relatively slow news days decelerated further when Fox News took a moment to declare that the 94-year-old Jimmy Carter had become the oldest former living United States president in history, surpassing the first President George Bush.

Then, at last, came the news that the special counsel’s work was done.

After all the buildup, the anchors had one new development to gnaw on: the fact that, according to a Justice Department official, the Mueller report recommended no new charges. (Before the report was submitted, the special counsel had filed 199 charges against 34 people and three companies.)

On NBC, after the main news had hit, the veteran Justice Department reporter Pete Williams reported that “there will be no more indictments from the special counsel.” Others seemed reluctant to go there, at least at first. “Nobody knows anything,” MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough cautioned on Twitter. And the Fox News anchor Bret Baier said, “We don’t have the meat of what’s in this report at this hour.”

Appearing as a guest on Mr. Baier’s show, the Fox News host Chris Wallace said: “The fact that that investigation is over is a big milestone, even if we don’t know what the final conclusion of the special counsel was. We will have to wait and see.”

He continued: “And I do think that if — and I repeat if — it should be the president is cleared of the basic fundamental charges of the special counsel, whether it was, one, collusion or, two, obstruction of justice, that is a major victory for the president.”

And before you knew it, television was populated, as it had been earlier in the day, with talking heads spinning out various possibilities that could fill the news maw in the days to come.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>By the numbers: Since December, the authorities have closed more than 140,000 blogs and deleted more than 500,000 articles, according to the state-run news media, saying that they contained false information, distortions or obscenities.

In Indonesia: A sweeping online criminal defamation law has allowed the arrest of a professor who sang an old anti-army song in a video, and 10 months in prison for a housewife who sent four WhatsApp messages that a local company found insulting.

Here’s what else is happening

Trade war: China and the U.S. are pushing to complete a trade deal next month, but with Washington planning to hold the threat of tariffs over Beijing to ensure compliance, some fear the economic damage and uncertainty from the trade war could persist.

Philippines: The country formally withdrew from the International Criminal Court as it faced a preliminary inquiry into whether President Rodrigo Duterte had engaged in mass murder and crimes against humanity in his bloody and extrajudicial drug crackdown. On Thursday, Mr. Duterte publicly released a new list of people that he claims are “narcopoliticians” — including many who are his political opponents.

Cyclone: More than 150 people were killed in a huge cyclone that hit Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. Hundreds more were missing, and tens of thousands of others were stranded in mainly poor, rural areas, officials said.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“Open-heart surgery, particularly in low-risk patients, is very profitable,” Dr. Herrmann said.

More than half a dozen companies make surgical valves, but only two market TAVR valves. Perhaps with more competition, Dr. Herrmann said, prices for TAVR valves will come down.

At the moment, it will be up to most patients which procedure they choose, Dr. Popma said — TAVR or surgery.

For Robert Pettinato , 79-year-old retiree in Scranton, Pa., there was no question. He had been feeling mild chest pain, and he was finding it difficult to finish a round of golf.

But last year, when his cardiologist told Mr. Pettinato that he needed a new valve, the only way he could get TAVR was to enter a clinical trial. He enrolled in the Edwards trial at the University of Pennsylvania.

He had TAVR in November, stayed in the hospital for 24 hours and went home. A few days later, he went to the football game at Lehigh University against its archrival, Lafayette. (He’s a Lehigh alumnus and never misses that game.)

Shortly afterward, his younger brother Jim, who lives in Florida, had to have aortic valve replacement. He wanted TAVR, but the clinical trials were closed. He had surgery instead.

It took his brother four months to recover enough to play a round of golf, Mr. Pettinato said.

Mr. Pettinato is back to playing golf himself. “I am the luckiest guy in the world,” he said.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>One frigid morning last month, April Turner sidled up to the parapet of a 21-story apartment building on the Upper West Side, climbed over the edge and dangled herself 188 feet above the pavement.

Suspended by ropes like the ones used by rock climbers, she slid past balcony ledges and window frames, careful not to lock eyes with dumbstruck residents. With a tiny mallet and a point-and-shoot camera, she cataloged cracks and blemishes on the building’s facade, pausing at each floor to feel around for fatal flaws.

If pedestrians bothered to watch, they might have applauded as she touched down near a neighboring nail salon. Without fanfare, she detached her gear, walked back inside the co-op and took the elevator to the roof for another drop — to canvass another section of the postwar building’s dappled face.

It’s all in a day’s work for a growing number of New York City’s building facade inspectors.

The city requires that of the approximately 1 million buildings in New York City, those taller than six stories — more than 14,500 structures — have their facades inspected every five years, to ensure the safety of passers-by below. Rather than using bulky swing-stage scaffolds, like the ones for window washing, or hydraulic cranes that block traffic, an increasing number of design and engineering firms are training their staff to rappel down the side of skyscrapers in search of dangerous defects.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>CHICAGO — Barely a week after he was bailed out of jail while facing sex abuse charges, R. Kelly was taken back into custody on Wednesday for failing to pay his ex-wife more than $160,000 in child support.

Mr. Kelly’s return to jail came just hours after the airing of his first interview since he was charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse in connection with four women, three of whom prosecutors say were underage at the time. He was released last week on a $100,000 bond paid by a friend after several days of apparently struggling to come up with the money.

In the interview, with Gayle King of “CBS This Morning,” he was emotional and unyielding. He denied having had sex with underage girls and portrayed himself as a victim of a social media-fueled smear campaign.

[Two women living with R. Kelly denied being brainwashed.]

Mr. Kelly, 52, whose real name is Robert Kelly, screamed, cursed and pleaded to the camera.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Before Judge Ellis, Mr. Manafort’s lawyers repeatedly suggested that the special counsel’s office pursued their client because of his importance to the Russia inquiry. They said his political consulting work for four American presidents, including Mr. Trump, spoke to his high ideals. And they argued that the special counsel’s office had vilified him for what are essentially garden-variety crimes that for other defendants merited only limited time behind bars.

“Most importantly, what you saw today is the same thing that we have said from Day 1,” Mr. Downing, one of Mr. Manafort’s lawyers, said in a short statement outside the courthouse. “There is absolutely no evidence that Paul Manafort was involved in any collusion with any government official or Russia.”

While Judge Ellis faulted Mr. Manafort for not apologizing for his criminal conduct, he also noted that the special counsel’s office had not requested a specific prison term.

During the trial, prosecutors put forward exhaustive evidence of how Mr. Manafort had illegally concealed his work on behalf of political parties in Ukraine that were aligned with Russia and of how he hid more than $55 million in payments from that work in more than 30 overseas bank accounts.

Once his income from Ukraine dried up, the evidence showed, Mr. Manafort deceived banks to obtain loans to sustain a lavish lifestyle. At the same time, he worked for the Trump campaign at no cost, apparently hoping his status as campaign chairman would attract deep-pocketed foreign clients. He was fired from the campaign after five months when the scandal over his hidden income from Ukraine broke in August 2016.

“The defendant blames everyone from the special counsel’s office to his Ukrainian clients for his own criminal choices,” prosecutors wrote in a sentencing memo.

Mr. Manafort was indicted on 18 counts in the Northern Virginia case, but the jury convicted him on only eight: five counts of tax fraud, two counts of bank fraud and one count of failure to disclose a foreign bank account. Because of one holdout juror, the panel deadlocked on the other charges. Mr. Manafort admitted that he was guilty of those as well, though, as part of his plea agreement.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Robert K. Kraft, the New England Patriots owner, has asked the judge overseeing his case on charges of solicitation of prostitution to suppress key evidence against him, including video that the police have said shows him receiving sex from a masseuse at a spa in Jupiter, Fla.

The filing in Palm Beach County on Thursday is the latest effort by Mr. Kraft, who was charged with along with 24 other men, to have the misdemeanor charges thrown out and keep the video of the incidents on which they are based from public view.

Last week, Mr. Kraft asked that the evidence be kept private only until his case was finished.

The fate of the video, which could prove embarrassing as well as incriminating, has turned into the central tug-of-war in the case, which began in late February when the police in Palm Beach County charged Mr. Kraft and the other men with soliciting prostitution at the Orchids of Asia spa.

The case has garnered international attention for its mix of sex, celebrity and sports, and Mr. Kraft’s decision to fight the charges has turned what are normally perfunctory legal proceedings into a high-stakes game of chicken with prosecutors and the police in South Florida.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>They share a name, and both espouse a love of guns, but beyond that, the National Rifle Association in New Zealand has little in common with America’s most powerful gun advocacy group.

The New Zealand organization, which has no formal connection to the N.R.A. in the United States, is the country’s governing body for the sport of long-range target shooting. It does not engage in the sort of political lobbying for which the American group has built such a fierce reputation.

And that helps explain why the New Zealand group’s reaction to the massacre at two mosques in Christchurch last week has borne little resemblance to how the American N.R.A. has responded to recent mass shootings in the United States.

On Thursday, six days after the Christchurch attacks, New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, announced a national ban on military-style semiautomatic weapons, on parts that allow guns to be modified into such weapons, and on high-capacity ammunition magazines.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Americans are still scarred by the financial crisis, and the fruits of this decade’s record-breaking rally fell mostly to the rich.

The financial system had nearly collapsed. The deepest recession in decades was devouring over 700,000 jobs a month. Roughly $13 trillion in stock market wealth, slowly rebuilt since the dot-com bust, had again been incinerated.

It was March 2009. And it was one of the best times in a generation to buy stocks.

A decade later, the bull market that began back then ranks among the great rallies in stock-market history. The 305 percent surge in the S&amp;P 500 is the index’s second-best run ever.

The rise has generated more than $30 trillion in wealth. Adjusted for inflation, that is the most created during any bull run on record, edging out the $25 trillion in gains during the epic streak from December 1987 to March 2000, which ended with the bursting of the dot-com bubble, according to Federal Reserve data.

But compared with Americans’ attitudes during that earlier climb, reactions to the latest rally are downright subdued. There has been no frenzy for stock trading. Nobody is quitting an accounting, advertising, or waitressing job to concentrate on day trading.</TEXT>

A 7-year-old Guatemalan girl who died in United States custody last December was suffering from a bacterial infection that was so advanced she probably would have been visibly sick for many hours, said several physicians who reviewed a newly released autopsy report of her death.

By the time the girl, Jakelin Caal Maquin, arrived at a children’s hospital in El Paso with seizures and difficulty breathing, she already had severe blood abnormalities, according to a part of the report that summarized her condition in the emergency room of the Children’s Hospital at the Hospitals of Providence Memorial Campus.

The new findings were released on Friday by the El Paso County Office of the Medical Examiner. Customs and Border Protection officials and lawyers for the girl’s family have sparred over whether the severity of her infection — with a common streptococcus bacteria — should have been recognized and whether she should have been taken for medical care more quickly.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>And yet, as Prof. Matthew O. Jackson of Stanford observes in his compelling new book, “The Human Network: How Your Social Position Determines Your Power, Beliefs and Behaviors,” the data demonstrates that “many people’s perceptions of mobility and reality are mismatched.”

Professor Jackson points out that 84 percent of Americans answer in the affirmative when asked whether they agree with the statement “If I work hard, I can improve my life.” But the United States ranks toward the very bottom of the scale of something called “intergenerational earnings elasticity,” a measure of how tied your future financial potential is to how rich your parents are. It is probably not unexpected that Denmark does better than we do on this measure of social mobility, but a child born in Pakistan has a better chance of escaping from poverty than one brought up here. Closer to home, by this measure, the United States “has more than double the immobility of Canada.”

Interestingly, across national geographies, inequality and immobility are quite tightly correlated. But correlation is not causation, and, as Professor Jackson convincingly shows, simplistic and expensive proposals to reduce inequality like a guaranteed minimum income are unlikely to make a meaningful dent in immobility.

But why can’t money buy you mobility? “The Human Network” is most fascinating and convincing in addressing this question. Professor Jackson has been studying how networks operate for over a quarter-century. In particular, he has focused on the implications that stem from “the general tendency of people to interact with others who are similar to themselves.” He shows that “the entrenched networks of information and norms” that underpin this inclination are the primary force behind immobility. Inequality, he concludes, can be viewed “as a result and not as the root cause.”

One study Professor Jackson highlights demonstrates how money alone will not solve immobility. In the 1990s, selected public housing residents were provided with two different kinds of free rent vouchers: those that could be used anywhere, and those that could be used only in low-poverty neighborhoods. The positive impact on the lives of the children in the latter group was powerful in terms of whether they went to college, which one they attended and their income level. Many of those with the unrestricted vouchers decided to stay put and just reduce their rent bill. The data shows this strategy to have imposed a significant cost to their children’s financial future.</TEXT>

Near the High Line in Manhattan, more than 250 people gathered at The Park, a restaurant, last week to hear about a Democratic mayor’s long-shot bid for the presidency.

The New York City Council speaker, Corey Johnson, worked the crowd, boasting about the mayor’s accomplishments, and how he had done a “tremendous amount” to “create jobs” and move “the conversation nationally” to important issues.

But the mayor in question was not Bill de Blasio, mayor of New York City, population 8.6 million. It was Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Ind., population 102,245.

Both men are considering a presidential run but only one of their potential candidacies seems to be taken seriously.</TEXT>

      <TITLE>Review: Amazon’s ‘Hanna,’ Genetically Modified for Streaming Video - The New York Times</TITLE>

      <TEXT>In the series the Grimms are gone, and Hanna (played by the young British actress Esme Creed-Miles) is less magical heroine and more angtsy teenage supersoldier — la femme Nikita without the clingy dresses. The heroes are less heroic and the baddies less monstrous, and their back stories are expanded in ways that make them more “complex” but no more interesting. The mysteries of Hanna’s past are explored in much greater detail, while the sense of mystery never quite takes hold.

The literalization of the story for streaming-series purposes is encapsulated in the new opening, a long, expository chase scene that was a brief flashback in the film. Another crucial change in the first episode, discreetly slipped into the dialogue, recasts the entire plot, changing the motive for Hanna’s mission from revenge to survival — a switch that lowers the intensity but opens the door for complications, digressions and future seasons.

A more prosaic “Hanna” could certainly succeed on its own terms in the crowded field of action-oriented conspiracy thriller. The bigger problem, though, is that most of what Farr has added to pad out the story is drab filler: marital strife in the normal family that shelters Hanna, Marissa’s problems with work-life balance, boyfriend tensions between Hanna and her pal Sophie. (Rhianne Barreto, as the angry Sophie, gives the show’s most energetic and engaging performance.) The series is filled with all the things that Wright, in the film, proved the story could do without.

Beating “Hanna” the series with the stick of “Hanna” the film would be less fair if the series didn’t, through about six episodes, hew so closely to the framework of the movie. And you can’t really address the subject without noting the perfect casting in the original of Saoirse Ronan as Hanna, with her ability to be both ethereal and feral, dreamlike and convincingly physical. Creed-Miles, by comparison, is, well, a good soldier. Mireille Enos and Joel Kinnaman, as Marissa and Erik, work hard in roles that have been glummed down from what Cate Blanchett and Eric Bana played in the original.

If you stick with Amazon’s “Hanna,” its energy and interest (if not originality) tick up in the last couple episodes, when the story definitively moves beyond that of the movie and capitalizes on a couple of plot possibilities that the film closed off or glossed over. Yasmin Monet Prince, a striking British actress with a very short list of screen credits, turns up as a character you wish had been around for the previous six hours. Suddenly it feels like you’re in a fairy tale again.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Tanitoluwa Adewumi, age 8, skidded around the empty apartment, laughing excitedly, then leapt onto his dad’s back. “I have a home!” he said in wonderment. “I have a home!”

A week ago, the boy was homeless, studying chess moves while lying on the floor of a shelter in Manhattan. Now Tani, as he is known, has a home, a six-figure bank account, scholarship offers from three elite private schools and an invitation to meet President Bill Clinton.

“I think I am still dreaming,” said Tani’s dad, Kayode Adewumi. “I hope I don’t wake up.”

I wrote in my column last weekend about Tani as a reminder of the principle that talent is universal, even if opportunity is not. A Nigerian refugee who had learned chess only a bit more than a year earlier, he had just defeated kids from elite private schools to win the New York state chess championship for his age group. He lugged a trophy nearly as big as he is back to the homeless shelter.

Now the story gets even better.

After my column about this hard-working family, a GoFundMe drive raised more than $200,000 for Tani, his parents and his brother. A half-dozen readers offered housing — in a couple of cases, palatial quarters. Immigration lawyers offered pro bono assistance to the Adewumis, who are in the country legally and seeking asylum. Three film companies are vying to make movies about Tani.</TEXT>

They married June 24, 1990 at the Hillcrest Jewish Center in Fresh Meadows, N.Y., before 158 guests. Both the bride and the groom had separate car issues and each arrived more than an hour late, missing their photo time. Ms. Mandelsberg drove herself and got lost en route — a police car pulled her over and ended up escorting her to the center. Mr. Weiss’s hired car never showed, and he had to call another car service.

The couple live in Plainview, N.Y., and have two children, both in their mid-20s.

Ms. Mandelsberg and Mr. Weiss met in 1977 at a Jewish singles weekend at Grossinger’s Catskill Resort Hotel in Liberty, N.Y. Ms. Mandelsberg, then 21 and an English teacher at a Brooklyn yeshiva, had driven there with her aunt, uncle and girlfriends.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Right. And Dow was particularly offended by this because napalm was a very small part of its business. I mean, it accounted, I think, for a half of 1 percent of its annual sales. And yet it had sort of come to take over its corporate identity. So there was some internal discussion, there were some debates within the company and at the board level about what to do, whether to stop manufacturing napalm. And there were lots of reasons for that. I mean, there were customer boycotts. They did take a financial hit. And they had to do a lot to counter their corporate reputation as a warmonger. But what they really worried about was recruiting. They worried that on these visits to college campuses they weren’t going to get the best people. They weren’t going to get the scientists and the engineers who would help them in the years ahead. And as a result, they would have long-term costs, not just financial, but also in terms of what they were missing out on.

Right. And I want to be clear: What happened at Google was the exception, not the rule. This is not happening in any vast quantity across the tech industry. At Microsoft, for example, they came right out and said, we appreciate the objections of this small group of employees. They can move elsewhere in the company if they want, but we’re committed to seeing this contract through. And they’ve defended themselves by saying, we have a patriotic duty to provide technology to the military. We think that we can advocate for the ethical use of technologies like AI if we’re at the table in these discussions. And they say that basically, these technologies could be good. These could save lives on the battlefield. The army has said it wants to use HoloLens not just for combat training, but for things like measuring vital signs, and monitoring soldiers for concussions, and having some sort of hearing protection on people’s ears. So those are the kinds of arguments they’re making to justify staying in these contracts.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The Rolling Stones said on Saturday that Mick Jagger required medical treatment for an unspecified health problem and that the band would postpone its spring tour in the United States and Canada.

Jagger’s doctors advised him not to go on the remaining 17 shows of the tour but expected him to make a “complete recovery,” according to a statement from the band. Jagger, 75, apologized to fans.

“I really hate letting you down like this,” he said in a tweet. “I’m devastated for having to postpone the tour but I will be working very hard to be back on stage as soon as I can.”

The band, which got its start more than five decades ago, performed the first two legs of its “No Filter” tour in Europe during fall 2017 and spring 2018. The final leg of the tour was scheduled to take the band through American cities including Miami, Houston, Denver and Chicago, as well as a venue north of Toronto. The Stones were scheduled to play at New Orleans Jazz Festival in May.</TEXT>

The weather comes during a winter of extremes. In late January, Chicago broke a record for lowest maximum daily temperature at minus 10 degrees, busting its earlier record of minus 3 degrees. The city also hit a record daily low at minus 23 degrees.

A few days later, in early February, Washington, D.C., broke a 28-year record when highs reached 70 degrees, a balmy temperature more common to South Texas or Los Angeles.

Last month, though, was the first February on record that downtown Los Angeles did not reach 70 degrees, a milestone marked by light grousing from Angelenos. But when it snowed in the city last week, it prompted a flurry of delighted social media posts. And when the Bay Area got a dusting earlier this month, residents of the region got out their sleds.

According to climate experts, increasing weather extremes are in keeping with broader predictions of climate change. Severe weather — be it precipitation or cold — worries observers in the Golden State, where every storm brings the risk of mudslides in fire-scarred communities and flooding. Daniel Swain, a California climate scientist, said that climate change is making extreme swings between warm weather and cold weather, drought and rain, the new normal.

[Read: Both sides of the climate change debate are using extreme weather in their arguments.]

“Things are changing faster than I think has been apparent to a lot of people,” he said. “It seems incremental until it doesn’t.”

He said he had heard stories from Californians who did not think much about wildfires — they were just things on the news — until they found themselves screaming at their children to get in the car before flames reached their homes. He said he had also heard from South Lake Tahoe residents who had owned their homes at lake level for decades and who said that they had noticed their yards were getting blanketed less and less frequently. So when it does snow in years like this, the contrast is more marked.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>If you’re dining on the West Coast, steelhead is likely to be familiar. Not so much in the East until very recently, when farm-raised steelhead started showing up. The delicious salmonlike fish is native to the waters off California, Oregon and Washington. It’s essentially a robust rainbow trout that has spawned in fresh water rivers and streams but then, like salmon, has gone out to sea, where it grows bigger, with typically orange-red flesh. In the wild, it is a federally protected species, with a regulated commercial fishery. There is some recreational steelhead fishing in New York State and the surrounding areas because rainbow trout was introduced from the West about 150 years ago . Now steelhead is being farmed in an indoor facility upstate, Hudson Valley Fisheries, where it can reach nearly seven pounds and is raised without hormones, antibiotics and parasiticides. Chefs have started using it, and it’s sold for home cooks. Prepare it like salmon; it’s rich in both flavor and texture.

Steelhead trout, $14 a pound at Fairway Markets in New York City, $12 in the suburbs, fairwaymarket.com.

      <TEXT>The supplements’ appeal is understandable. A growing older population with longer life spans means more people with dementia, though in population-based studies in this and other Western countries, its prevalence has fallen.

More of us have seen the devastation up close and would do almost anything to evade it. But so far, the news about drugs and supplements has been discouraging.

Although scientists have learned much more about dementia, the research literature and large pharmaceutical trials have mostly served to tell worried Americans about the many substances that don’t appear to prevent, treat or slow dementia.

Vitamins, various antioxidants, concoctions derived from animals and plants — “we see plenty of ads on TV, but we have no evidence that any of these things are preventive,” said Dr. Steven DeKosky, a neurologist and deputy director of the McKnight Brain Institute at the University of Florida.

Dr. DeKosky led a federally supported study of Ginkgo biloba extract, for instance, following more than 3,000 people for seven years to see if it reduced dementia. It didn’t.

“No effects at all,” he said. “But look on the shelves. Many companies still sell ginkgo — if there’s really any in there, because supplements don’t always have the contents they say they have.”

Moreover, “some of these supplements are biologically active and can cause toxicity when you take other drugs,” said Dr. DeKosky. Supplements can be costly, too.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Initial euphoria over the Algerian president’s decision to give up his candidacy for a fifth term quickly gave way on Tuesday to skepticism and anger among opposition figures who called the move a “trick” to save his troubled government.

Hundreds of youthful protesters returned to the streets of Algiers and other cities a day after the government canceled the April election, and the country’s independent news media gave voice to a sense that the elderly and infirm president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, was maneuvering to extend his mandate under the guise of “reform.”

Independent television in Algeria broadcast images of demonstrators holding signs with messages like “No extension, game over” and “System, give it up,” using one of the names Algerians commonly give to the ruling circle.

The way forward in this giant, oil-rich North African country, four times the size of its former colonizer, France, is unclear. What is nearly certain, though, is that the anti-government demonstrations that have repeatedly hit cities and towns from the coastal north to the desert south will continue.</TEXT>

That was Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, above, after 49 people were killed in shootings at two mosques during Friday Prayer in central Christchurch. The terrorist attack also left dozens wounded.

A suspect has been charged with murder and appeared in court Saturday morning local time. The 28-year-old Australian man was apparently motivated by white nationalism and a desire to drive cultural, political and racial wedges between people across the globe. Here’s what we know about him.

Ms. Ardern said a total of five firearms, including two semiautomatic weapons, were used in the attacks. We’ll continue to provide live updates here.</TEXT>

      <TITLE>Medicare for All Would Abolish Private Insurance. ‘There’s No Precedent in American History.’ - The New York Times</TITLE>

      <TEXT>Ms. Harris, asked directly about getting rid of private health insurance during a CNN forum in January, answered, “Let’s eliminate all that. Let’s move on.” But after her comments were characterized as extreme, her campaign quickly clarified that, while she continued to endorse the Sanders plan, she would also support more incremental expansions of health coverage.

During her CNN forum last week, Ms. Warren said she was open to various ways to get to universal coverage. “When we talk about Medicare for all, there are a lot of different pathways,” she said. “What we’re all looking for is the lowest cost way to make sure that everybody gets covered.”

Dr. David Blumenthal, a former Obama administration official who is now chief executive of the Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit that funds health care research, voiced concern about the prospects for the most transformative approach. “I do think it’s an uphill battle to take things away from people in the name of giving them something better,” he said.

Believers in markets argue that consumer choice and competition among private health plans improve the quality of care. Others laud private industry’s relative nimbleness compared with Medicare, which can be bureaucratic and prone to political influence.

“Private plans have been able to evolve and test new models more quickly,” said Caroline Pearson, a senior vice president at NORC, a research organization at the University of Chicago. “The political process slows things down.”

In a Medicare-for-all world, private insurers might evolve into contractors for the big government system. They already perform various functions for Medicare, including helping the program manage paying its bills. The industry could retain that role, or take on new responsibilities.

“The government would have to build out infrastructure if they were to shut down all the private insurance companies,” said Mark Bertolini, the former chief executive of Aetna, now part of CVS Health. “It’s not that simple pulling all that apart.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Peter Zhu, a West Point cadet who died last week, always wanted to be a father, his parents said. His dream was to live on a ranch, where he would have horses and raise five children, never mind his parents’ jokes about how much all of that would cost.

Now, thanks to a court order, his parents can hope that some part of that dream may still come true.

Mr. Zhu, 21, was found lying in the snow on a ski slope at the United States Military Academy at West Point on Feb. 23 after an accident left him with a severely fractured spine. He was taken to Westchester Medical Center, where he was declared brain-dead on Feb. 27. But because he was an organ donor, his body was kept alive until March 1.

In the two days between the death of his brain and the death of his body, Mr. Zhu’s grief-stricken parents — desperate to hold on to a piece of him and determined to pass their family name to the next generation — petitioned a state court to allow them to retrieve his sperm before his organs were removed.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Madrid sits third in La Liga, behind not only Barcelona but also its city rival, Atlético; it is out of the Copa del Rey; and, most damaging of all, it was eliminated by Ajax in the last 16 of the Champions League last week, losing the second leg of the tie by 4-1 at home. “We are going through a difficult and complicated moment,” Pérez said. “We know what pain that brings the fans.”

Little wonder, then, that Zidane — just as he did when he left Madrid, five days after lifting the third of those Champions Leagues — took to the rostrum once again speaking of the need for change. “This club is what had to and has to change,” he said. “Things have to change, in every way. We have to change for next season.”

The nature of the change, though, is likely to be very different: Real must transform from a position of relative weakness, rather than strength. That is likely to mean a considerable overhaul of the playing staff: Pérez had long since accepted the need for an injection of funds into the team this coming summer, with the likes of Eden Hazard, the Chelsea forward, under consideration to join a third incarnation of the so-called Galactico project. Several high-profile members of the current squad, including Isco and Gareth Bale, may well have to be sacrificed to balance the books.

The principal difference, then, is Zidane’s energy for the challenge. “I left the club because I needed it, for me, though at the time the club did not,” he said. “Since I love the president, and the club, I am here. After eight months, I want to coach again.”

He has spent the last nine months, he said, “recharging my batteries, doing my things.” His list of honors, the unbroken European success he enjoyed in his first and only managerial role, ensured that he had not been short of suitors — he said he had received offers from several other teams — but none offered the emotional allure of Real.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WASHINGTON — A dozen Republicans joined Senate Democrats on Thursday to overturn President Trump’s declaration of a national emergency at the southwestern border, arguing that the president had exceeded his powers in trying to build a border wall over Congress’s objections.

The 59-to-41 vote on a measure already approved by the House set up the first veto of Mr. Trump’s presidency. It was not a big enough margin to override his promised veto, but Congress has now voted for the first time to block a presidential emergency declaration — and on one of the core promises that animated Mr. Trump’s political rise.

“Never before has a president asked for funding, Congress has not provided it, and the president then has used the National Emergencies Act of 1976 to spend the money anyway,” said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee. “Our nation’s founders gave to Congress the power to approve all spending so that the president would not have too much power. This check on the executive is a crucial source of our freedom.”

It was the latest sign that the cautious Republican majority in the Senate, spurred on by a far bolder Democrat-controlled House, was beginning to reassert its authority with a president who had gone virtually unchecked during his first two years in office.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Michael Jackson’s damaged reputation began to recover the day he died.

The lurid accusations of child molestation that had dogged him for years fell to the background as fans around the world celebrated the entertainer who had gone from pop prodigy to global superstar over a four-decade career. Flash mobs from Stockholm to the Philippines re-enacted his video scenes, and his music sales again broke chart records.

Now, nearly 10 years after his death, the dark side of Mr. Jackson’s legend has returned through a documentary that rocked the Sundance Film Festival and is being championed by Oprah Winfrey. In addition to delivering a hit to his mended reputation, the film poses a significant risk to the Jackson estate, which has engineered a thriving posthumous career, including a Broadway-bound jukebox musical.

The four-hour documentary, “Leaving Neverland,” to be broadcast on HBO in two parts on Sunday and Monday, focuses on the wrenching testimony of two men, Wade Robson and James Safechuck, who say Mr. Jackson abused them for years, starting when they were young boys. While the accusations are not new, their revival in the #MeToo era, with its momentum of accountability for figures like R. Kelly, Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby, gives them new meaning.

“There has always been this shadow or cloud about Michael,” said Charles Koppelman, a longtime music executive who once served as a financial adviser to Mr. Jackson. “With this documentary about to be shown to millions and millions of people, and all the notoriety that it’s now getting, I think it will have a detrimental effect to the legacy and the estate.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Nina Simone’s “Mississippi Goddam,” Ritchie Valens’s “La Bamba” and the original 1968 Broadway cast album of “Hair” are among the 25 recordings that were placed on the Library of Congress’ National Recording Registry on Wednesday as part of its 2018 class.

Each year the library admits a new batch recordings into the registry, which functions as a kind of hall of fame of American recorded sound.

The 2018 class also includes the album “Superfly” by Curtis Mayfield, a funk classic; Jay-Z’s hip-hop masterpiece “The Blueprint”; and the earliest known recordings of Yiddish songs, captured at the start of the 20th century. It features disco, Western choral music and Native American field recordings from the Dust Bowl era.

Nonmusical recordings are admitted to the registry as well. Among this year’s lot are Robert F. Kennedy’s speech on April 4, 1968, the date of Martin Luther King Jr.’s murder, and the monologues of Ruth Draper, a famed actress in the early to mid-20th century.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>When Amazon announced last month that it was canceling plans to build a major campus in Queens, the company did not directly blame any one person or group.

But others have.

Governor Cuomo, who with Mayor de Blasio helped negotiate the deal largely in private, blamed the State Senate, where crucial leaders opposed the plan.

Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who opposed the campus, blamed Amazon for seeking $3 billion in tax breaks and incentives that she said should have been spent elsewhere.

Now a poll is offering insight into how the public feels about the deal’s collapse. Over a third of New Yorkers point the finger at Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, according to a Siena College Research Institute survey of 700 voters.

Here’s what else you need to know about the poll, which was released yesterday:

The deal was popular across the state: Two-thirds of voters said Amazon’s withdrawal was bad for New York.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Since Ricky Gervais’s 2001 hit “The Office” — which was at once hilarious, cringe-worthy and divisive — the comedian has cemented himself in the space where comedy might make you a little uncomfortable. “Anything you do that’s the slightest bit interesting,” he said, “as many people are going to hate it as love it.” He talked to David Marchese about provocation, picking targets and outrage culture. Here are six things we learned.

Gervais uses Twitter to look for material. His 13 million Twitter followers allow him to see a “cross-section of society a thousand times faster than I could’ve otherwise.” He’ll ask them questions like, “What’s a subject you should never joke about?” and can come up with some jokes that way, sometimes just reading out the responses. It’s funny, he maintains, because you think about the one person who would be angry about the joke. “The audience has got to be clever enough to know when I’m playing the idiot and saying the wrong thing for comic effect. That’s one of the things of comedy: laughing at the wrong thing because you know what the right thing is.”

Even his more offensive jokes work because they’re so sophisticated. During his “Humanity” special, Gervais made a joke that begins with a celebrity killing a person with a car and ends in wanting to self-identify as a chimp named Bobo. Still, Gervais maintains that his audience is logical enough to get it. “I become the idiot who believes that being transgender is the same as changing into a chimp,” he told Marchese. “But I have to do the joke like I mean it for it to work.” He continued, “Most people haven’t got the time to analyze the jokes, and I go in and out of the parody too fast for some. But as long as I know the target and some people get it and agree with me, I think the jokes are justified.”

He wants people to know he’s a nice guy. As a comedian and actor who achieved fame for socially awkward characters like David Brent in “The Office,” Gervais tries to be self-aware in his real life. “I do ironic jokes in my social life. All people do that when they joke with each other, and they don’t have to explain themselves. Whereas you do feel the need to explain jokes to strangers.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>MONDAY PUZZLE — Some of you may have hoped for an April Fools’ Day trick as outrageous as the one from 2016 (as well as the Wordplay column that went with it), and some of you may be profoundly thankful that the crossword editors Will Shortz and Joel Fagliano have decided to go in a different direction this year.

It’s only Monday, though, so this year’s April Fools’ Day puzzle is of a gentler sort. All the better to help Mr. Fagliano, the constructor of this puzzle, keep us in line.

There is one word in Mr. Fagliano’s puzzle that might be considered harder than your average Monday entry. DOGES are Venetian officials, according to the dictionary and all of the times the word has appeared in the New York Times Crossword, although some solvers may recognize the word DOGE as a meme featuring a judgmental-looking Shiba Inu.

As Mr. Fagliano acknowledged to me via an email, it’s tough to make an April Fools’ Day puzzle that is both a trick and Monday-easy.</TEXT>

Senator Sherrod Brown, a rumpled liberal populist, is out of the 2020 presidential race. And Joe Biden, the great hope of moderates, is (almost) in.

Newly elected purple-district Democrats in Congress are pledging to voters back home that they’ll “stay in the center.” Ed Rendell, a former Pennsylvania governor and national Democratic chairman, is warning the party that talking about things like single-payer health care and the Green New Deal “plays into the Trump campaign’s hands.”

And former Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado opened his presidential campaign this week by questioning whether “Medicare for all” was “really the right thing.”</TEXT>

An ordeal that ended with police officers shooting a half-naked man in Queens on Sunday afternoon began just before 3 p.m.

The man, who is in his 30s, first crashed his car into a police car in front of the 111th Precinct in Bayside, the police said. He then doused both cars in accelerant fluid and lit his own car on fire. As police officers approached, the man, who was not wearing pants or underwear, lunged at them with a 12-inch kitchen knife.

Two police officers then fired eight gunshots, striking the man in his torso and leg. The man was transported to NewYork-Presbyterian/Queens hospital, where he remained in stable condition on Sunday night. The two officers were also transported to a hospital to be evaluated.

The police did not identify the man but said he was not previously known to the officers in the precinct.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>[The effort to legalize marijuana in New Jersey collapsed on Monday. Read the latest updates here.]

This week the New Jersey Legislature could pass the most progressive recreational marijuana bill in the country. Lawmakers were poised to vote on the issue as early as today.

New York may not legalize marijuana anytime soon.

My colleagues Nick Corasaniti, who covers New Jersey, and Vivian Wang, who covers the New York Legislature, explained.

What makes New Jersey’s marijuana bill so progressive?

Mr. Corasaniti: Mainly, two things: criminal records and access to the market.
• First, the bill would make it possible to expunge nonviolent criminal records for marijuana-related offenses (up to five pounds, one of the highest thresholds in the country).

People with past convictions, or who are incarcerated or on parole, would be eligible for a clean slate, and they could request expungement online.</TEXT>

The Englishman wants to leave, so everyone has to leave” TOUTS: music “This paranoia ,...” TITLE: DISPATCH FROM NORTHERN IRELAND TOUTS: Singing KASSIE: How was Northern Ireland considered when this was - MATTHEW CROSSAN / LUKE MCLAUGHLIN - I don’t think it was considered at all. JASON FEENAN: Brexit is the exit of the United Kingdom based on the wishes of Great Britain. MATTHEW: (When Article 50 was actually triggered) The exact words that Theresa May used was that because of the wishes- THERESA MAY file: Under accordance with the wishes of the British people, the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union MATTHEW: Great Britain consists of Scotland, England and Wales. And the United Kingdom consists of Scotland, England and Wales and Northern Ireland. (MAP) So even in her language it shows that definitely when it first happened there wasn’t much thought. MATTHEW: I am struggling to see any positives for the North of Ireland. But that didn’t last long. The question of Northern Ireland and its border has frustrated negotiations over Brexit. We came here to find out why. And to understand the consequences for people who live here. For the last century, Northern Ireland has had to wrestle with its identity- torn between Protestants who consider themselves British Unionists and Catholics who mostly identify as Irish Nationalists. The divide has brought years of conflict. In 1968 the Catholic minority rose up against Unionist and British control, spurring 30 years of brutal sectarian violence known here as The Troubles. In 1998 both sides came together under the Good Friday Agreement, It created a somewhat unique reality here. Northern Ireland would continue to be a part of the UK, but also, open its border completely with the rest of Ireland. But the history of The Troubles is inescapable. Murals are everywhere. And Neighborhoods are color coded along sectarian lines. Here in Londonderry, or Derry, depending on whom you ask, there are walls that separate Protestants from Catholics. And the gates are locked every night. For punk band Touts, this us and them mentality, has informed more than just their music. LUKE: I’ve lived here 22 years - me whole life, basically and there’s places in Derry I’ve never been, or I’ve never walked to. I think that’s crazy. MIRIAM WHYTE: Well it’s kind of rough,cause there’s the Bogside - the mostly Catholic area then there’s here, which is clearly the more Protestant area, but very divided, even though there’s trying to do more what is it called when they like - integration or something. People told us those divisions have deepened since the Brexit vote. Under Brexit, Northern Ireland would leave with the UK, and the Republic of Ireland would remain in the EU. An idea that appears to overlook the reality on the ground here. We headed east, thinking we could drive along the border - but it wasn’t so simple. In part because the border is mostly invisible. To get from one town in Northern Ireland to another, we crossed into the Republic of Ireland multiple times - without even realizing it. The roads continuously zigzag across international lines. Nat sound Kassie: Oh! We just crossed. Speaker: Ah good morning everyone, my name is Florence and welcome to our cross-border conference, Brexit and Young People, Can You Hear Us? These high school students live in border communities. Many commute seamlessly from one side to the other to attend school. SPEAKER: The project recruits young people from both Protestant and Catholic communities on both sides of border. LARRY: Now does anyone have some strong views on that like how would you see yourselves different than someone in the north? GIRL: If you have an Irish passport, in my mind you’re Irish, doesn’t matter where you’re parents are from, doesn’t matter what background you have, if you carry an Irish passport, you’re Irish. It’s part of the Good Friday agreement: residents of Northern Ireland can choose a British or Irish passport. Or both. DOIRE FINN: People living in Northern Ireland are allowed to have a British passport and an Irish passport and I think I identify as Irish but I mean I hold a British passport so really, for my identity isn’t ever something that in my family was a massive issue. My parents kind of said, “You identify as how you feel” and I think that that was a really nice way to bring us up. DOIRE: The census that was happening here you could either say you were Irish or British my mum wanted to identify as European and they were like, “Well, you’re not allowed” and she was like, “No, I’m identifying myself as European.” And they were like “You have to pick.” By aiming to separate the UK from the EU, Brexit could interrupt the free flow of people and goods - and violate the Good Friday Agreement. ALAN (walking with Kassie) - I hope, I hope when you’ve got photographs my cows now, that we finish up getting a better price for these cows. Alan Mc Farland raises cattle and sheep a few miles north of the border. But he gets his feed from a distributor in the South. It’s a transaction that happens regularly, without border checks, customs duties or tariffs. ALAN McFARLAND: No one knows what the final result is yet going to be - we just approach our business each and every day having made an assumption that post-Brexit we will be trading with the same people on the same terms. KASSIE: Did you feel strongly about staying or leaving? ALAN: I was actually undecided in the matter, to the extent that I didn’t vote at all. But having that said in Northern Ireland the majority of the vote was remaining in the E.U. **GRAPHIC of vote breakdown** ALAN: But one thing I would say you always have the right to change is to change your mind - I would be in favor of a second referendum, to do away with the ambiguity. That’s because many people here remember the border as a source of hostility and violence. And a whole generation since then has grown up without one. HARD BORDER MONTAGE FARMER: NO HARD BORDER GIRL: HARD BORDER LEAD TO TROUBLE SOMEONE ELSE: IT JUST MAKES THINGS HARDER But when Prime Minister Theresa May tried to introduce a provision.. MONTAGE: BACKSTOP BACKSTOP ..that would guarantee an exit without a hard border in Northern Ireland, hardline Brexiters rejected it...arguing an open border would essentially keep the UK tethered to the EU. So no hard border, no deal, and so far no Brexit. ... Also, no sense of where all this could lead. ALAN: I think there should be a second referendum FR. McVEIGH (287_2358.MFX 09:08): I want to see Ireland reunified. Because I think it’s the only hope for this island. Economically, culturally.

We have no common narrative. And it’s going to take a while for us to generate those materials. TOUTS: This paranoia, when will it end, I’ve heard it all before and I’m hearing it again. DAOIRE: I think I’m just really scared about the future of Northern Ireland. I love living here and I think it’s a lovely place to be. The craic’s really good and everyone’s really friendly and I don’t want that to be dragged backwards into a past that was really, really dark for so many people.

There’s some evidence that biological changes that happen in response to trauma, that that’s passed to the next generation and in effect it’s programming the next generation to be able to respond more quickly and rapidly if there’s a bombing or a shooting or whatever. But of course when a child has that it increases the risk of mental illness. Um, there’ve been more deaths by suicide since the signing of the Good Friday agreement than there were through the whole of the troubles through violence.

In Derry, The Touts’ singer and drummer weren’t old enough to vote in the referendum, but they live in the country many expect to be most impacted by the deal. We drove The singer and drummer weren’t old enough to vote in the referendum, but they live in the country many expect to be most impacted by the deal. Theirs is the generation that grew up after the good Friday agreement that ended decades of sectarian violence has only known relative peace in the region. ASSEMBLY 031019 - KASSIE NOTES Notes - I think we need in the narration a sense that, despite the fact this generation is defined by growing up in peace, there are still deep divides and conflict. Brexit has already impacted this by exacerbating polarization and creating economic uncertainty and anxiety that violence could return. I would love to try to use the Touts/kids in park/Derry to establish the “us” v “them” nature of Northern Ireland - I agree the piece is not about sectarianism per se, but it sets up and personalizes the visual sense of place - the “dispatchy-ness” - peace walls and murals, and also then might have more impact when we see that it seems most young people are united in the feeling like they weren’t considered. Also, Brexit was prompted in large part by the us v them mentality in England, but in NI, as compared to the rest of UK, they already have their own us v them which continues today. **** It’s here in Derry where many say “The Troubles” began, in 1968, - when the predominantly Catholic community protested against housing and employment discrimination. A civil rights march was brutally shut down by police/army. It led to roughly 30 years of sectarian violence between the predominantly Catholic Nationalists who consider themselves Irish, and the Unionists, who consider themselves British, the majority, Protestant. BEAT TWO: THE BREXIT Generation in Northern Ireland - Youth/Derry/Recent History - fear of retriggering violence felt most acutely by people nearest the border BEAT THREE: YOUNG PEOPLE’S CONFERENCE Challenging Identity, Good Friday - which allowed people to claim Irish or British citizenships - the idea that the fluidity of movement will be stopped BEAT FOUR: along the actual border between the countries, it is much more complicated - interwoven - FARMER BEAT FIVE: The members of Touts call Derry their home. Many say it’s here where the period known as the “The Troubles” began, in 1968, - when the predominantly Catholic community protested against housing and employment discrimination and unfair voting policies under British rule. But some claimed it to be a cover for paramilitary actors, and a peaceful civil rights march was halted by police in a brutal crackdown. 30 years of deadly sectarian violence followed between the predominantly Catholic Nationalists who consider themselves Irish, and the Unionists, who identify as British - the majority, Protestant. Sound up on Touts Touts may have grown up in the comparatively peaceful era marked by the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. But their city, called Derry by nationalists and Londonderry by unionists remains fractured. The tensions never way and in fact many say Brexit has exacerbated it TOUTS: Line about divisions still there Schools are still mostly segregated along sectarian lines. As are neighborhoods. A TKTK fence/wall helps secure the border between a Catholic community and a Protestant community. Every night, it is locked for protection. TOUTS Line about impact of Brexit already? Or line about Brexit? Just 100 feet away from the wall, in the mostly Protestant community The Fountain, we spoke with a group of teenagers about TKTK MIRIAM: Nearly everyone I spoke with mentioned/agreed the same worst case scenario HARD BORDER MONTAGE To impose a hard border, with check points and official crossings would cause headaches both practically and symbolically. And that’s where the Irish backstop comes in. THERESA MAY: The Irish backstop was the UK’s provision to ensure that Brexit would not Sounds good, but The problem is, Northern Ireland is in a custom’s union that requires a custom’s border PROTESTANT PRIEST: WE had a number of years that we thought we were seeing the sunshine, and now with Brexit it’s as if the sun has gone behind the clouds.

Brexit, and Northern Ireland itself. 45 second history lesson of Northern Ireland And this is the legacy they’ve inherited. NOW made worse by… Brexit! Borders are usually about keeping people in or keeping people out, In this case, But it’s about something more nuanced and complicated, like the border itself DRONE SHOT OF MEANDERING BORDER And Ireland, with its taste for storytelling and humor has a singular relationship with its own border People wandering in and out, funny smuggling stories. LOYALISTS EQUANIMOUS STATEMENT ABOUT BREXIT (maybe from mental health professor) CONCLUSION: AT THE BAR IN DERRY WITH THE TOUTS (with compelling TOUT SOT) One of the other key stipulations of the Good Friday agreement was a free border with the south. Now, Brexit is threatening this. It’s the thing people I spoke with said worried them most. HARD BORDER Montage. Before I got here I’d planned to drive along the border - it wasn’t so simple. Here’s the border. On my TKTK mile journey from TK to TK, I crossed international lines/crossed TKTK times. THIS SECTION TBA BASED ON GRAPHIC I often didn’t even realize I’d crossed. Thirty years ago, this crossing would have looked more like this: FR. McVEIGH (287_2356.MXF 03:23)): The hardline Brexit people are determined to leave without a deal if necessary, or with a deal without a backstop - (that’s the only thing that’s going to satisfy them, and the DUP who are propping up the London government) 04:50 The Brexiteers in London don’t care all that much. Father Joe McVeigh grew up along the border and remembers the checkpoints as violent hotspots. Sound up: Fr. McVeigh shows Kassie photos of the border But this bridge at the border in Belleek shows none of the vestiges of That’s help spur a new momentum for a united Ireland. 13:35 If the Brexit people want to continue their line, they have to consider what’s going to happen to us. We needed to be treated separately and differently. The fear of a hard border, with all of the economic and practical implications has given rise to another potential outcome. FR. McVEIGH (287_2358.MFX 09:08): I want to see Ireland reunified. Because I think it’s the only hope for this island. Economically, culturally. (08:54 It has to happen, it just has to happen 09:45 Partition has run out of road. ) FARMER: Voted to remain in the EU. So leaving the EU would go against the voting majority of Northern Ireland. But leaving the UK altogether would go against the wishes of some of Northern Ireland’s Protestant majority. ANGLICAN: Protestant people would certainly be nervous of any changes. There’s a huge amount of money that comes from Westminster and London. Ironically, the hardline Brexit position has revived some calls for a United Ireland FR. McVEIGH : I want to see Ireland reunified. Because I think it’s the only hope for this island. But positions like Friar McVeigh’s aren’t very popular, especially among Protestants in Northern Ireland’s 6 counties, who would become a minority overnight if they joined Ireland’s 26 as one country. So maybe they could have a political border that remains somewhat relaxed. That’s called a Soft Border or an Irish Backstop. Theresa May: Irish Backstop montage But no one really knows how that would work or what it would look like, which is why it’s been such a bee in the bonnet of the Brexit process. Some hardline Brexiters are calling for the re-establishment of a hard border, a fringe position that proved very unpopular with most of the people I met while I was here: HARD BORDER MONTAGE The hard border was both inconvenient and psychologically fraught. TO SIOBHAN Leaving the United Kingdom altogether would mean losing money from England. The DUP advocates it effectively mean keeping the And that’s why the Irish backstop came up and failed?. THERESA MAY: BACKSTOP MONTAGE. When May tried to introduce a deal that said no hard border, hard brexiteers, including forcing Britain to play by the rules of a single European market even after it separates from the EU, it wouldn’t pass. It was meant to guarantee that there would be no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after the UK separates from the EU. But then, how and where would goods undergo checks as they travel between the UK and the EU. There’s no easy answer? The backstop provision says Britain should continue to play by the rules of a single European market until politicians can agree on how and where goods will undergo checks as they travel between the UK and the EU. But how can the UK leave without violating the terms of the peace treaty that calls for an open border here? Which is, in part, why politicians do not agree on the terms of the backstop, and it’s unclear if they ever will. They didn’t want to feel tethered to the EU. It leaves the question of Brexit unsolved and opens up new questions for Northern Ireland. It all leads to this renewed interest among some people for a united ireland. Of leaving the UK altogether. Siobhan O’Neill is a leading mental health researcher who has studied the legacy of the Troubles, And the border debate has, somewhat ironically, revived an old argument (for reuniting the north with the south) Is FR. McVEIGH (287_2358.MFX 09:08): I want to see Ireland reunified. Because I think it’s the only hope for this island. Economically, culturally. The present is more closely tied to the past here than There’s been a fragile peace here for 20 years but Brexit Well, we’ve got to adopt a trauma-informed approach and think about everything from the perspective of those who’ve been a victim of violence. We have no way of describing it. We have no common narrative. And it’s going to take a while for us to generate those materials. But despite 20 years of fragile peace And Brexit has also had a real psychological impact on the citizens of Northern Ireland For a country that is only a generation away from one of the most bitter conflicts in modern history the tumult How will Northern Ireland SIOBHAN: LINE ABOUT HOW BREXIT HAS ALREADY HAD AN IMPACT</TEXT>

At Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital in New York City, the 58 tiny beds for sick newborns are almost always filled. But nurses who work there say there are often too few of them to provide all of the care the babies, and their worried families, need.

One of those neonatal intensive care nurses, Shanna Murphy, says she has not forgotten the new mother who got upset when she felt her crying infant was being ignored. Ms. Murphy, 28, said she wanted to soothe the baby, but she had her hands full with another patient whose condition had become unstable and required near-constant monitoring.

“I’m often put in a situation where I’m having to choose between patients and not able to fully support my families,” Ms. Murphy said. “We have a family-centered care model, but I cannot do that under these current conditions.”

Now, she and more than 10,000 nurses are demanding a sharp increase in their ranks at three of the city’s biggest hospital systems — Mount Sinai, NewYork-Presbyterian and Montefiore. Their union, the New York State Nurses Association, has threatened to strike over staffing levels, an issue that has become an increasing source of contention at hospitals around the country.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>SAN FRANCISCO — Uber is in talks to sell a stake in its self-driving technologies unit to SoftBank and other investors for as much as $1 billion, as the ride-hailing company prepares to go public, according to four people with knowledge of the matter.

The talks are still underway and may not result in an investment, said the people, who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Apart from SoftBank, the investor consortium includes an automaker, they added.

Under the terms of the proposed deal, investors would purchase from a pool of Uber stock specifically earmarked for the self-driving technologies unit. Uber would maintain majority control of the self-driving arm and would use the investment to fund its research and development. The deal would value the self-driving business at $5 billion to $10 billion, the people said.

Uber filed confidentially to go public in December in what would be one of the largest tech initial public offerings of recent years. The company, based in San Francisco, could hit a valuation of $120 billion when it reaches the stock market.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Considering Michelle Dorrance’s virtuosity as a dancer — which in her medium, tap, is really a type of musician — perhaps it’s not surprising that she also sings and plays the bass. But it’s still a delight to see her do it all, switching seamlessly among roles, as she did in her company’s brief but stellar season at New York City Center.

In some ways, even while multitasking, Ms. Dorrance was taking a step back, making space for voices other than her own. Two programs, on Thursday and Friday, featured a new work by the celebrated clown and comedian Bill Irwin, along with “Jump Monk,” from 1997, by the veteran tapper Brenda Bufalino. Next to Ms. Dorrance’s dances, which on Friday included the premiere of her typically inventive “Basses Loaded,” these opened up a dialogue between generations.

Ms. Dorrance and Mr. Irwin poked fun at their age divide — she’s 39, he’s 68 — in the New York premiere of their collaborative “Lessons in Tradition” (2016), a charming trio with the 28-year-old singer and bassist Kate Davis. Introducing himself and Ms. Davis as “vaudevillians of disparate age and vintage,” Mr. Irwin grudgingly invited Ms. Dorrance to the stage — grudging because then he had to keep up with her. (Naomi Funaki, as an eager assistant, fulfilled his request for an oxygen tank.)</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I had forgotten all about Charlie by the time the darkness started closing in.

We had been friends as kids. I liked to make him laugh. Once, hanging out in the biology lab after school, I borrowed the bow from Charlie’s violin and used it to play a hand saw — a weird vibrating music like something from a synthesizer or a theremin. I remember playing “Over the Rainbow” for him, while he looked on with equal measures of horror and wonder.

One time, he explained to me how he’d taken a household clock apart, gear by gear. “I like disassembling things,” he said, “and then putting them back together.”

Eventually, Charlie went off to Brown, and I headed to Wesleyan. While we were at college, his family moved away, and we lost touch. By the time I arrived in my 50s, I was living in Maine, teaching at Colby College. I married; we had children. I was, by some measures, doing just fine.

But sadness crept up on me now and again, especially as I got older. For a naturally gregarious person, I found it hard to talk to people sometimes. I had the feeling that the universe I lived in was getting smaller, and darker.</TEXT>

Paul J. Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, has been charged in New York with mortgage fraud and more than a dozen other state felonies, the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance, Jr., said Wednesday, an effort to ensure he will still face prison time if Mr. Trump pardons him for his federal crimes.

News of the indictment came shortly after Mr. Manafort was sentenced to his second federal prison term in two weeks; he now faces a combined sentence of more than seven years for tax and bank fraud and conspiracy in two related cases brought by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.

The president has broad power to issue pardons for federal crimes, but has no such authority in state cases.

While Mr. Trump has not said he intends to pardon his former campaign chairman, he has often spoken of his power to pardon and has defended Mr. Manafort on a number of occasions, calling him a “brave man.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>If you’re an airline passenger, automation is your friend — setting aside the fears over its role in the crashes of two Boeing 737 Max planes in the past five months. The gradual spread of automation through the civil aircraft fleet is a primary reason the accident rate worldwide has fallen from about four accidents per million flights in 1977 to less than 0.4 today. Pilots today, as one former pilot puts it, are less stick-and-rudder movers than they are overseers of systems.

Automation is not without its own hazards, though. As it has become ubiquitous in cockpits, automation-related accidents have come to make up a significant proportion of all air disasters. In 2013, the Federal Aviation Administration published a study of accidents over the previous two decades and found that reports of “unexpected or unexplained” behavior of automated systems were present in 46 percent of the accident reports and 60 percent of the major incident reports collected by the researchers.

There are two main ways in which automation can lead to catastrophe. Sometimes a malfunction causes the autopilot to run haywire and put the plane into a dangerous state. This is what seems to have happened to the Lion Air 737 Max that crashed last October shortly after takeoff from Jakarta, Indonesia. (It may have occurred in the case of Sunday’s Ethiopian Airlines crash as well; on Wednesday, the F.A.A. said that newly available satellite data “indicates some similarities” between the two accidents.)

Because the 737 Max had been outfitted with larger new engines that could cause its nose to pitch dangerously skyward, Boeing had added a maneuvering characteristics augmentation system, or M.C.A.S., that would kick in and push the nose down if necessary. But a faulty sensor fed incorrect information to the Lion Air flight’s M.C.A.S., causing it to put the plane into a steep dive. Pilots on at least two flights in the United States reported similar problems, but in those cases they were able to disengage the autopilot system and recover control of the plane.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>It bears some resemblance, too, to the now-vintage fears of back-masked satanic messaging in rock music, a phenomenon that likewise became more common only after the broader culture had begun panicking about it. The satanic music panic is understood by moralizing critics and worried parents alike as the corruption of children animated as much by commercial motives as by ill will or evil. YouTube, in 2019, is seen as ubiquitous, powerful and also untamed. It’s a business that can’t, for example, seem to deal with a highly visible Nazi problem. Awful videos have found their way onto YouTube Kids, repeatedly. The company just announced it has “disabled comments from tens of millions of videos that could be subject to predatory behavior,” meaning, essentially, videos portraying children. A pro-vaccine nonprofit said it had long ago written off YouTube because its videos were overwhelmed with anti-vaccine content and recommendations. That YouTube is simultaneously one of the largest and most accessible hubs for children’s entertainment is, for a parent, disorienting to say the least.

YouTube is, in 2019, a rare space in which children can roam. It’s also completely commercialized, and, to a parent’s eye, stocked almost exclusively with choppy cuts of generically alarming images. A clip that puts children into a trance and seems to program them to do or say things? That’s not a clip in the middle of a Peppa Pig video — that’s the Peppa Pig video itself. A third party contacting a wide-eyed viewer with instructions to do something in the real world? That’s not a killer pretending to be Momo. That’s how advertising works on YouTube.

Last week, YouTube told reporters: “Contrary to press reports, we’ve not received any recent evidence of videos showing or promoting the Momo challenge on YouTube.”

But YouTube isn’t lacking as a source of psychological horror. Screens and screen time are a source of endless guilt and frustration among parents today, and it makes sense to need to displace these feelings on a face, a character, and something, or someone, with fantastically evil motives, rather than on the services that actually are surveilling what the kids are up to, to ends of their own. YouTube is where their unsupervised time might include the sudden appearance of, for example, a bunch of children chanting “baby shark” over and over again, cursing them, and eventually their parents, and the broader culture, with a nightmarish earworm which, seven days in, might at least have them wishing a shark would wriggle through the screen and eat them alive.

Momo is, as a former colleague and mother of a young child put it to me, only half-joking, “the face of a mom who hasn’t slept or showered” for lack of a moment away from a needy child. She is, like all of us, unable to know or grasp quite what a service like YouTube — or WhatsApp, or Fortnite — wants from or is doing to anyone, much less the youngest among us, but who very much isn’t ready, or able, to take it away completely.

The Momo Challenge may not be real, but Momo is more than a hoax or panic. She’s a pretty smart work of group fiction written in the grip of a pretty dumb panic, an avatar for a collective spirit that is less vengeful than guilty, anxious and helplessly angry. She, or at least her franchise, will be with us for a while.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>VALLE DE LA PASCUA, Venezuela — Sporadic looting and spontaneous protests. Desperate patients begging doctors to be kept alive. Residents bracing for wider attacks on markets and restaurants after the sun goes down.

Sunday was the fourth day since Venezuela’s power system went down, plunging most of the country, including Caracas, the capital, into sporadic darkness and dampening hopes of imminent resolution to a devastating blackout that has brought the country to the verge of social implosion.

“We’re going to arrive at a moment when we’re going to eat each other,” said Zuly González, 40, a resident of Caracas’s Chacao neighborhood.

The blackout is the latest crisis to befall a country in seemingly perpetual crisis. Venezuela has been devastated for years by hyperinflation and a failing economy that has led millions to flee. But the country has been further torn since January, when opposition political leaders refused to acknowledge as legitimate the re-election of President Nicolás Maduro.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>It was the first time the Swiss had been able to see Mr. White since he was seized in Mashhad last July and taken to Vakilabad Prison, after having visited a person his family has described as an Iranian girlfriend. He has still not been able to communicate directly with his family.

Mr. White, 47, of Imperial Beach, Calif., served in the Navy for 13 years. He is the first American to be incarcerated in Iran since President Trump took office in 2017, adding a complication to what already was a severely strained relationship between the United States and Iran.

He is one of at least four Americans known to be held in Iran, where the government has regarded the United States as its top enemy since the Islamic revolution that overthrew the shah 40 years ago.

“Over the past few weeks,” Ms. White said, “I’ve learned that Mike was badly beaten when he was arrested and that he has been taken to court at least twice for proceedings in Farsi that he couldn’t understand. My son is not well. His health is deteriorating, and I want him back so I can get him the care he badly needs.”

Alireza Miryousefi, a spokesman for Iran’s United Nations Mission, confirmed in an email that the Swiss had met with Mr. White and that another meeting was planned in “coming days.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Moscow will probably choose to continue with its campaign of disinformation and disruption against American democracy, he said in an interview. “It is difficult to imagine that relations can get better now,” he said. “So that means that the Kremlin will try to continue with the hybrid war and also attempt to push this event out of the Russian-American agenda with the help of some new ones.”

Analysts of all stripes said that without the cloud of the Mueller investigation over him, Mr. Trump might return to his idea of a grand bargain with Mr. Putin, something he had appeared to put on the back burner as the accusations swirled.

“Now he can say this is my political plan and not the result of any wrongdoing,” said Ivan I. Kurilla, a historian at the European University at St. Petersburg who specializes in Russian-American relations.

Whether that will be enough to clear a path for Mr. Trump is another matter. The Kremlin is cautious about his mercurial moods, and Democrats will continue to challenge the president over Russian actions, particularly the election meddling described by Mr. Mueller.

“He is not seen as a reliable partner for Russia,” said Dmitri Trenin, the head of the Carnegie Moscow Center. “Russia will continue to be what it has been for the last two years in the United States, a political football kicked around by all sides.”

Mr. Kurilla said there was a panoply of issues on which talks could at least get started, ranging from smaller disputes like the recent mutual expulsion of diplomats and closing of consulates to larger issues like the war in Ukraine, arms control or the situation in Venezuela.

Compared with the summit meetings that Mr. Trump has held with the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, Mr. Putin may seem a far more important, more tempting target, he said.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Canceling Michael Jackson, it seems, may not be so easy.

Since HBO’s broadcast last week of “Leaving Neverland” — a two-part, four-hour spotlight on two men who said Mr. Jackson had abused them when they were young boys — reams of commentary have been devoted to whether fans could ever listen to “Off the Wall” or “Thriller” again in good conscience.

But the numbers show that, at least so far, the popularity of Mr. Jackson’s music has not budged.

Since the beginning of the year, songs from Mr. Jackson’s solo catalog have been streamed 16 million to 17 million times each week in the United States on services like Spotify, Apple Music and Tidal, according to Nielsen. Last week, including the period immediately after the documentary’s premiere on March 3 and 4, the total was 16,497,000 streams.

Even the daily listening pattern did not vary since the HBO documentary was shown. On the two days of the “Leaving Neverland” premiere, a Sunday and a Monday, Mr. Jackson’s streaming numbers dipped below his typical daily average of about 2.3 million — but that was in line with the usual streaming pattern of his songs, which tends to peak in the middle of the week.

In the three days after the film, those numbers climbed back up. By Thursday — the last day for which complete information is available — they had risen to 2.5 million. Particularly popular, as always, were hits like “Beat It,” “Billie Jean” and “Thriller.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The two men mix rage with self-pity. They see themselves as victims and use terms like “invasion,” “mass immigration” and “white genocide” to describe what they regard as the destruction of Europe and the white race. Both the Australian and the Norwegian barely mention their own homelands and focus on Europe and the United States. Mr. Tarrant sees the white population of Australia and New Zealand as Europeans.

He writes how he decided on his “final push” after visiting France in 2017, where he saw how the European French had been “replaced” by “nonwhites.” Thus the title of his manifesto: “The Great Replacement.”

Like the Norwegian, Mr. Tarrant is obsessed with birthrates and describes Europe as growing weaker and older. The Norwegian terrorist wanted to establish state-run birth clinics where blond, blue-eyed mothers would give birth to a dozen children each. Mr. Tarrant wants to restore what he calls “traditional family values.”

Even though Mr. Tarrant’s manifesto is tailored to his dark web audience, sometimes with coded language, he tries to create a background of normalcy by quoting poems by Rudyard Kipling and referring to more mainstream right-wing figures. Likewise, Mr. Breivik frequently quoted people like Thomas Jefferson, as if he were the rightful heir to well-established ideas.

Their main agenda is the same: to crush Muslim immigration. Mr. Tarrant wants to “deport those invaders already living on our soil.” Mr. Breivik suggested that every Muslim should be given the opportunity to convert to Christianity and take a Christian name. Those who do not obey should be deported or executed. All examples of Islamic art should be destroyed including all mosques; languages like Arabic, Persian, Urdu and Somali would be banned.

One of the mosques targeted in New Zealand is built on the site where a church once stood. While the Christchurch gunman aimed straight at his targets, Mr. Breivik wanted to kill the so-called traitors, the members of the liberal elite and ruling Labour Party who had let Muslims into the country.

Both men wrote about sacrificing themselves to a greater cause and envisioned that they would be released from prison by their followers after a “conservative revolution”swept through the world.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Let’s go back and look at the indictments and guilty pleas. George Papadopoulos, a campaign official who had contacts with individuals who said the Russians were going to be releasing information about Hillary Clinton’s emails before it came out. When George Papadopoulos pleads guilty, he does not plead guilty to conspiring with the Russians. He pleads guilty to making false statements to investigators about that contact. The president’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, has these odd phone calls with the Russian ambassador during the transition in which they discuss lifting sanctions that have just been imposed by the Obama administration for election meddling. When Mike Flynn goes into court to plead guilty, he doesn’t plead guilty to conspiring with the Russians. He pleads guilty to making false statements to the F.B.I. about it. So as we went along in the investigation over the past 22 months, we never saw charges that said that the campaign conspired with Russia. There was some question — was Mueller holding out something like that until the end? Was he going to wait and then make a move on it? Well, today, we know that they never found anything.

I think there’s two reasons why the Justice Department would not want to bring a case like this. The first is that if there’s not an underlying crime, then do you really want to bring an obstruction case? Do you really want to go to court to try and convince a jury that someone took actions where there was nothing to cover up? I think that’s a tough case to make. The second thing is that while the president huffed and puffed a lot about this investigation, I’m not sure how much real damage it did to it. Bob Mueller was able to pursue his inquiry. He was not fired. They finished what they had. They weren’t impeded by the Justice Department. So what was the real damage? If the president was obstructing, how did he really hurt the investigation? Give me the damage report. And I don’t think at the end of the day there was that much that actually hurt Mueller’s team’s ability to do their job. It may have been loud, it may have been annoying, it may have been dispiriting. But I think they were able to pursue what they needed to.

Well, there were legitimate issues and questions that had to be answered. And along the way, the president took action after action that only made the perception that he did something wrong worse. He fired the F.B.I. director. He asked the F.B.I. director to end an investigation into whether his former national security adviser was talking improperly to the Russian ambassador. He said things publicly about the investigation time and time again to demonize the investigators. He criticized his own attorney general, who recused himself from the Russia investigation. He called Mueller’s team a bunch of angry Democrats. He made the perception worse. And there were things that he did that walked up to the line of obstruction and had to be looked at, that had to be sorted through. Whether it was to clear the president and say, hey, look, he did nothing wrong, for his sake, or to give the public some confidence that the president of the United States was not a Russian agent.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>It’s not easy to be a songwriter in the pop world these days. Listeners rarely see your name. For anything but a giant hit, royalties from streaming are infinitesimal — and big tech companies seem to want to keep it that way.

And then there’s the shadow of “Blurred Lines.”

Four years after the copyright trial over that No. 1 song — in which Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams, its primary writers, were ordered to pay more than $5 million for copying Marvin Gaye’s disco-era hit “Got to Give It Up” — the case still looms over the music industry and individual songwriters, who were left to wonder when homage bleeds into plagiarism.

Intellectual property lawyers and music executives interviewed for this article said the case had fueled a rise in copyright claims. In September, Ed Sheeran will go to court to defend “Thinking Out Loud,” a Grammy-winning song that has been accused of mimicking another Gaye classic, “Let’s Get It On.” Two years ago, Mr. Sheeran settled another suit by giving up part of his ownership in the Top 10 hit “Photograph,” which was accused of having similarities to “Amazing,” a song by the British singer-songwriter Matt Cardle.

The aftereffects of the “Blurred Lines” decision — which was upheld on appeal last year — have been felt most acutely by rank-and-file songwriters, who work in obscurity even as their creations propel others to stardom. The ramifications for them have been inescapable, affecting royalty splits, legal and insurance costs, and even how songs are composed.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Our understanding is that the attorney general and his deputies now have a long weekend of reading ahead of them. They have to go through the report, see what’s there, digest it, and then figure out what to do with it. How much of it should be made public, how much of it should be given to Congress, and how much of it should remain secret.

Barr is in this incredibly difficult spot, because he has to figure out how much information to share with the public and Congress in a way that is enough to leave people convinced that this investigation was done thoroughly and based on following the facts. But he has to protect the president from disclosures about him that the public may be interested in, that his political enemies may want to know, but that has no bearing on the actual criminal investigation that was done.

Yes. If Mueller says the president didn’t break the law, then Barr has to figure out how much information to give to Congress so that Congress takes those findings seriously. The problem is Barr is in a very difficult spot politically, because the Democrats have already concluded the president did something wrong. So if Barr learns from Mueller that there’s no criminality on the president, how does Barr then win over those Democrats and show them that Mueller truly made a decision based on the facts? How much of what the investigation found does he have to give to the Hill? In a normal criminal investigation, all of that information would not become public because the Justice Department would want to protect the individual who they have found did not commit a crime. But this situation is different, because a lot of people do think the president committed a crime. So how do you show the Democrats and the rest of the country that hey, look, this is what Mueller found. He only found X, Y, and Z. And if we wanted to make a case, he would have needed to have uncovered these other things, which he did not. And that’s why we’re confident with his findings.

Well, how much of the evidence that Mueller uncovered should go to Congress? What should be told to Congress? Should Congress be told explicitly, look, Mueller believes the president violated these laws, and here’s the evidence to back it up? But what if some of that evidence has been obtained from a grand jury? The Justice Department can’t just hand over grand jury information to Congress. What if the information is classified? They’re not going to want to hand over classified information to Congress. They think Congress leaks like a sieve.

When will we know more? Barr and his deputies will go through this, and I don’t know — sometime in the next few days, sometime in the next few weeks. It may be a difficult process to unbraid. Mueller has been rummaging around the president’s life for 22 months. We don’t have clarity into everything Mueller’s found. What if Barr looks at it and says, eh, Mueller thinks he violated this law and that law. But actually, I don’t think he has it. Maybe there’s not enough there. Maybe Barr disagrees with what Mueller has found, simply on a legal basis. The other thing is that Barr only really gets one shot to get it right. Whatever he goes out the door with in terms of handing over information to Congress, he’s got to have it right. He’s not going to have a second chance to say, well, you know, I gave you that stuff. But like, meh, maybe it’s not what I thought it was. Or, oh, let’s give you more. He has to get it right the first time. Otherwise, he’ll look like he’s waffling.

Barr clearly knows Congress is going to jump up and down until it is satisfied with the information that it wants about this investigation. He can drag that out and probably lose it one way or another, either in the court of public opinion or in the actual courts. So he probably just wants to get it over with as soon as possible. He knows this has been an enormous weight on the country, and that the sooner it is resolved, the sooner the country can move on.

I don’t know. I mean, the number of people who will have access to this document will be very small. And they will know that if there are a lot of leaks about this, then the president can start to raise questions about what’s really going on. It will look nefarious. The Democrats will get their backs up and say, well, if this stuff is leaking out, why can’t we have access to it? They will know that their lives will be much more difficult if there are leaks here. Obviously, you could come up with a scenario where someone working on the investigation is frustrated that the Justice Department has decided to go one way or the other on the report, and they think, ah, screw it, I’m going to make this public. But my guess is they have gone to great lengths to ensure that this is heavily protected.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Other works have tweaked the rules of physics and the values underpinning our economic and political systems. As part of a 2013 outdoor group exhibition at City Hall Park in New York, she exhibited a Raleigh bike that had been bent into a perfect — and impossible — circle so that the front and back tires met. Ken Johnson, writing in The New York Times, noted that “Journey without arrival (Raleigh)” had “a nice, counterintuitive simplicity, like a three-dimensional koan.” In an older conceptual piece commenting on luxury and capitalism, she once had nearly 5,000 pounds worth of champagne bottles ground into grain-sized sand and poured in a conical pile.

Lisa Spellman, whose 303 Gallery represents Ms. Kwade in New York, described her in an email as “one of the most important artists of our time” and noted that “her work has become increasingly ambitious and elaborate over the years, in both scale and content.”

The artist said the biggest challenges in creating “ParaPivot” were logistical. Because lifting the sculptures to the roof by crane would have been prohibitively expensive, they had to be painstakingly moved through the building’s hallways and brought up by elevator.

Bernd Euler, a Berlin art-producer whose team built the piece, said over the phone that they had to use a system of chains and a forklift to maneuver the spherical stones, some of which measured over three feet in diameter. Mr. Euler, who has worked with Ms. Kwade for years, described her as very “exact” and “whatever the positive word is for ‘pedantic.’”

Despite the sculptures’ abstract qualities, Ms. Baum said that the work offers a salient commentary on our current moment. “She wants us to engender distrust for the systems and rules which we rely on too passively.”

Her lesson may be taken to heart on the roof of the Met. “ParaPivot’s” visual interactions with the Manhattan skyline, Ms. Kwade said, were partly inspired by the fact that the city’s skyscrapers were symbols of a capitalist system she views with mistrust. From certain angles, she explained, the sculpture’s spherical rocks will look as if they are perched on the surrounding buildings, so that “capitalism becomes a pedestal for the globe.”</TEXT>

      <TITLE>Opinion | The Democrats Are Confused on Immigration - The New York Times</TITLE>

      <TEXT>Among the questions that I’d like Democrats to answer:
• None What kind of border security do you believe in? Do you favor the policies Obama put in place to reduce illegal immigration — or a different approach?
• None Do you believe that immigrants who enter this country illegally should be allowed to stay? If not, which categories of undocumented immigrants should be at risk of deportation? (In a 2016 debate, Clinton and Sanders didn’t offer clear answers when Univision’s Jorge Ramos asked similar questions.)
• None What do you believe should happen to future levels of legal immigration? And what should happen to the mix of different categories of immigration? Should family connections play as large a role as they now do? Should workplace skills continue to play a small role?
• None Do you believe, as Sanders suggested in 2015, that more immigration can reduce wages , especially for lower-income workers and recent immigrants themselves?

My own view is that the country benefits from significant limits on immigration. As David Frum notes in a recent cover story for The Atlantic, immigration levels were quite low for much of the 20th century — from roughly the 1910s through the 1970s.

The slowdown helped many of the immigrants who arrived in the waves before 1910 (including parts of my family). They faced less competition in the labor market. Labor unions were more easily able to grow, because they were organizing an increasingly assimilated workforce. The immigration slowdown played a role in the great income surge of the post-World War II decades.

Today, I’d favor a policy with a lot of similarities to the Democrats’ platform of the Obama years, including humane treatment of immigrants already here plus tight border security. I’d change the mix of immigration, to let in fewer low-skills immigrants and more high-skills immigrants. Doing so has the potential to reduce inequality and lift economic growth.

I recognize that this platform is probably too conservative for many Democrats. But high levels of immigration, stretching over many decades, is not an American tradition. It’s something new, and it brings both upsides and downsides.

For anyone who wants to think through the subject, I recommend Frum’s article. (The politician quotations above come from it.) For critiques of Frum’s piece, see Nancy LeTourneau in Washington Monthly and Noah Smith of Bloomberg Opinion.

If nothing else, I’d urge Democrats to look at public opinion on immigration with an open mind. The polling isn’t as favorable as some of the recent conversation on the left has suggested. In a recent Gallup poll, 47 percent of Americans called illegal immigration a critical threat and another 30 percent called it an important threat.

I wouldn’t call it either of those. But I do think it’s folly — both substantively and politically — to pretend that more immigration is always better than less. And I think it’s a mistake for Democrats to be so unclear about what their party’s immigration agenda is.

      <TEXT>And now this very silly supernatural romantic comedy exists. I thought about my friends, who wrote and directed this lonely ghost-talking driving instructor movie, when I watched the comedian Chelsea Peretti host the Writers Guild Awards last month. “Every woman is obsessed with procuring a flipped role — a role that’s good that’s written for a guy and then they just name it Esmerelda” she said. Why not just write a good role for a woman, she asked the roomful of nervously grinning writers in formal wear. “Is that too kooky? Here’s a simple way to do it if you’re struggling — you know how you like guys? Just imagine you liked women.” The laughter that followed had a wince to it, because of the truth in the joke.

I’m not claiming to be the first to deliberately set aside self-consciousness in order to focus on the funny. Many women have cast off expectations and inhibitions and gone straight for the laughs.

“Muriel’s Wedding,” starring a gauche and hilarious Toni Collette, is my gold standard. I’m a Natasha Rothwell fangirl, and while she is a hugely successful creator and writer with a strong political voice in Hollywood, she also plays Kelli on HBO’s “Insecure,” the one who makes me laugh out loud with her buoyant silliness and generosity. In Tina Fey’s memoir, “Bossypants,” Ms. Fey recalls a time when Amy Poehler, new to “Saturday Night Live,” was doing a goofy bit in the writers’ room. Jimmy Fallon interrupted her and said: “Stop that! It’s not cute! I don’t like it.” Ms. Fey describes what happened next: “Amy dropped what she was doing, went black in the eyes for a second, and wheeled around on him.” She told him, forcefully, that she didn’t care whether he liked it.

But enough about them; back to me. I’ve been feeling very important because I’m in a movie. Earlier this year, I emailed my agent to ask something: I’m the lead, so I’ll be on the poster, right? He said he’d check, and then the email trail went cold, which always means the answer is not the one I want. Weeks later, I saw the poster. I’m not on it — there’s just a ghost peeking out of a garbage bin. I laughed a lot when I saw that.

I take myself too seriously, probably because I’m a human being. With our big brains and our bigger egos, we can’t help building the case to ourselves and others that we are very important creatures, when really we’re ludicrous. To be funny is to remind ourselves again and again just how ridiculous we are.

      <TEXT>The last half-hour was devoted to splitting off into groups and performing the combination a few times, then together as a class. “Inclusive” is an overused word these days, but it’s the best way to describe the feeling of the class. It felt low stakes in a joyous way. If the worst thing that happened was that you forgot a sequence, it was of no consequence.

The class ended at 10 p.m., and I was so charged with adrenaline that I couldn’t get to sleep until long after midnight. I wanted more.

So I went to Ballet1, an all-levels ballet-based movement class. Its founder is Eva Alt, a former dancer with the Boston Ballet Company and BalletMet who is now the social media editor of Glossier. After she quit dancing professionally five years ago, she struggled to find a class that was less about technique and more about community and having a good time. She found it, as I did, at Moves, and started Ballet1 in April 2018.

On a cold February night, also at Gibney in TriBeCa, there were about 30 dancers at Ballet1, some dressed in leotards and ballet slippers, others in basketball shorts or leggings and socks. We began at the barre with traditional warm-up combinations of pliés and tendus and stretches. Then we went to the back of the room to practice, in sets of two, follow-along movements like balletic running and leaps.

For the second half of the class, Ms. Alt encouraged us to put sneakers on for the piece she had choreographed. “I like the sounds they make,” she said, pounding her Nike-clad foot to “Les Filles Désir” by Vendredi sur Mer.

She demonstrated turns and strides alongside another dancer, Emily Rose, a lithe redhead who danced with Ms. Alt in Boston and is studying at Columbia. We performed the choreography in small groups, clapping and hooting enthusiastically for one another, and then all together before taking the traditional révérence, a dramatic bow at the end.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>He decided to strike out on his own as a producer in the late 1990s, forming a studio with the producer David Janollari — with financial backing from 20th Century Fox, thanks to Mr. Chernin. In that role, he squired a few network shows and had a critically acclaimed hit with “Six Feet Under,” Alan Ball’s darkly comic funeral-home series. It lasted five seasons on HBO and won the Golden Globe for best television drama in 2002.

“I felt the HBO glow way back then,” Mr. Greenblatt said.

He rejoined the executive ranks at Showtime, where Mr. Chernin had worked in the 1980s. “When I was at Showtime we were, of course, in the shadow of HBO,” Mr. Greenblatt said.

At the time, HBO was known for gritty, male antiheroes like Tony Soprano. Showtime went in a slightly different direction under Mr. Greenblatt, programming shows like “Weeds” with Mary Louise-Parker and “Nurse Jackie” with Edie Falco. A personal favorite for Mr. Greenblatt was “Dexter,” starring the former “Six Feet Under” star Michael C. Hall. Showtime became a serious home for original programming on his watch, with the number of subscribers rising to 19 million, a 52 percent jump over his tenure there.

In 2010, as NBC was trying to recover from the decision to replace its 10 p.m. dramas with a nightly Jay Leno talk show, Comcast was closing on its purchase of NBC Universal. When Comcast executives were looking for a new entertainment head, Mr. Chernin suggested his protégé.

Mr. Greenblatt orchestrated a turnaround at NBC, taking it from last place to first among viewers 18 to 49 years old, who are prized by advertisers. At the network, he followed the strategy that he has relied on throughout his career: find a difference-maker. At Fox, it was programming teen-friendly soaps when no one else was doing them. At Showtime, it was a new twist on the antihero. At NBC, it was “The Voice,” the uplifting hug-in of a show that struck a new note in a genre dominated by the acerbic “American Idol.” And it was not such a big jump from the heartwarming qualities of “The Voice” to the unapologetically emotional NBC hit “This Is Us.”

Mr. Greenblatt also made live musicals an unexpected force on broadcast television, with NBC’s productions of “The Sound of Music,” “The Wiz,” “Hairspray” and “Jesus Christ Superstar,” a winner of five Emmys. And he showed off his musical chops at an NBC presentation for advertisers, accompanying Ms. Parton on piano for a performance of her song “I Will Always Love You.”

When Mr. Greenblatt left the network last September, he had his piano — an 1898 Steinway grand, with ivory keys, which he bought at age 20 — moved from his NBC office to his home. But he wasn’t through with show business, saying at the time that he would love to run a company. Once again, his mentor stepped in.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared on Wednesday that China is “in a league of its own when it comes to human rights violations,” and one of his top officials compared Beijing’s roundup of Muslim minorities to movements into camps not seen “since the 1930s.”

The official, Michael Kozak, who heads the State Department’s human rights bureau, did not explicitly mention Nazi Germany or the creation of concentration camps, but that was clearly the comparison he was making.

Taken together, the statements amounted to the most direct condemnation the United States has made to the roundup of millions of Uighurs and other minorities. The charge is bound to inflame the government in Beijing at a moment of high tension in trade talks and the standoff over Huawei, the Chinese communications giant seeking to operate in many Western markets.

The detention camps in China’s western Xinjiang region have expanded since 2017 to include an estimated one million Uighurs, Kazakhs and other Muslims in a program that tries to turn them into loyal supporters of the Chinese government. The camps have been broadly condemned, including by the United Nations, but China has brushed off the criticism; one official as recently as Tuesday likened them to “boarding schools where the students eat and live for free.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“We’re going to move forward with our investigation into obstruction of justice, abuses of power, corruption, to defend the rule of law, which is our job,” Mr. Nadler told reporters in New York afterward. “It’s a broader mandate than the special prosecutor has. His mandate is only for crimes.”

Mr. Nadler said he rejected Mr. Trump’s claim of vindication, and zeroed in on Mr. Barr, whom he described as having prejudged the matter of obstruction.

“He auditioned for his job by writing a 19-page memorandum giving a very extreme view of obstruction of justice in presidential power and saying basically no president can commit obstruction of justice,” Mr. Nadler said, referring to a memo Mr. Barr wrote in June 2018 about executive authority. Mr. Nadler pledged to use every tool at his disposal to gain access to the full report and evidence — the public release of which Mr. Barr said Sunday raised challenges given grand jury and other sensitive information.

Mr. Nadler’s committee is not the only one scrutinizing the president and his administration. Since they took control of the House, Democrats have been investigating Mr. Trump’s businesses, his role in hush money payments during the campaign to a pornographic film actress who claimed to have had an affair with him, accusations of corruption in various federal agencies and other topics.

“I don’t know that any of our investigations depended on the red herring concept of collusion between the Trump campaign and Putin’s forces,” Representative Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat and former constitutional law professor, said in an interview, referring to a series of ongoing investigations into numerous aspects of the Trump White House and Mr. Trump’s businesses.

The collusion theory is the basis, at least in part, for the House Intelligence Committee’s own investigation of Russian election interference, and it was less clear on Sunday how Democrats leading that panel would incorporate Mr. Mueller’s definitive conclusion that there had been no conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia to undermine the 2016 election. Then again, the committee’s chairman, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, had in a sense already built in a response, framing his inquiry as not just about Russia, but any other foreign powers that could have financial or other leverage over Mr. Trump and his associates.

At least on the question of impeachment — a constitutional remedy so grave it has been pursued seriously against a president only twice in modern American history — the outlook appeared to be clearer. Mr. Nadler and Ms. Pelosi, students of the failed Republican attempt to remove Bill Clinton from office in the 1990s, have warned repeatedly that they would not go down that path unaccompanied by Republicans.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Representative José E. Serrano, who is currently the nation’s longest-tenured Hispanic congressman, said on Monday that he would not run for re-election, citing the effects of Parkinson’s disease.

Mr. Serrano, who has served in Congress since 1990 and represents the southern Bronx, one of the poorest districts in the country, has repeatedly won re-election with more than 90 percent of the vote. But with the Democratic Party seeking a younger brand of progressives, there was talk that he might have faced a serious primary challenge next year.

Two powerful members of the Bronx political establishment praised Mr. Serrano while predicting a wide open race for his seat; Ritchie Torres, a Bronx councilman often described as a rising star, said last month that he was exploring a primary challenge to Mr. Serrano.

“I’m sure there will be a lot of people who are now going to want to run for Congress,” said Carl E. Heastie, the Bronx assemblyman who serves as speaker of the State Assembly. “And I will not be one of them.”</TEXT>

As a longtime “Jeopardy!” devotee (and enthusiastic volunteer “Alex” at college trivia events), I was left with a heavy heart upon hearing the news of Alex Trebek’s illness. His poignant video announcement was in keeping with the charm, folksiness, good humor and decency that have characterized his 35 years as host .

Alex, many have beaten the odds, but none of them with the adoration and love of the millions of strangers who invite you into their homes every evening. We’re all pulling for your contract to be extended long past the current 2022 !</TEXT>

      <TEXT>This climate hasn’t just offended us; it’s making our ability to communicate and share experiences with Americans more difficult. Take the example of Leonid Volkov, an opposition political operative who went to the United States last year as part of the Yale World Fellows program. In a blog post he wrote while there, he described his frustration while trying to monitor the midterm elections to gain insight for his own campaigns in Russia. The very idea of a Russian volunteering for an American political campaign is today so toxic, Mr. Volkov wrote, that he had to abandon his plan.

In the atmosphere where “contacts with Russians” has become cause for suspicion, every bank transaction and visa application faces extra scrutiny. I’ve heard from people I know about how exchange programs, conferences and businesses are suffering.

To those of us who paid attention to American media and politics over the past two years, it quickly became clear that too many in the United States know nothing about our country. Ominous images of onion-shaped domes taking over the White House baffled us; St. Basil’s Cathedral is not part of the Kremlin complex and has no political connotation. The ubiquity of hammers and sickles in visuals accompanying Trump-Russia reports seemed likewise absurd. Our country hasn’t been Communist for about 30 years.

We have few illusions about our own government, its dirty dealings abroad or our own toxic media. But we expected better of America.

Oleg Kashin, a prominent Russian journalist, wrote in a 2017 op-ed essay that “every time a Russian television network or pro-Kremlin newspaper reaches a new low, it was once commonplace among independent thinkers to say that the Western media giants never allowed themselves such mistakes.” That’s much harder to do now.

The end of the Mueller investigation and the conclusion that the Trump campaign didn’t collude with Russia may allow Washington and Moscow to begin to try to fix diplomatic and business relations. I’d be glad to see that. But my perception of the United States’ politics and media might have suffered irreparable damage as a result of #Russiagate, and I’m afraid that’s the case for many people like me. Robert Mueller can’t fix that.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“This young girl was forced to face not one abuser, but two, who were working together, for seven years,” Mr. Shapiro said in a recorded statement. “Thank you to this survivor in this case, who bravely shared her truth and will bring her abusers to justice.”

Weissport is a small borough in Carbon County on the eastern side of the state, nestled between the Lehigh Canal and the Lehigh River. It is home to about 400 people. Mr. Getz was hired as a part-time officer for Weissport in 2017 and promoted to the chief of police in February, according to local news reports. The department is tiny, consisting of just one officer as recently as 2016.

It is unclear how many are on the force now. Neither the mayor nor the police department immediately responded to requests for comment on Wednesday evening, and borough council members could not be reached.

When the girl first reported the abuse to her teacher in 2012, she said she had been abused by Mr. Wagner, who was then 22, multiple times, according to the attorney general’s statement. The teacher went to the Franklin Township Police Department, which opened an investigation.

But for reasons that remain unclear, no charges were filed at the time. The Franklin Township police did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday evening.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Good Monday morning. Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today.
• Support for legal recreational marijuana has become a unifying policy in the 2020 Democratic primary. But it’s not an appeal to the stoner vote — the issue is a litmus test for candidates’ commitment to equal treatment for all races in criminal justice.
• Tucked between St. Patrick’s Day greetings and criticism of “Saturday Night Live,” President Trump demonstrated that not even death provides a respite from his wrath on Twitter, as he unleashed attacks on the recently deceased Senator John McCain.
• Who is Cindy Yang? She once owned the Florida massage parlor where the owner of the New England Patriots was arrested in a prostitution sting. She was active in groups backed by the Chinese government. She promised rich Chinese clients access to the social scene around Mr. Trump. And, a Times investigation has found, she raised over $50,000 in donations for the president.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WASHINGTON — “Wonder Woman,” the 2017 film that Steven Mnuchin helped produce before becoming Treasury secretary, hauled in about $90 million at the box office in China. It was the film’s most successful international market and a roaring success for an American superhero export. But because of China’s strict laws for foreign films, the studio behind the movie, Warner Bros., received just a small fraction of those revenues.

Now, as Treasury secretary and one of the lead negotiators in trade talks with China, Mr. Mnuchin has been personally pushing Beijing to give the American film industry greater access to its markets — a change that could be highly lucrative to his former industry. While Mr. Mnuchin divested from his Hollywood film production company after joining the Trump administration, he maintains ties to the industry through his wife, the actress and filmmaker Louise Linton.

In 2017, Mr. Mnuchin sold his interest in the company, StormChaser Partners, to Ms. Linton, who at the time was his fiancée. In his 2018 disclosure, which was obtained from the Treasury Department through a records request by The New York Times, StormChaser is listed as one of Ms. Linton’s assets.

Since they are now married, government ethics rules consider the asset to be owned by Mr. Mnuchin. And while the documents show that Mr. Mnuchin sold his stake to Ms. Linton for $1 million to $2 million, he is now owed that same amount, in addition to interest, from StormChaser in 2026, according to the 2018 form.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>[music] Tel Aviv. As Israel grows more nationalist, Tel Aviv is the last stronghold of our nation’s liberals. It is a supercool cosmopolitan city and the place I call home. In 2016, I decided to say goodbye to Tel Aviv and spend the summer with the Israelis that I disagree with the most: the settlers. Since Israel’s ongoing military occupation of the West Bank that started in 1967, Jewish settlers have moved to the Palestinian territories into settlements that are illegal, according to the international law. As Israeli society polarizes around views of the occupation, I found myself increasingly curious about Israelis my age who grew up in those settlements, who were born into this reality. I ended up in one of the oldest Israeli settlements, called Tekoa, which was founded in 1977. About an hour drive from Tel Aviv, it is a world apart, isolated in the Judean hills and surrounded by Palestinian villages. I rented a small apartment on the corner of Hospitality Road and Joy Street. And I thought to myself, these are two things I’ll definitely need here. After all, it’s not every day that a liberal from Tel Aviv moves to a settlement. Once I settled in, to make myself feel more at home, I set up a small cafe and waited for company. Well, apparently coffee is not in demand in Tekoa, as well as a liberal with three cameras. For a while, it seemed like the only locals who visited my table were flies, a cat, and my only new friend in town, Matanya. But being stubborn eventually paid off. Unlike Tekoa, which is considered a moderate settlement, the Jewish settlement in the Palestinian city of Hebron is the most extremist of all, where extreme settlers live in the midst of a large Palestinian city. Moriya grew up there. It seems like we grew up in totally different worlds. While I knew Palestinians come in and out of the settlements every day to work, building more of the buildings that they will never be allowed to live in, seeing them line up to enter settlements that represent their oppression with my own eyes was very unsettling. Her uncensored lack of political correctness definitely shocked me, but also made me want to hear more. Despite a peace and love and the hippie vibe of Tekoa, sometimes the complexity of the tension here slaps you in the face. My next door neighbor’s family was attacked in the shooting ambush, killing her father, and leaving her mother and two siblings wounded. Her cry and weep across our shared wall when she first got the message tore my heart apart. In January 2016, a Palestinian teenager stabbed Tekoa resident Michal Froman at the local thrift shop. She was four months pregnant at the time. Most of the people my age I chatted with were honest about the negative effect of the settlements on Palestinians, who are repressed as long as they are occupied. I wondered how they still choose to live here. On my last day in Tekoa, Matanya stopped by for a farewell chat. [music]</TEXT>

      <TEXT>ROME — Pope Francis has issued a highly anticipated law for Vatican City officials and diplomats overseas to tackle sexual abuse, setting up what is intended to be a model for the Roman Catholic Church worldwide by requiring, for the first time, that accusations be immediately reported to Vatican prosecutors.

The Vatican characterized the law — and accompanying pastoral guidelines — as a reflection of the most advanced thinking on preventing and addressing sexual abuse in the church. The law, dated March 26, calls on church authorities to listen immediately to people who say they are victims and to report any credible allegations to prosecutors.

Those who fail to report could be subjected to financial penalties and jail time.

“Protection of minors and vulnerable people is an essential part of the evangelical message that the church and all of its members are called to spread across the world.” the pope wrote in a personal edict enacting the law. Francis said he wanted to “strengthen the institutional and regulatory framework to prevent and tackle abuses against minors and vulnerable people.”

In a statement on Friday, Alessandro Gisotti, the Vatican’s spokesman, said that Pope Francis had hoped that though the measures applied to the Vatican City State and its administration, “everyone might develop in their awareness that the church must always be ever increasingly a safe home for children and vulnerable persons.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Tara Siegel Bernard, a personal finance reporter, discussed the tech she’s using.

What are your most important tech tools for tracking budgets?

This may sound strange coming from a personal finance reporter, but I’m not a big fan of traditional budgets — I don’t think they work. I try to keep my own spending in check by taking the reverse approach. Instead of tracking every dollar, I focus on what we need to save for: retirement, college or some other goal. After you’ve automated your savings goals and created a bit of a cushion for emergencies, you’re freer to spend without thinking too hard or feeling too guilty. It’s an imperfect system, but it’s better than a failed budget.

That method won’t necessarily work in all situations, especially if you need to tackle debt or establish a stricter spending plan in retirement. And everyone can benefit from tracking personal spending, even if you do it only for a few months or check in only every quarter.

Mint has been around for a while, but it is still a solid way to take stock of where all of your money is going and whether your net worth is moving in the right direction. It also allows you to create a budget, and alerts you when you’ve spent too much. I use it infrequently, and there’s usually at least one kink I need to work out whenever I log in; most recently, it counted all of my retirement accounts twice, which was kind of cruel.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Squid are chameleons of the ocean, shifting effortlessly from hue to hue as they cross sand, coral and grass. Scientists have long studied the peculiar structures in their skin that interact with light, trying to understand how the animals change color so swiftly and with such precision.

Now, a paper published last week in Nature Communications suggests that their chromatophores, previously thought to be mainly pockets of pigment embedded in their skin, are also equipped with tiny reflectors made of proteins. These reflectors aid the squid to produce such a wide array of colors, including iridescent greens and blues, within a second of passing in front of a new background. The research reveals that by using tricks found in other parts of the animal kingdom — like shimmering butterflies and peacocks — squid are able to combine multiple approaches to produce their vivid camouflage.

The researchers studied Doryteuthis pealeii, or the longfin squid, which is found in the North Atlantic Ocean and might turn up on your plate when you order calamari.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Drinking sugary beverages is associated with a slightly increased risk for early death, a new study has found.

Researchers used data from two large continuing health studies begun in the 1980s that include more than 118,000 men and women. Among many other health, behavioral and diet characteristics, the researchers collected data about their consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, including noncarbonated fruit punches, lemonades and other sugary fruit drinks.

Over about 30 years, there were 36,436 deaths. The more sugar-sweetened drinks people consumed, the higher their risk for death. After controlling for many health, behavioral and dietary characteristics, the researchers found that each additional daily 12-ounce serving of sugary drinks was associated with a 7 percent increased risk for death from any cause, a 5 percent increased risk for cancer death, and a 10 percent increased risk for death from cardiovascular disease. The study appears in the journal Circulation.

“The optimal intake of these drinks is zero,” said the lead author, Vasanti S. Malik, a research scientist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “They have no health benefits.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Hopkins said they don’t talk much during the season: They don’t need to, not as close as they are. Hopkins said he knows what Boeheim is thinking the way a son knows his father’s thoughts.

“I know he does,” Hopkins said. “I know it, I know it, I know it, I know it. I know he watches, and I know what he is saying.”

Is he still driven to make Boeheim proud?

He nodded. Yes, exactly. “Syracuse raised me,” he said. “It’s as simple as that. There’s no getting around it.”

He also knows that when Boeheim finishes his reign, speculation will increase that Hopkins will bolt for Syracuse — or maybe sooner, to another high-profile coaching job.

Hopkins put down a taco and named some coaches he admires. Boeheim, of course, at Syracuse for 42 years. Mike Krzyzewski, at Duke for 39 years. (Hopkins was a Krzyzewski assistant on Team U.S.A.’s Olympic gold medal teams in 2012 and 2016.) Mark Few, at Gonzaga, now for 20 years.

Each took a foundering program, built it to prominence and stayed for the long haul. Hopkins vowed to do the same thing in Seattle. He hopes to make his first national splash this month in the N.C.A.A. tournament. Next year’s recruiting class looks to be one of Washington’s best.

“For me, I think if there is something that I like, I stick with it,” he said. “If I like some item of clothing, I might buy two or three, and I stick with it. If I like something at a restaurant, I come back and order it again. That’s how I’m built. I would say, ‘Never say never,’ but when I came to Washington, I came to create my own legacy. That’s what is important to me.

“Build something special, with all of your thoughts and all of your dreams, and that’s what we’re doing right now.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Since 1851, obituaries in The New York Times have been dominated by white men. With Overlooked, we’re adding the stories of remarkable people whose deaths went unreported in The Times.

Isabella Goodwin’s big break came in 1912 when she took a job as a boardinghouse scrubwoman for $6 a week.

She had been hired by the New York City Police Department as a police matron, which mostly meant cleaning jail cells and supervising inmates rather than solving crimes.

But when news of a bank heist made national headlines, vexing police officials, the department asked Goodwin to pose as a maid and infiltrate a seedy boardinghouse. Her mission: Find enough evidence to arrest the suspect, a gangster named Eddie (the Boob) Kinsman, who frequented the quarters to see his sweetheart, Swede Annie.

Goodwin donned a ragged outfit, affected an Irish brogue and began snooping between scrubbing floors and cooking meals.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Ohad Naharin’s “Venezuela” starts out mysteriously, but that’s not mysterious: Being enigmatic is his way. Dancers with their backs to the audience — already it’s a little perverse — inch ahead in tiny steps as their bodies lean quietly from side to side. A woman and then a man suddenly strike a pose: She raises an arm with a wilted wrist, her other hand on her waist, elbow out. His arm and leg strike out to the side. The music is a Gregorian chant.

In “Venezuela,” there are two sides to every move. The choreography is performed for 40 minutes and then repeated with different lighting (by Avi Yona Bueno, or Bambi), music (designed and edited by Maxim Waratt, Mr. Naharin’s pseudonym) and dancers. If that initial pose has a sculptural, spiritual air in the first half, it has a raunchier Bob Fosse dimension when it returns. Pow.

So what exactly has changed? Nothing and everything, as Mr. Naharin proves in this excellent and stringent piece. Showing the same dance back to back with different elements isn’t groundbreaking — Lucy Guerin did the same with her Bessie Award-winning “Two Lies” — but it’s powerful in “Venezuela.” This stark, nuanced work is both of its own world and a reflection of the greater one.

In the production,” at the BAM Howard Gilman Opera House through Saturday, Mr. Naharin veers, to a certain extent, from the episodic track he usually takes; it’s subtle, but “Venezuela” has a more lucid flow. And while the work, performed by Batsheva Dance Company under the artistic direction of Gili Navot — Mr. Naharin, who stepped down from that post, is now the group’s house choreographer — is named after a specific place, the location onstage is more ambiguous. The world feels hard, and this is a hard, exacting work; we could be anywhere.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WASHINGTON — The still-secret report on Russian interference in the 2016 election submitted last week by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, was more than 300 pages long, the Justice Department acknowledged on Thursday.

Mr. Barr wrote to Congress on Sunday offering what he called the “principal conclusions” of the report — including that Mr. Mueller had not found that the Trump campaign had taken part in a conspiracy to undermine the election. But he had notably declined to publicly disclose its length.

The total of 300-plus pages suggests that Mr. Mueller went well beyond the kind of bare-bones summary required by the Justice Department regulation governing his appointment and detailed his conclusions at length. And it raises questions about what Mr. Barr might have left out of the four dense pages he sent to Congress.

Answering those questions is likely to prove difficult for lawmakers and the public. Mr. Barr has indicated to two congressional chairmen that it will most likely take weeks to redact the report for classified and grand jury information the department deems unfit for public consumption.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The new American spacecraft capable of carrying astronauts and built by SpaceX gently splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean on Friday morning, ending a successful demonstration trip.

“This is an amazing achievement in American history,” Jim Bridenstine, the NASA administrator, said on NASA Television afterward.

[Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.]

The mission, even though there were no astronauts aboard, was a milestone in NASA’s strategy of turning to private companies to provide trips to orbit for its astronauts. Instead of building its own vehicles, like the space shuttles that were retired in 2011, the space agency hired SpaceX and Boeing to develop commercial space systems.

Last Saturday, SpaceX was the first to launch its spacecraft, an upgraded version of the Dragon capsule that has carried cargo to the space station for years. The Crew Dragon capsule docked with the International Space Station a day later. Early on Friday, it left and after a couple of orbits of Earth, it fired its thrusters to allow Earth’s gravity to pull it down.</TEXT>

But denying Walton an opportunity to at finish out a season wrought with drama and distraction since James’s first dribble in purple and gold would be cruel and needless.

Changes are coming, though. It’s an open secret that a big off-season reset looms in Lakerland. James always knew that his new club would not be in the title mix until his second campaign as a Laker, but his patience predictably faded quickly — one more reason desperation has become so palpable around this team.

Many of us know-it-alls in the news media indeed wrote in our preseason forecasts that the playoffs were no certainty for these Lakers, as constructed, but very few of us were actually willing to outright predict that they would miss out. Reason being: It’s not very smart to bet against LeBron Raymone James.

Yet we’ve suddenly reached that unprecedented juncture where it would be wholly irresponsible to advise you that James can extricate himself from this jam just because he’s LeBron. Whether it’s the lingering effects from his groin injury, or his own unmistakably waning spirit in the face of increasingly bleak odds, James has been lacking the zip you associate with his well-chronicled playoff mode — which he assured us on Feb. 21 had been “activated” earlier than usual.

I briefly stood beside James on the floor in Charlotte, N.C., before the All-Star Game tipped off and bought into the idea a surge was coming when he insisted he was eager to embrace “the challenge” of hauling the Lakers out of their hole.

“And I’m getting healthy, too,” James said that night.

A mere two weeks later, it’s already time to start imagining the N.B.A.’s first spring without King James after watching him for eight straight Junes — and wondering how on Earth he’s going to cope with not being a part of it.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>In Flushing, where Mr. Schreiber grew up, most people had come from Brooklyn, which meant they were Dodgers fans. When the Dodgers decamped for Los Angeles in 1957, their fans were left without a team. (For many, adopting the Yankees wasn’t a viable option.)

As a child, Mr. Schreiber initially embraced the Yankees. They were the best team in baseball at the time, and their roster was riddled with famous players — Yogi Berra, Mickey Mantle, Whitey Ford. So during the Mets’ first season in 1962, Mr. Schreiber split his loyalties.

But by the end of that first year, he chose the Mets — probably because it aligned him with his father, he said.

The Mets were terrible — they lost a modern-era-record 120 games in their first season — but their antics became the stuff of legend. In 1963, Jimmy Piersall ran around the bases backward after hitting the 100th home run of his career. That same season, pitcher Roger Craig tried wearing No. 13 to break an 18-game losing streak. (It worked.)

“It was kind of rebellious to root for the worst team ever,” Mr. Schreiber recalled.

By the summer of 1969, the team’s luck had turned. That fall, as the Mets battled to win their division, Mr. Schreiber and his friends piled into his car in Buffalo, where he was attending college, so they could get out-of-town broadcasts on the radio — including one Friday-night doubleheader that the Mets swept with identical 1-0 scores. During the World Series, Mr. Schreiber and his classmates crowded into the student union to watch the games on 20-inch televisions. The Mets won the Series in five games.

For today’s sports fans, there are countless ways to relive a team’s big win including articles, commentary and replays.

After the Mets won the 1969 World Series, Mr. Schreiber wanted to read everything about the win, but he didn’t have access to all the New York City papers in Buffalo. “I really wanted to savor what we had done, but I couldn’t,” he said.

For him, this project was a chance to return to that era and savor the victory — and to bask in the joy we experience when our heroes pull off the preposterous.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Just to reassure you: Madea does not die in “A Madea Family Funeral.” That would be too much to bear. But Tyler Perry, the character’s creator and alter ego and the writer, director and producer of this movie, has said that it will be her last film appearance. (She has been in 10 previous live-action features, starting with “Diary of a Mad Black Woman” in 2005.) We’ll see how that goes — nothing in this world is more revocable than a pop-culture retirement — but the moviegoing public must prepare to let go of one of its 21st-century touchstones.

Madea belongs to the streaming services and the DVD collectors now, and also to the graduate students. A scholarly Journal of Madea Studies could feast for decades on the interpretive bounty she leaves behind. Whatever your specialty — race, gender, sex, religion, class, fashion, family, food — the granny in the floral dress with the weaponized purse will give you a lot to work with.

What Perry lacks in filmmaking rigor — like its predecessors, “Family Funeral” is a bit of a mess, formally and technically — he makes up for in generosity. The movie is the usual plateful of low humor and high melodrama, in no particular hurry to make its way through a busy plot.

This one involves the death of a briefly glimpsed patriarch named Anthony (Derek Morgan), who expires on the day of his wedding anniversary in the arms of a woman not his wife. Or to be precise, in (discreetly shown) bondage during a kinky session of hotel adultery. Coincidentally, Anthony’s older son, A.J. (Courtney Burrell), happens to be in the adjoining hotel room with a woman named Gia (Aeriél Miranda) when his dad’s heart goes. To sketch in the family tree a little further: A.J. is married to Carol (KJ Smith); Gia is engaged to A.J.’s brother, Jessie (Rome Flynn); and Anthony’s companion, Renee (Quin Walters), is an old friend of the family.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>CHICAGO — Severe floods closed highways, caused evacuations and forced a series of tense water rescues across the Midwest on Thursday as melting snow and heavy rain created dangerous conditions.

“If you choose to stay where you’re at, you’re on your own,” said Shane Weidner, the public safety director in Norfolk, Neb., where a levee system was nearing capacity and police officers had told about one-third of the city’s 24,000 residents to evacuate.

Mr. Weidner said one person was reported missing in Norfolk and a family of 10 was stranded in a home surrounded by rising waters. City officials were asking residents with airboats for their help in rescuing the family. Elsewhere in Nebraska, state officials said at least one person had died. Search and rescue teams were trying to reach others who were trapped.

Across parts of Nebraska, South Dakota and Iowa, rising water was threatening homes and covering farm fields, and the authorities warned people to stay off swamped roadways. In Minnehaha County, S.D., which includes Sioux Falls, the sheriff’s office posted a photo of a car washed off the road. In Sergeant Bluff, Iowa, near Sioux City, residents were asked to conserve their water use because “all the draining water is inundating our sewer system.” And in Nebraska, the State Patrol said at least one rural bridge appeared to have been destroyed and that large ice blocks had washed down from rivers and covered highways.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Those fights, largely over wages and working conditions, were nothing new in New York City’s long history of labor relations. But three later strikes by the teachers in the fall term of 1968 proved far more intractable, because they revolved around who would control the schools.

The strikes, which emptied classrooms for a total of eight weeks, grew out of a plan intending to improve public education by decentralizing the city’s school system. Pilot projects had been set up in three school districts, including Ocean Hill-Brownsville, in a predominantly black and Puerto Rican area of Brooklyn.

The strikes were called after the district’s board had summarily moved to transfer a group of teachers and administrators out of the district. Ten of the teachers resisted, but the board persisted even after a trial examiner for the school system did not find enough evidence to support the board’s accusations that the 10 had tried to sabotage community control or had done unsatisfactory work.

The teachers’ union saw itself in a must-win fight to protect its members’ rights and discourage such actions by other local boards. Many supporters of the district’s leadership, which was largely black, saw the strikes as an effort by a largely white and heavily Jewish union to squelch community control. Anti-Semitic and racist accusations punctuated the conflict.

Mr. Sweet, on Mr. Lindsay’s behalf, sought to persuade the union, the district’s leadership and the Board of Education to compromise. Though he won praise for his low-key manner and his ability to relieve tensions in the negotiations — Sid Davidoff, an assistant to the mayor, told The New York Times that Mr. Sweet “can deal with anybody, even an adversary, in almost a friendly way” — only the state was able to end the conflict. It suspended the district board, and the involuntary transfers were made subject to grievance procedures in the union’s contract.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>What do you know about the Electoral College? What is its purpose? How does it work? (If you need more information, you might watch the two-minute video, “The Electoral College Explained,” or read the related article, “How Does the Electoral College Work?” from 2016.)

On March 18, at a CNN town hall in Jackson, Miss., Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts called for shutting down the Electoral College. “I believe we need a constitutional amendment that protects the right to vote for every American citizen and to make sure that vote gets counted,” she said.

“The desire to abolish the Electoral College is driven by the idea Democrats want rural America to go away politically,” Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said on Twitter. His colleague Marco Rubio of Florida posted a similar note, calling the Electoral College a “work of genius” that “requires candidates for president to earn votes from various parts of country. And it makes sure interests of less populated areas aren’t ignored at the expense of densely populated areas.” President Trump weighed in as well: “With the Popular Vote, you go to just the large States — the Cities would end up running the Country. Smaller States &amp; the entire Midwest would end up losing all power — &amp; we can’t let that happen. I used to like the idea of the Popular Vote, but now realize the Electoral College is far better for the U.S.A.”

What is your reaction to Ms. Warren’s statement? Based on what you know right now, do you think the Electoral College is an important part of the United States election process? Why or why not?

Recently, two Times Opinion columnists have weighed in on the issue. In “Getting Rid of the Electoral College Isn’t Just About Trump,” Jamelle Bouie makes an argument for why the Electoral College should be abolished:

In February, I wrote about the Electoral College, its origins and its problems. Whatever its potential merits, it is a plainly undemocratic institution. It undermines the principle of “one person, one vote,” affirmed in 1964 by the Supreme Court in Reynolds v. Sims — a key part of the civil and voting rights revolution of that decade. It produces recurring political crises. And it threatens to delegitimize the entire political system by creating larger and larger splits between who wins the public and who wins the states. Many readers disagreed, making arguments similar to those used by the president and his allies. But those claims — that the Electoral College ensures rural representation, that its counter-majoritarian outcomes reflect the intentions of the framers and that it keeps large states from dominating small ones — don’t follow from the facts and are rooted more in folk civics than in how the system plays out in reality. Take rural representation. If you conceive of rural America as a set of states, the Electoral College does give voters in Iowa or Montana or Wyoming a sizable say in the selection of the president. If you conceive of it as a population of voters, on the other hand, the picture is different. Roughly 60 million Americans live in rural counties, and they aren’t all concentrated in “rural” states. Millions live in large and midsize states like California, New York, Illinois, Alabama and South Carolina. With a national popular vote for president, you could imagine a Republican campaign that links rural voters in California — where five million people live in rural counties — to those in New York, where roughly 1.4 million people live in rural counties. In other words, rural interests would be represented from coast to coast, as opposed to a system that only weights those who live in swing states. Totaling the 2016 numbers, Sam Wang, a molecular biologist at Princeton who also runs a widely read election website, found that out of almost 400 campaign stops made after the conventions, neither Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump made appearances in Arkansas, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, the Dakotas, Kansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Mississippi, New York, South Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia or Vermont. It doesn’t matter that Trump won millions of votes in New Jersey or that Hillary Clinton won millions in Texas. If your state is reliably red or blue, you are ignored. By contrast, under a national popular vote, the margin of your loss within a state matters as much as the size of your win. Democrats would have reason to maximize their share of the vote in the Deep South, and Republicans would see the same incentive in the Northeast (and the West for that matter). Still, you might argue, the Electoral College keeps large states from dominating small ones. If there were no such system, campaigns could win by focusing all their attention on the largest states. As a matter of math, that is unlikely. In 2016, New York, California, Texas and Florida cast about 35 million ballots, roughly a quarter of the total 137 million. Even if you somehow won every single one of those ballots, you’d still have to campaign elsewhere for tens of millions more votes, assuming a 50 percent threshold. Take the total of 2016 presidential votes in the 10 largest states, and you’d get only 71 million ballots, or about 52 percent of the vote. In the incredible event that a candidate won every ballot cast in those states, then yes, under a national popular vote, he or she could ignore the rest of the country and become president. But that isn’t politically possible. Even an attempt to “run up the score” and retreat to the largest cities isn’t viable — there just aren’t enough votes. Compare that with what we have under the Electoral College, where hypothetically a bare majority in the 11 largest states is all it takes to win 270 electors and become president — an actual instance of big-state domination.

And in “A Case for the Electoral College,” Ross Douthat counters:

Is there a case for a system that sometimes produces undemocratic outcomes? I think so, on two grounds. First, it creates incentives for political parties and candidates to seek supermajorities rather than just playing for 50.1 percent, because the latter play is a losing one more often than in a popular-vote presidential system. Second, it creates incentives for political parties to try to break regional blocs controlled by the opposition, rather than just maximizing turnout in their own areas, because you win the presidency consistently only as a party of multiple regions and you can crack a rival party’s narrow majority by flipping a few states. According to this — admittedly contrarian — theory, the fact that the Electoral College produces chaotic or undemocratic outcomes in moments of ideological or regional polarization is actually a helpful thing, insofar as it drives politicians and political hacks (by nature not the most creative types) to think bigger than regional blocs and 51 percent majorities. Thus the electoral/popular split of 1888 pointed the way to William McKinley and Teddy Roosevelt’s national Republican majorities, and the near-splits of 1968 and 1976 pushed us toward Reagan’s nationwide landslides and Bill Clinton’s successful center-left campaigns. Time and again a close election leads to hand-wringing about the need for Electoral College reform; time and again, politicians and parties respond to the college’s incentives, and more capacious and unifying majorities are born. Does this theory fit our current situation? In a sense, yes. Donald Trump could win the presidency without a popular-vote majority only because both parties have been locked into base-turnout strategies that are partially responsible for our government’s ineffectiveness and gridlock. And to the extent that Hillary Clinton’s campaign leaned into this polarization (writing off many constituencies that her husband competed for), she deserved her electoral-college loss. Trump could also only win the presidency without a popular-vote majority because a large region of the country, the greater Rust Belt and Appalachia, had been neglected by both parties’ policies over the preceding decades, leading to a slow-building social crisis that the national press only really noticed because of Trump’s political success. In this sense, Clinton’s weird post-election boast that her half of the country was way more economically dynamic indicated the advantages of a system where a declining region can punch above its popular-vote weight — because it makes it harder for a party associated with economic winners to simply write the losers off.

Students, read both articles, then tell us:

— Has your opinion about the Electoral College changed at all? If so, how? If not, why not?

— What does “democracy” mean to you? Given your understanding, do you believe the Electoral College is democratic? Why or why not?

— The Electoral College has elected a president who did not win the popular vote twice in the past 20 years, in 2000 and 2016. Do you think this means the system is broken? Or is it working the way it is supposed to?

— Is the Electoral College a good way of making sure every citizen’s vote counts? Why or why not?

— Do you think the United States should get rid of the Electoral College? If so, why and what should replace it? If not, why not?</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The agreement also calls for an overhaul of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the agency that oversees New York City’s bus and subway system. Mr. Cuomo, who effectively controls the authority and who has been heavily criticized for the subway’s shoddy performance, has scapegoated the agency in recent months. As part of the budget deal, the authority’s policies will be changed to encourage speedier capital projects and to increase oversight.

A wave of new progressives in the Legislature believed the issue of criminal justice reform was of critical importance, and the new budget reflected that. Under the budget legislation, the state will eliminate cash bail for most misdemeanors and nonviolent crimes, though it will not be completely eliminated, as some of the Legislature’s more liberal members — still recalling the case of Kalief Browder, who took his own life after spending three years on Rikers Island because his family could not raise $3,000 bail — had hoped it would be.

Lawmakers and Mr. Cuomo also agreed to a number of changes to discovery — allowing defendants more access to evidence that prosecutors intend to use against them — and processes to ensure speedy trials.

The compromise on bail, which came after law enforcement officials expressed concerns about the total elimination of such a system, is one of many compromises that appear in the budget.

Another saw a proposed pied-à-terre tax, an annual recurring tax on second homes that were valued at $5 million or more, eliminated. Although the tax had the backing of state leaders, it evaporated under pressure from real estate interests and legal concerns.

In its place, lawmakers and Mr. Cuomo agreed to a “mansion tax” coupled with a real estate transfer tax, two one-time levies that would be charged at the point of sale on multimillion-dollar homes. The tax rate would top out at 4.15 percent on the sale of properties worth $25 million or more.

A plan to ban plastic bags in the state was also included in the budget, but it makes a fee on paper bags optional, which some environmentalists worry will lessen the popularity of reusable bags. New York would be the second state, after California, to ban plastic bags. (Hawaii also effectively has a ban in place, since all the state’s counties bar such single-use bags.)</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“I’m glad that he’s reaching so many people on a positive level and helping them feel less alone in the world,” Ms. Embury said. “It’s bittersweet, because he’s not here.”

He was born Edison Price Vizzini — his parents named him after his grandfather, Edison Price, who founded the family’s business, Edison Price Lighting, a high-end lighting fixture manufacturing company — but he went by his nickname, Ned.

Growing up in the 1980s and ’90s in Park Slope, Brooklyn, Mr. Vizzini was a creative, precocious boy who excelled in school and loved Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

Writing came naturally to him. While he was still a student at Stuyvesant High School, he began writing for The New York Press. He wrote for The New York Times Magazine, and published his first book, an essay anthology titled “Teen Angst? Naaah,” when he was 19.

“He lived under unbelievable stress, but his truest self was really goofy, and saw the pure humor and the ludicrousness of it all,” said his sister, Nora Vizzini.

He studied computer science at Hunter College, and published his first novel when he was in his early 20s. When it came out in 2004, “Be More Chill” was celebrated as an innovative, genre-bending story that inverted classic coming-of-age and high school comedy tropes.

The novel’s teenage protagonist, Jeremy, feels invisible and irrelevant, until he swallows the tiny device that teaches him how to be cool, coaches him on how to impress girls, drive a car and deflect bullies. While on the surface it reads like a raunchy teen comedy, the novel also raises prescient questions about the corrosive side effects of technology.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“We believe that any interreligious dialogue and any fight against extremism can succeed only on the basis of a total frankness on the issue of religious freedom for Moroccan citizens, including Christian Moroccans,” said a statement by the Coordination of Moroccan Christians, a local advocacy group. “We hope that the visit of the Holy Father will be a historic opportunity to move our country forward in this direction.”

The group that meets behind curtains in Meknes wants not only to worship in broad daylight, but to do so in the places of their choosing.

“I want to name my daughter Easter and my son Joshua,” said Zouhair H., 37, a Casablanca resident and the son of an imam who stole his older brother’s Bible when he was a teenager and eventually converted. “We have our own Moroccan rites. I have no interest in praying in another language or other programs. In my own country, I don’t want to be a guest in a church” run by foreigners.

Zouhair, who has no children yet, would give only his first name for fear of harassment.

Aomar Boum, an anthropologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, said there were virtually no Moroccan Christians until a century ago — around 100 in 1933, among 106,000 or so European Catholic settlers.

Churches built all over the country during the French Protectorate, from 1912 to 1956, fell into disuse after Morocco’s independence. In recent years, these houses of worship have been revived by Christian immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa, with Moroccan converts still confined to their homes.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>DOHA, Qatar — When the United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001 and toppled the Taliban government, even those who surrendered were treated as terrorists: handcuffed, hooded and shipped to the American detention camp in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.

Now, in a stark demonstration of the twists and contradictions of the long American involvement in Afghanistan, five of those men are sitting across a negotiating table from their former captors, part of the Taliban team discussing the terms of an American troop withdrawal.

“During our time in Guantánamo, the feeling was with us that we had been brought there unjustly and that we would be freed,” said one of the former detainees, Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa. “But it never occurred to me that one day there would be negotiations with them, and I would be sitting there with them on one side and us on the other.”

The five senior Taliban officials were held at Guantánamo for 13 years before catching a lucky break in 2014. They were exchanged for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, the only known American service member to be held by the insurgents as a prisoner of war.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WASHINGTON — Scott Gottlieb, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, known for his aggressive efforts to regulate the tobacco and e-cigarette industries, said on Tuesday that he would resign at the end of the month.

The reason he gave was family and his weariness with commuting to see his wife and three children, who have remained in their Westport, Conn. home since he took office. But his announcement caught many in Washington and the industries he regulates by surprise and raised questions about whether his push to reduce teenage vaping and lower nicotine levels and ban menthol in cigarettes will continue in an administration that generally has a hands-off approach to business.

“It’s critical that his successor champions protecting kids and the rest of the nation against the tobacco epidemic,” said Cliff Douglas, vice president of tobacco control at the American Cancer Society. “Gottlieb has taken historic steps to take on this epidemic in a new way, including such proposals as reducing nicotine in cigarettes to nonaddictive levels and now pursuing a potential ban on menthol in cigarettes, so it is critical that whoever succeeds him picks up that mantel and treats it with equal priority that he has given it.”

Dr. Gottlieb has been subject to increasing pressure from some Republicans in Congress and his former associates in the conservative movement for his tough stance against youth vaping and traditional cigarettes. A coalition of influential conservative groups recently asked the White House to block some key parts of the F.D.A.’s strategy to prevent youths from vaping. Republican Senator Richard Burr blasted the commissioner on the Senate floor for his proposal to ban menthol cigarettes.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>When Paine Field, about 25 miles north of Seattle in Everett, Wash., was born in the 1930s as a New Deal project, it was envisioned as a major commercial airport for the region. But that never happened. Instead, it became known as the place where Boeing offers “North America’s only publicly available commercial jet assembly plant tour.”

That is about to change. Thanks to private investment, Paine Field is finally set to offer air service to the public. A sleek, new, $40 million two-gate terminal was built by Propeller Airports, a Seattle company, and commercial flights are set to begin this month.

Brett Smith, Propeller’s founder and chief executive, expects that travelers will be attracted by the convenience of avoiding traffic jams near Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. “No reason why tax dollars should be used to build passenger travel while there’s private-sector money ready and willing to do it,” he said.

As governments reduce spending on infrastructure, private companies are moving into airports big and small, paying for private terminals with new types of services and teaming up with local agencies to renovate existing terminals. The so-called public-private partnerships, or P3s, have created new possibilities for airports, which have struggled for years to find the money to improve terminals and accommodate an increase in passengers and cargo. An Airport Council International report released in 2017 estimated that airports would need almost $100 billion for capital projects over the next five years, but would only be able to finance about half that amount.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Good Tuesday morning. Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today.
• Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, who has played down talk of impeachment for months, ratcheted up her objections to trying to remove President Trump from office, saying that “he’s just not worth it.” She believes Democrats are better off trying to beat Mr. Trump at the polls in 2020.
• Mr. Trump sent Congress a record $4.75 trillion budget request that calls for increased military spending and sharp cuts to domestic programs like education and environmental protection for the 2020 fiscal year. The blueprint is a declaration of Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign priorities and the starting skirmish in the 2020 race.
• The president’s budget proposal brims with confidence that the United States economy will continue to grow at a rapid pace, despite recent data suggesting economic growth is slowing.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>If you want to build a successful career, you have a dilemma on where to start. Should you pick the most prestigious organization, where you’ll be a small fish in a big pond? Or should you take the most influential position, where you’ll be a big fish in a small pond?

Kat Cole has an answer, and it’s not what you’d expect. At just 32, Ms. Cole became the president of a billion-dollar brand: Cinnabon. Her meteoric rise didn’t begin from a blue-chip company or a high-impact role. Her pivotal decision was to start her career as a waitress … at Hooters.

Although people are often drawn to the workplaces with the highest status, it’s not always best to be in the biggest pond. In a 2017 study of professional soccer teams, researchers examined what happened to players on teams that were just above and below the cutoff to get relegated to a lower division.

Being dropped to a lower division sent teams down to a smaller pond with weaker competition. Yet over their careers, younger players whose teams were downgraded landed in stronger leagues and earned higher wages. Why? They got more playing time because the stakes were lower and they faced less competition for key positions — and they grew more as a result.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Before Judge Ellis, Mr. Manafort’s lawyers repeatedly suggested that the special counsel’s office pursued their client because of his importance to the Russia inquiry. They said his political consulting work for four American presidents, including Mr. Trump, spoke to his high ideals. And they argued that the special counsel’s office had vilified him for what are essentially garden-variety crimes that for other defendants merited only limited time behind bars.

“Most importantly, what you saw today is the same thing that we have said from Day 1,” Mr. Downing, one of Mr. Manafort’s lawyers, said in a short statement outside the courthouse. “There is absolutely no evidence that Paul Manafort was involved in any collusion with any government official or Russia.”

While Judge Ellis faulted Mr. Manafort for not apologizing for his criminal conduct, he also noted that the special counsel’s office had not requested a specific prison term.

During the trial, prosecutors put forward exhaustive evidence of how Mr. Manafort had illegally concealed his work on behalf of political parties in Ukraine that were aligned with Russia and of how he hid more than $55 million in payments from that work in more than 30 overseas bank accounts.

Once his income from Ukraine dried up, the evidence showed, Mr. Manafort deceived banks to obtain loans to sustain a lavish lifestyle. At the same time, he worked for the Trump campaign at no cost, apparently hoping his status as campaign chairman would attract deep-pocketed foreign clients. He was fired from the campaign after five months when the scandal over his hidden income from Ukraine broke in August 2016.

“The defendant blames everyone from the special counsel’s office to his Ukrainian clients for his own criminal choices,” prosecutors wrote in a sentencing memo.

Mr. Manafort was indicted on 18 counts in the Northern Virginia case, but the jury convicted him on only eight: five counts of tax fraud, two counts of bank fraud and one count of failure to disclose a foreign bank account. Because of one holdout juror, the panel deadlocked on the other charges. Mr. Manafort admitted that he was guilty of those as well, though, as part of his plea agreement.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Venezuela’s aid predicament has mirrored the international alliances forged by the competing sides. The United States and the European Union nations have become the main donors for humanitarian projects launched by Mr. Guaidó. China and Russia have delivered relief supplies to Mr. Maduro.

Mr. Guaidó has opened three aid depots on Venezuela’s borders in Colombia, Brazil and Curacao, which have collected at least $100 million worth of supplies donated by the United States Agency for International Development and other allies. Mr. Maduro called the USAID supplies a “Trojan horse” aimed at toppling his government and has vowed to prevent it from entering the country. His vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, even called the opposition’s supplies “cancerous.”

Mr. Guaidó’s plan to bring basic supplies into Venezuela in February, intended to help the population but also to bolster his standing and discredit Mr. Maduro, was stymied by Mr. Maduro’s armed forces and paramilitaries. At least seven people were killed and dozens were seriously injured during the chaotic and inconclusive standoff along the country’s border.

The Red Cross said its relief in Venezuela will not be linked to any political parties.

To maintain impartiality, the Red Cross said supplies such as surgical kits and basic medication will initially be delivered directly to the eight hospitals that the organization owns in Venezuela, bypassing the government’s distribution networks. The organization also aims to equip all Venezuelan hospitals with power generators to reduce the number of deaths caused by the rolling blackouts affecting the country.

Mr. Rocca said the organizations would also consider distributing medical donations collected by the opposition in Cúcuta, Colombia, if they met their standards.

The Red Cross was granted the permission after personal meetings with Mr. Maduro and Mr. Guaidó, said a person involved in negotiations, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss confidential talks.

The announcement comes days after the United Nations made a confidential plea to the country’s two rival leaders to end their political dispute over aid, pointing out that nearly all of the country’s population of 32 million has been thrust into poverty.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>YOKOHAMA, Japan — A committee formed to address failings of Nissan’s corporate governance recommended an overhaul of the Japanese automaker’s board on Wednesday as it seeks to move past the arrest of its former chairman Carlos Ghosn.

The recommendations laid the blame for the company’s failings squarely at the feet of Mr. Ghosn and his close associate, Greg Kelly.

Japanese prosecutors detained both men in November on suspicion that they had conspired to underreport Mr. Ghosn’s compensation. In the months since, Mr. Ghosn has been arrested and rearrested on charges of financial wrongdoing from 2010 to 2018 while leading Nissan. He was released this month after paying bail of 1 billion yen (roughly $9 million) and agreeing to strict conditions on his activities, including limits on his contacts with people involved in the case.

The news media in Japan and abroad have published allegations of financial excesses while Mr. Ghosn led the automaking alliance of Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi, including luxury homes in three cities, expensive personal trips, lavish parties at Versailles and most recently college tuition at Stanford for his four children. The details raise questions about how he and the companies he ran managed their affairs.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Arizona prosecutors said Tuesday that they had not found evidence to charge Uber with a crime in connection with an accident in which one of its autonomous cars hit and killed a pedestrian in Tempe a year ago.

On March 18, 2018, a Volvo sport utility vehicle, one of several self-driving vehicles that Uber was testing, was traveling about 40 miles per hour when it hit Elaine Herzberg, 49, as she was walking her bicycle across the street at night, the authorities said.

While the car was in autonomous mode, a safety driver was sitting in the driver’s seat.

The Yavapai County Attorney’s Office, which reviewed the case, said in a letter dated Monday that there was “no basis for criminal liability for the Uber corporation.”

But it added that investigators should look into what the safety driver “would or should have seen that night given the vehicle’s speed, lighting conditions, and other relevant factors.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The authorities in Charlottesville, Va., arrested a 17-year-old boy on Friday in connection with an online threat targeting black and Hispanic students, bringing a sense of relief to a saga that had forced the closing of the city’s public schools for two straight days.

The teenager, who was not identified, is believed to have published a post on the web forum 4chan that threatened an “ethnic cleansing” at Charlottesville High School, the authorities said.

The post set off a rapid investigation and prompted the Charlottesville public school district, which serves about 4,300 students from kindergarten to high school, to shut down all of its campuses on Thursday and Friday.

By midday Friday, the Charlottesville Police Department had announced that a suspect was in custody and had been charged with threatening to commit serious bodily harm on a school property, as well as harassment.</TEXT>

Every winter, many of the men in my office grow beards. One of my direct reports has been doing so for the seven years we’ve been working together. This year, however, it’s longer than before, and he cannot keep his hands off it. He is constantly stroking, twisting, scratching and arranging it. Inevitably he’ll break off a hair or two between his fingers, rubbing it between thumb and forefinger, examining it and trying to figure out where to put it (ew, gross!!!).

But the move that literally has me gagging is when he picks up the left edge of his ’stache and puts it in his mouth. I can barely type these words. It has gotten to the point that I cannot even look at him in meetings. This is particularly awkward when we meet in my office for our regular check-ins.

I am his supervisor. I am female. He is a nice but sensitive guy who has had some anxiety issues. I get the sense that this beard is a security blanket. What can I say to him to get him to stop before I vomit in front of him when that thing goes in his mouth one. more. time?</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Sometimes, when life throws you a curve, it can be a golden opportunity. Jasmit Singh Rangr was happily settled in Manhattan, running Rangr Studio, the design practice he founded in 2004, when in 2014, his wife, Abigail Dillen, was offered a vice president’s job at her longtime employer, Earthjustice, that required moving to San Francisco.

“I loved being in New York,” Mr. Rangr said. But at least the move would allow the couple and their now-6-year-old son, Sher, to leave what he described as their “dismal little Upper West Side rental.”

Ms. Dillen — who is now the president of Earthjustice, a nonprofit that uses the court system to protect the environment — suggested looking in the Berkeley Hills. After going through the now-common experience of finding a house, only to be outbid by someone with lots of ready cash, the couple discovered a bank that would lend them the money to buy an empty lot (preferably one with a view, which would maximize resale value). Through a combination of dogged research and luck, they found property that they could buy for its appraised value rather than the market price. And on this steeply sloping site, Mr. Rangr designed a spare, light-filled house that measures 2,850 square feet, but takes maximum advantage of a view that includes the Bay Bridge, the Golden Gate Bridge and Mount Tamalpais in Marin County. He and his family moved in, in late 2016.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>TORONTO — Miriam Toews woke up the other night, her heart racing. She wasn’t having another dream about her sister’s violent death, or her father’s, or the rapes suffered by the women at the center of her latest book, “Women Talking,” to be released April 2 in the United States. This night, her Mennonite conscience had found something far more mundane to worry over: Toews had promised the department store saleswoman who so kindly helped her pick out the right pants for her 83-year-old mother, Elvira, that she would send a complimentary email to her boss, and she’d forgotten.

So, the celebrated writer — who in Canada is more famous than many hockey players — crept out of bed, made her way down to the living room and turned on her computer.

“I wondered about myself at that point,” said Toews (pronounced taves), sitting in the small, brick Victorian house she shares with Elvira and her common-law spouse, Erik Rutherford, in a dense, downtown Toronto neighborhood. It’s a world away from the small Mennonite town of her childhood, Steinbach, Manitoba.

“Now I’m here and what do I do? Think about Steinbach all the time,” said Toews, 54. “I must be nearing death.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>============================================= LUKE: “An Englishman, an Irishman and a Scottishman walk into a bar. The Englishman wants to leave, so everyone has to leave” TOUTS: music “This paranoia ,...” TITLE: DISPATCH FROM NORTHERN IRELAND TOUTS: Singing KASSIE: How was Northern Ireland considered when this was - MATTHEW CROSSAN / LUKE MCLAUGHLIN - I don’t think it was considered at all. JASON FEENAN: Brexit is the exit of the United Kingdom based on the wishes of Great Britain. MATTHEW: (When Article 50 was actually triggered) The exact words that Theresa May used was that because of the wishes- THERESA MAY file: Under accordance with the wishes of the British people, the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union MATTHEW: Great Britain consists of Scotland, England and Wales. And the United Kingdom consists of Scotland, England and Wales and Northern Ireland. (MAP) So even in her language it shows that definitely when it first happened there wasn’t much thought. MATTHEW: I am struggling to see any positives for the North of Ireland. But that didn’t last long. The question of Northern Ireland and its border has frustrated negotiations over Brexit. We came here to find out why. And to understand the consequences for people who live here. For the last century, Northern Ireland has had to wrestle with its identity- torn between Protestants who consider themselves British Unionists and Catholics who mostly identify as Irish Nationalists. The divide has brought years of conflict. In 1968 the Catholic minority rose up against Unionist and British control, spurring 30 years of brutal sectarian violence known here as The Troubles. In 1998 both sides came together under the Good Friday Agreement, It created a somewhat unique reality here. Northern Ireland would continue to be a part of the UK, but also, open its border completely with the rest of Ireland. But the history of The Troubles is inescapable. Murals are everywhere. And Neighborhoods are color coded along sectarian lines. Here in Londonderry, or Derry, depending on whom you ask, there are walls that separate Protestants from Catholics. And the gates are locked every night. For punk band Touts, this us and them mentality, has informed more than just their music. LUKE: I’ve lived here 22 years - me whole life, basically and there’s places in Derry I’ve never been, or I’ve never walked to. I think that’s crazy. MIRIAM WHYTE: Well it’s kind of rough,cause there’s the Bogside - the mostly Catholic area then there’s here, which is clearly the more Protestant area, but very divided, even though there’s trying to do more what is it called when they like - integration or something. People told us those divisions have deepened since the Brexit vote. Under Brexit, Northern Ireland would leave with the UK, and the Republic of Ireland would remain in the EU. An idea that appears to overlook the reality on the ground here. We headed east, thinking we could drive along the border - but it wasn’t so simple. In part because the border is mostly invisible. To get from one town in Northern Ireland to another, we crossed into the Republic of Ireland multiple times - without even realizing it. The roads continuously zigzag across international lines. Nat sound Kassie: Oh! We just crossed. Speaker: Ah good morning everyone, my name is Florence and welcome to our cross-border conference, Brexit and Young People, Can You Hear Us? These high school students live in border communities. Many commute seamlessly from one side to the other to attend school. SPEAKER: The project recruits young people from both Protestant and Catholic communities on both sides of border. LARRY: Now does anyone have some strong views on that like how would you see yourselves different than someone in the north? GIRL: If you have an Irish passport, in my mind you’re Irish, doesn’t matter where you’re parents are from, doesn’t matter what background you have, if you carry an Irish passport, you’re Irish. It’s part of the Good Friday agreement: residents of Northern Ireland can choose a British or Irish passport. Or both. DOIRE FINN: People living in Northern Ireland are allowed to have a British passport and an Irish passport and I think I identify as Irish but I mean I hold a British passport so really, for my identity isn’t ever something that in my family was a massive issue. My parents kind of said, “You identify as how you feel” and I think that that was a really nice way to bring us up. DOIRE: The census that was happening here you could either say you were Irish or British my mum wanted to identify as European and they were like, “Well, you’re not allowed” and she was like, “No, I’m identifying myself as European.” And they were like “You have to pick.” By aiming to separate the UK from the EU, Brexit could interrupt the free flow of people and goods - and violate the Good Friday Agreement. ALAN (walking with Kassie) - I hope, I hope when you’ve got photographs my cows now, that we finish up getting a better price for these cows. Alan Mc Farland raises cattle and sheep a few miles north of the border. But he gets his feed from a distributor in the South. It’s a transaction that happens regularly, without border checks, customs duties or tariffs. ALAN McFARLAND: No one knows what the final result is yet going to be - we just approach our business each and every day having made an assumption that post-Brexit we will be trading with the same people on the same terms. KASSIE: Did you feel strongly about staying or leaving? ALAN: I was actually undecided in the matter, to the extent that I didn’t vote at all. But having that said in Northern Ireland the majority of the vote was remaining in the E.U. **GRAPHIC of vote breakdown** ALAN: But one thing I would say you always have the right to change is to change your mind - I would be in favor of a second referendum, to do away with the ambiguity. That’s because many people here remember the border as a source of hostility and violence. And a whole generation since then has grown up without one. HARD BORDER MONTAGE FARMER: NO HARD BORDER GIRL: HARD BORDER LEAD TO TROUBLE SOMEONE ELSE: IT JUST MAKES THINGS HARDER But when Prime Minister Theresa May tried to introduce a provision.. MONTAGE: BACKSTOP BACKSTOP ..that would guarantee an exit without a hard border in Northern Ireland, hardline Brexiters rejected it...arguing an open border would essentially keep the UK tethered to the EU. So no hard border, no deal, and so far no Brexit. ... Also, no sense of where all this could lead. ALAN: I think there should be a second referendum FR. McVEIGH (287_2358.MFX 09:08): I want to see Ireland reunified. Because I think it’s the only hope for this island. Economically, culturally. ANGLICAN: We need to stay with England for their money And while everyone saidsays they didn’tdon’t want a return to violence, the uncertainty seems to be threatening what is already a fragile peace. //testing the country’s fragile peace.

ANGLICAN: We were in the sun and now Brexit destroyed the sun SIOBHAN: If there is a hard Brexit I think there will be damaged but we will have to be OK at the end of it. And we’ve been through harder times than this before. FIRST NAME, LAST NAME Siobhan is a mental health expert who studieds? the effects of the country’s history on mental health. SIOBHAN: Well, we’ve got to adopt a trauma-informed approach and think about everything from the perspective of those who’ve been a victim of violence. We have no way of describing it. We have no common narrative. And it’s going to take a while for us to generate those materials. TOUTS: This paranoia, when will it end, I’ve heard it all before and I’m hearing it again. DAOIRE: I think I’m just really scared about the future of Northern Ireland. I love living here and I think it’s a lovely place to be. The craic’s really good and everyone’s really friendly and I don’t want that to be dragged backwards into a past that was really, really dark for so many people. And I think, you know, there’s so many good things about Northern Ireland and I just don’t want those to go away.

There’s some evidence that biological changes that happen in response to trauma, that that’s passed to the next generation and in effect it’s programming the next generation to be able to respond more quickly and rapidly if there’s a bombing or a shooting or whatever. But of course when a child has that it increases the risk of mental illness. Um, there’ve been more deaths by suicide since the signing of the Good Friday agreement than there were through the whole of the troubles through violence.

In Derry, The Touts’ singer and drummer weren’t old enough to vote in the referendum, but they live in the country many expect to be most impacted by the deal. We drove The singer and drummer weren’t old enough to vote in the referendum, but they live in the country many expect to be most impacted by the deal. Theirs is the generation that grew up after the good Friday agreement that ended decades of sectarian violence has only known relative peace in the region. ASSEMBLY 031019 - KASSIE NOTES Notes - I think we need in the narration a sense that, despite the fact this generation is defined by growing up in peace, there are still deep divides and conflict. Brexit has already impacted this by exacerbating polarization and creating economic uncertainty and anxiety that violence could return. I would love to try to use the Touts/kids in park/Derry to establish the “us” v “them” nature of Northern Ireland - I agree the piece is not about sectarianism per se, but it sets up and personalizes the visual sense of place - the “dispatchy-ness” - peace walls and murals, and also then might have more impact when we see that it seems most young people are united in the feeling like they weren’t considered. Also, Brexit was prompted in large part by the us v them mentality in England, but in NI, as compared to the rest of UK, they already have their own us v them which continues today. **** It’s here in Derry where many say “The Troubles” began, in 1968, - when the predominantly Catholic community protested against housing and employment discrimination. A civil rights march was brutally shut down by police/army. It led to roughly 30 years of sectarian violence between the predominantly Catholic Nationalists who consider themselves Irish, and the Unionists, who consider themselves British, the majority, Protestant. BEAT TWO: THE BREXIT Generation in Northern Ireland - Youth/Derry/Recent History - fear of retriggering violence felt most acutely by people nearest the border BEAT THREE: YOUNG PEOPLE’S CONFERENCE Challenging Identity, Good Friday - which allowed people to claim Irish or British citizenships - the idea that the fluidity of movement will be stopped BEAT FOUR: along the actual border between the countries, it is much more complicated - interwoven - FARMER BEAT FIVE: The members of Touts call Derry their home. Many say it’s here where the period known as the “The Troubles” began, in 1968, - when the predominantly Catholic community protested against housing and employment discrimination and unfair voting policies under British rule. But some claimed it to be a cover for paramilitary actors, and a peaceful civil rights march was halted by police in a brutal crackdown. 30 years of deadly sectarian violence followed between the predominantly Catholic Nationalists who consider themselves Irish, and the Unionists, who identify as British - the majority, Protestant. Sound up on Touts Touts may have grown up in the comparatively peaceful era marked by the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. But their city, called Derry by nationalists and Londonderry by unionists remains fractured. The tensions never way and in fact many say Brexit has exacerbated it TOUTS: Line about divisions still there Schools are still mostly segregated along sectarian lines. As are neighborhoods. A TKTK fence/wall helps secure the border between a Catholic community and a Protestant community. Every night, it is locked for protection. TOUTS Line about impact of Brexit already? Or line about Brexit? Just 100 feet away from the wall, in the mostly Protestant community The Fountain, we spoke with a group of teenagers about TKTK MIRIAM: Nearly everyone I spoke with mentioned/agreed the same worst case scenario HARD BORDER MONTAGE To impose a hard border, with check points and official crossings would cause headaches both practically and symbolically.

Brexit, and Northern Ireland itself. 45 second history lesson of Northern Ireland And this is the legacy they’ve inherited. NOW made worse by… Brexit! Borders are usually about keeping people in or keeping people out, In this case, But it’s about something more nuanced and complicated, like the border itself DRONE SHOT OF MEANDERING BORDER And Ireland, with its taste for storytelling and humor has a singular relationship with its own border People wandering in and out, funny smuggling stories. LOYALISTS EQUANIMOUS STATEMENT ABOUT BREXIT (maybe from mental health professor) CONCLUSION: AT THE BAR IN DERRY WITH THE TOUTS (with compelling TOUT SOT) One of the other key stipulations of the Good Friday agreement was a free border with the south. Now, Brexit is threatening this. It’s the thing people I spoke with said worried them most. HARD BORDER Montage. Before I got here I’d planned to drive along the border - it wasn’t so simple. Here’s the border. On my TKTK mile journey from TK to TK, I crossed international lines/crossed TKTK times. THIS SECTION TBA BASED ON GRAPHIC I often didn’t even realize I’d crossed. Thirty years ago, this crossing would have looked more like this: FR. McVEIGH (287_2356.MXF 03:23)): The hardline Brexit people are determined to leave without a deal if necessary, or with a deal without a backstop - (that’s the only thing that’s going to satisfy them, and the DUP who are propping up the London government) 04:50 The Brexiteers in London don’t care all that much. Father Joe McVeigh grew up along the border and remembers the checkpoints as violent hotspots. Sound up: Fr. McVeigh shows Kassie photos of the border But this bridge at the border in Belleek shows none of the vestiges of That’s help spur a new momentum for a united Ireland. 13:35 If the Brexit people want to continue their line, they have to consider what’s going to happen to us. We needed to be treated separately and differently. The fear of a hard border, with all of the economic and practical implications has given rise to another potential outcome. FR. McVEIGH (287_2358.MFX 09:08): I want to see Ireland reunified. Because I think it’s the only hope for this island. Economically, culturally. (08:54 It has to happen, it just has to happen 09:45 Partition has run out of road. ) FARMER: Voted to remain in the EU. So leaving the EU would go against the voting majority of Northern Ireland. But leaving the UK altogether would go against the wishes of some of Northern Ireland’s Protestant majority. ANGLICAN: Protestant people would certainly be nervous of any changes. There’s a huge amount of money that comes from Westminster and London. Ironically, the hardline Brexit position has revived some calls for a United Ireland FR. McVEIGH : I want to see Ireland reunified. Because I think it’s the only hope for this island. But positions like Friar McVeigh’s aren’t very popular, especially among Protestants in Northern Ireland’s 6 counties, who would become a minority overnight if they joined Ireland’s 26 as one country. So maybe they could have a political border that remains somewhat relaxed. That’s called a Soft Border or an Irish Backstop. Theresa May: Irish Backstop montage But no one really knows how that would work or what it would look like, which is why it’s been such a bee in the bonnet of the Brexit process. Some hardline Brexiters are calling for the re-establishment of a hard border, a fringe position that proved very unpopular with most of the people I met while I was here: HARD BORDER MONTAGE The hard border was both inconvenient and psychologically fraught. TO SIOBHAN Leaving the United Kingdom altogether would mean losing money from England. The DUP advocates it effectively mean keeping the And that’s why the Irish backstop came up and failed?. THERESA MAY: BACKSTOP MONTAGE. When May tried to introduce a deal that said no hard border, hard brexiteers, including forcing Britain to play by the rules of a single European market even after it separates from the EU, it wouldn’t pass. It was meant to guarantee that there would be no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after the UK separates from the EU. But then, how and where would goods undergo checks as they travel between the UK and the EU. There’s no easy answer? The backstop provision says Britain should continue to play by the rules of a single European market until politicians can agree on how and where goods will undergo checks as they travel between the UK and the EU. But how can the UK leave without violating the terms of the peace treaty that calls for an open border here? Which is, in part, why politicians do not agree on the terms of the backstop, and it’s unclear if they ever will. They didn’t want to feel tethered to the EU. It leaves the question of Brexit unsolved and opens up new questions for Northern Ireland. It all leads to this renewed interest among some people for a united ireland. Of leaving the UK altogether. Siobhan O’Neill is a leading mental health researcher who has studied the legacy of the Troubles, And the border debate has, somewhat ironically, revived an old argument (for reuniting the north with the south) Is FR. McVEIGH (287_2358.MFX 09:08): I want to see Ireland reunified. Because I think it’s the only hope for this island. Economically, culturally. The present is more closely tied to the past here than There’s been a fragile peace here for 20 years but Brexit Well, we’ve got to adopt a trauma-informed approach and think about everything from the perspective of those who’ve been a victim of violence. We have no way of describing it. We have no common narrative. And it’s going to take a while for us to generate those materials. But despite 20 years of fragile peace And Brexit has also had a real psychological impact on the citizens of Northern Ireland For a country that is only a generation away from one of the most bitter conflicts in modern history the tumult How will Northern Ireland SIOBHAN: LINE ABOUT HOW BREXIT HAS ALREADY HAD AN IMPACT</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Lawyers for Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, and 14 other men charged with soliciting prostitution in Jupiter, Fla., have filed a motion in Palm Beach County, Fla., to keep private all evidence in the case, which includes hidden camera video of the men inside a massage parlor over several days in late January.

In the filing, the lawyers said the evidence had not been produced in discovery, and therefore should remain confidential. The lawyers added that their clients “dispute the position of the prosecutors that there may be a ‘victim’ of any offense at issue in these cases,” a suggestion that they do not believe sex trafficking was taking place at the massage parlor, as prosecutors have alleged.

In asking the court to seal the evidence, the lawyers may be trying to prevent the evidence from leaking and becoming public, which could be embarrassing.

Mr. Kraft, by far the most well-known defendant in the group, pleaded not guilty to two first-degree misdemeanor solicitation charges at the end of February. The prosecutors said Mr. Kraft, who is accused as a first-time offender, was unlikely to face jail time in this case.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>LONDON — Britain’s Parliament grabbed control Monday of the government’s efforts to leave the European Union, challenging the country’s political traditions and inflicting on Prime Minister Theresa May a rebuke not suffered by any recent predecessor.

By stepping into the process known as Brexit and trying to define an alternative path, lawmakers could create a constitutional showdown in Britain, where the government normally controls the agenda in Parliament, especially on its most pressing issues.

Parliament passed an amendment giving itself the power to vote on alternatives to the government’s Brexit plan. Its attempt to take control of the process came as Mrs. May prepared for a last-ditch effort to persuade lawmakers to support her withdrawal plan, which has already been rejected twice by huge margins.

On Monday she admitted that there was “not sufficient support” to make another quick attempt to push it through, though she might try again on Thursday.</TEXT>

Waving South Korean flags and chanting “Manse!” (which roughly translates to “Long live Korean independence!”), the crowd celebrated the students and other protesters who fought to shake Korea of Japanese colonial rule a century ago.

In honor of those student demonstrators, particularly Yu Gwan-sun, who became the face of the fight for freedom, dozens of women donned replicas of the white-and-black uniforms once worn by Yu and her peers at the Ewha Haktang school for women in Seoul.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“If a male entertainer who chose to dye his hair and sport tattoos, earrings, a long ponytail … appears on a variety show, what will be left on the screen?” asked an entertainment blog named No. 3 Theater Inspector. Two years ago, the blog noted, that entertainer would have been considered normal.

The entertainment industry has no choice but to go along. Last year, regulators shut down over 6,000 websites and over two million online accounts and social media groups. When one short video app, Miaopai, was shut down and then reinstated, the founder promised to shake up the app by adhering to core socialist values and creating positive content, according to an internal letter that was published in Chinese media.

The stark loss of edge of China’s first hip-hop show, “The Rap of China,” offers another cautionary tale. It was by no means critical of society or current affairs. Still, rappers dissed one another and argued with the judges in its first season in 2017, giving Chinese viewers a glimpse of the swagger and rebelliousness of hip-hop.

Then came the crackdown. A co-champion of the show, Wang Hao, who raps under the name PG One, apologized last year after accusations from the state media and the Communist Party Youth League that lyrics in one of his older tracks encouraged drug use. When entertainment blogs accused him of having a relationship with a married actress, streaming services pulled his music.

When the second season of “The Rap of China” aired, the tone of the show changed. The contestants rapped about love, dreams and family. IQiyi, the video platform that produced the show, changed the name to “China’s New Rap,” explaining that the new name nodded to a new era for China.

To Lippi Zhao, an engineer and a fan of hip-hop music in the city of Xi’an, the second season was both lame and ironic. Both finalists that season were Uighurs, a predominantly Muslim ethnic group living in the Chinese region of Xinjiang. The authorities there have forced as many as one million Muslims, most of them Uighurs, into detention camps. “The Rap of China” didn’t touch the subject.

“They had to know what their own people were going through,” Mr. Zhao said. “But they had to do everything to avoid the elephant in the room while competing in the show.”</TEXT>

“Thank you for everyone accepting who I am and the dedication I have put into my work to be the best player I could be,” he said. “But now its time to move forward and move forward with a big smile knowing that the New England Patriots Organization, Pats Nation, and all my fans will be truly a big part of my heart for rest of my life.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Ms. Begum has asked to return for the sake of her newborn son, and British law prevents the government from stripping someone’s citizenship if doing so would render the person stateless. But British news outlets have reported that the Home Office decided it could revoke Ms. Begum’s citizenship because her mother has a passport from Bangladesh, which would typically qualify the daughter for citizenship there.

The Home Office said last month that while it could not comment on individual cases, Mr. Javid has the power to deprive a British national of his or her citizenship “in order to protect this country,” so long as doing so does not render the person stateless.

Mr. Taylor, the New Zealander — who is known by his Twitter alias, “Kiwi Jihadi” — traveled to Syria in 2014. He told the ABC that he had worked as a guard on the border between territory controlled by the Islamic State and the Syrian government.

“There’s a difference between fighting and guarding,” he said. “Guarding, you don’t need to plan anything; attacking, you need to make preparations.”

Mr. Taylor appeared in an Islamic State promotional video that called for attacks on celebrations in Australia and New Zealand for Anzac Day, a holiday that commemorates those countries’ citizens who died in overseas wars. He told the ABC that he had witnessed several beheadings and executions during his time with the group.

He also said he that expected New Zealand to eventually take him back, but that he would probably need to spend “a couple of years” in prison.

“I’m sorry for causing too much trouble and being a bit hotheaded and flamboyant in my approach,” said Mr. Taylor, who also goes by the names Muhammad Daniel and Abu Abdul-Rahman.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>On the other side of the debate are school reformers who contend that tough accountability systems like Staar are a civil rights imperative, and that they protect low-income students and students of color from what President George W. Bush famously called “the soft bigotry of low expectations.”

The 2018 Staar tests found that 58 percent of Texas third graders are not reading at grade level. On the 2017 National Assessment of Educational Progress, given to a sample of fourth graders across the country, 72 percent of Texas students were not proficient in reading — a fact the state has cited as evidence that tough local standards are warranted.

More than half of the state’s public school students are Hispanic and nearly 60 percent come from low-income families. About a fifth are still learning English.

Texas is, in many ways, the birthplace of the American education reform movement. It was among the first to use student test scores to rate schools. But the state has also been accused, repeatedly, of lowering standards to inflate performance, and has made a concerted effort in recent years to raise them. Now it is being accused of overcorrecting.

“Every parent wants their kid to do better,” said Jeff Cottrill, deputy commissioner of the Texas Education Agency. “When you hear maybe it’s the test’s fault, it makes you feel a little bit better.”

But Mr. Cottrill defended the Staar exams, and warned against a false sense of complacency. Any attack on standardized testing, he said, “has the ability to destabilize high expectations for students.”

Kristen took the Staar last spring, when she was in third grade. Her parents, who live in this working-class suburb east of Dallas, were later told in a report that their daughter was “approaching” grade level in reading, like a third of Texas third graders who took the test — some 128,000 students.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>COLUMBIA, S.C. — Jack White arrived at Duke in the summer of 2016, a hard-working, eager kid from Traralgon, Australia, thinking he was ready for big-time college basketball. He had no idea exactly what he was about to face.

In a summer pickup game, White found himself guarding another incoming freshman, Jayson Tatum, a recruit from St. Louis who wound up as the No. 3 pick in the N.B.A. draft less than a year later. Tatum took White into the low post, but White fought for his defensive position and cut off Tatum’s access to the rim.

So Tatum jumped away from the basket, spun in midair and swished a turnaround jumper over White’s outstretched arm.

“You would never see that shot taken in Australia,” White said.

In his three seasons at Duke, White has seen quite a few things he never would have in Australia. Forget guarding some of the top players in the Atlantic Coast Conference — in his first two years, White went chest to chest with no fewer than four N.B.A. lottery picks in Duke practices alone. This season, Zion Williamson, R.J. Barrett and Cam Reddish joined that group; those three are expected to be selected high in the first round of this summer’s N.B.A. draft, making it seven lottery picks who have put White through his paces — and the ringer — at one point or another.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Teams have tried less inventive strategies to bypass Fall’s 8-foot-4 wingspan. Fall, who is bulkier than Bol or Bradley, said that he had heard opposing coaches tell players to go after his knees.

Though he is all but assured of breaking the Division I record for career field-goal percentage — he currently shoots over 74 percent; the record is 67.8 — Fall converts only 36 percent of his free throws. Fall — whose hands are 10½ inches long — said that when he shoots free throws it feels as if he is holding a volleyball.

His shooting form, which involves using only his right hand while flinging his left arm in the air and then slouching, has drawn derisive comments on social media, where he is sometimes treated as a sideshow. After Fall had 13 points and 10 rebounds in a win over Houston that ended the Cougars' 33-game home winning streak, Fall got more attention for a GIF that showed him holding the ball over an opponent’s head like an older brother playing keep-away.

Fall and Koumadje are accustomed to stares in airports and snide remarks from opposing fans. While both harbor N.B.A. dreams — neither appears in most mock drafts — they also envision a life beyond basketball, when their height won’t dictate how others perceive them.

Koumadje said he would eventually like to work for the United Nations, helping refugees in Chad. Fall wants to become an engineer.

“Basketball’s opened a lot of doors for me, but there’s more to me than the ball, the hoop,” Fall said. “I definitely don’t want to be defined by that. I definitely don’t want to be seen as an attraction, either.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>At the same time, there are real safety concerns to address before we can implement end-to-end encryption across all of our messaging services. Encryption is a powerful tool for privacy, but that includes the privacy of people doing bad things. When billions of people use a service to connect, some of them are going to misuse it for truly terrible things like child exploitation, terrorism, and extortion. We have a responsibility to work with law enforcement and to help prevent these wherever we can. We are working to improve our ability to identify and stop bad actors across our apps by detecting patterns of activity or through other means, even when we can’t see the content of the messages, and we will continue to invest in this work. But we face an inherent tradeoff because we will never find all of the potential harm we do today when our security systems can see the messages themselves.

Finding the right ways to protect both privacy and safety is something societies have historically grappled with. There are still many open questions here and we’ll consult with safety experts, law enforcement and governments on the best ways to implement safety measures. We’ll also need to work together with other platforms to make sure that as an industry we get this right. The more we can create a common approach, the better.

On balance, I believe working towards implementing end-to-end encryption for all private communications is the right thing to do. Messages and calls are some of the most sensitive private conversations people have, and in a world of increasing cyber security threats and heavy-handed government intervention in many countries, people want us to take the extra step to secure their most private data. That seems right to me, as long as we take the time to build the appropriate safety systems that stop bad actors as much as we possibly can within the limits of an encrypted service. We’ve started working on these safety systems building on the work we’ve done in WhatsApp, and we’ll discuss them with experts through 2019 and beyond before fully implementing end-to-end encryption. As we learn more from those experts, we’ll finalize how to roll out these systems.

We increasingly believe it’s important to keep information around for shorter periods of time. People want to know that what they share won’t come back to hurt them later, and reducing the length of time their information is stored and accessible will help.

One challenge in building social tools is the “permanence problem”. As we build up large collections of messages and photos over time, they can become a liability as well as an asset. For example, many people who have been on Facebook for a long time have photos from when they were younger that could be embarrassing. But people also really love keeping a record of their lives. And if all posts on Facebook and Instagram disappeared, people would lose access to a lot of valuable knowledge and experiences others have shared.

I believe there’s an opportunity to set a new standard for private communication platforms — where content automatically expires or is archived over time. Stories already expire after 24 hours unless you archive them, and that gives people the comfort to share more naturally. This philosophy could be extended to all private content.

For example, messages could be deleted after a month or a year by default. This would reduce the risk of your messages resurfacing and embarrassing you later. Of course you’d have the ability to change the timeframe or turn off auto-deletion for your threads if you wanted. And we could also provide an option for you to set individual messages to expire after a few seconds or minutes if you wanted.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>In the message, which Mr. Dees showed to a reporter, Mr. Cohen cited Mr. Dees’s “conduct” and the “statements you’ve made in the presence of your co-workers.”

The dismissal, it read, was “for the good of the center.”

On Friday, after The Times asked the S.P.L.C. to respond to its findings, the center offered its fullest account yet of what led to Mr. Dees’s downfall, but it largely refused to address specific allegations or personnel matters.

“We will not respond to individual allegations publicly,” said the center, which declined to make Mr. Cohen available for an interview.

Within hours of the center disclosing the two investigations into Mr. Dees, Mr. Cohen told employees that he would step down. He said in an internal email, “Whatever problems exist at the S.P.L.C. happened on my watch, so I take responsibility for them.”

Mr. Dees said he did not bear a grudge against the organization he helped power for decades, but that he was saddened that his critics “would go to extreme measures” to undermine his career. “I guess I’m a trial lawyer, and so things come and go,” Mr. Dees said. “When the facts are all said and done, my reputation is not going to be hurt.”

The center’s board has hired Tina Tchen, Michelle Obama’s former chief of staff, to assess its workplace culture. In a statement, the board chairman, Bryan Fair, said that recent events had been “an eye-opening reminder that the walk toward justice must sometimes start at your own front door, and force you to look at your past so you can improve your future.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Archaeological shows, whether large or small, are like icebergs. What you see is the tip of a mountain of history submerged in the ocean of time. “The World Between Empires: Art and Identity in the Ancient Middle East,” which opens at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Monday, is like that. It’s a big show, packed with surprises, and connected equally to the present and the past. And in this case the tip takes the shape of a wide-open field with a long road running through it.

The terrain is dominated by giants, ancient competing superpowers seen late in their long histories: imperial Rome to the west and Parthia in Iran to the east. But unusually for a show in which they are featured, the focus here is not on them. It’s on a patchwork of subject cultures — roughly corresponding to modern-day Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen — that lay between them.

Often those cultures are themselves presented as if shaped by the Roman and Parthian presence. This exhibition offers a different picture. Yes, imperial influence is there, and often strong, but far from being all-determinin g, each of the cultures considered borrows imperial symbols and styles, but partially, selectively, critically — grafting them onto local traditions. The results include distinctive new grass-roots hybrids, in which conflicted responses to domination, even outright resistance to it, can sometimes be read.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>MONTREAL — The Quebec government on Thursday proposed a bill barring public school teachers, judges, police officers and other public employees from wearing religious symbols including Muslim head scarves while working, a move that could aggravate simmering cultural tensions in the province.

The Quebec premier, François Legault, has said the bill, which also applies to Catholic crosses, Jewish skullcaps and Sikh turbans, was necessary to preserve Quebec’s secular values and identity. It is expected to pass in the Quebec legislature, where his right-leaning party has a majority.

Religious and human rights advocates immediately attacked the legislation as a breach of religious freedom. Some said it conflicted with the image Canada has projected as an open, multicultural society.

“Every young person who aspires to a be a judge, a teacher or a police officer and wears a head scarf will think that they have no future in this province and it will push Muslims away from Quebec,” said Shahad Salman, a young lawyer who wears a head scarf and whose parents emigrated to Montreal from Iraq in the 1980s.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Attorney General William P. Barr told congressional leaders in a letter late Friday that the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has concluded his inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election and delivered a report to the Department of Justice.

See the letter here and read a transcript below.

[What’s next? We break it down as well as the major moments in the case. And here’s the latest analysis on Trump and the Mueller report.]

I write to notify you pursuant to 28 C.F.R. § 600.9(a)(3) that Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III has concluded his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and related matters. In addition to this notification, the Special Counsel regulations require that I provide you with “a description and explanation of instances (if any) in which the Attorney General” or acting Attorney General “concluded that a proposed action by a Special Counsel was so inappropriate or unwarranted under established Departmental practices that it should not be pursued.” 28 C.F.R. § 600.9(a)(3). There were no such instances during the Special Counsel’s investigation.

The Special Counsel has submitted to me today a “confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions” he has reached, as required by 28 C.F.R. § 600.8(c). I am reviewing the report and anticipate that I may be in a position to advise you of the Special Counsel’s principal conclusions as soon as this weekend.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>O.K., sure, but why shift our focus?

According to conventional wisdom about time management, you’re supposed to set goals for when you want to finish a task. I decided to try it for this article. The target was 1,200 words, so I sat down at 8 a.m. and gave myself three hours, which would allow me to write at the leisurely pace of six words per minute. I then spent the next six minutes writing a grand total of zero words, staring at a flashing cursor. The only task I completed was a Google search of whether the cursor was named in honor of all the writers who have cursed it. (Yes, I know you’re mocking me, you poor blinking excuse for a rectangle.) Then I wondered how many words I actually type per minute and took a typing test. I wasn’t happy with my score, so I took another … and another.

Eventually I got frustrated and shifted to attention management. E.B. White once wrote: “I arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve (or save) the world and a desire to enjoy (or savor) the world. This makes it hard to plan the day.” But in my research, I’ve found that productive people don’t agonize about which desire to pursue. They go after both simultaneously, gravitating toward projects that are personally interesting and socially meaningful.

So instead of focusing on how quickly I wanted to finish this article, I asked why I agreed to write it in the first place: I might learn something new when synthesizing the research; I’d finally have somewhere to point people when they ask about productivity; and it might help some of those people. That led me to start thinking about specific people who might read this, which reminded me of Michael. Boom.

Often our productivity struggles are caused not by a lack of efficiency, but a lack of motivation. Productivity isn’t a virtue. It’s a means to an end. It’s only virtuous if the end is worthy. If productivity is your goal, you have to rely on willpower to push yourself to get a task done. If you pay attention to why you’re excited about the project and who will benefit from it, you’ll be naturally pulled into it by intrinsic motivation.

But how do I stay on task if I’m not worried about time?

Attention management also involves noticing where you get things done. I grew up in Michigan, and when I went back there for grad school, I tried to convince a friend from the West Coast to join me.

“It’s too cold and gray,” she said after a visit during a snowstorm. She then went off to Stanford. That next Michigan winter was the coldest, grayest season I could remember, and I have never been more productive. There was nothing to do but work!

Sure enough, a series of studies led by Julia Lee (now at Michigan) show that bad weather is good for productivity because we’re less likely to be distracted by the thought of going outside. Researchers found that on days when it rained, Japanese bank employees finished transactions faster, and on days when the weather was bad in America, people were more efficient in correcting spelling errors in an essay. With that in mind, I deliberately waited to start writing this article until the day after a snowstorm, when the melting slush outside my window was not appealing.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Mr. Avenatti was released Monday evening on $300,000 bond and under several conditions, including restrictions on travel. In a brief news conference after his release, Mr. Avenatti said he was “highly confident” that when all the evidence was presented, he would be “fully exonerated, and justice will be done.”

A veteran plaintiffs lawyer, Mr. Avenatti rose to fame in March 2018 when he filed a lawsuit against Mr. Trump on behalf of Ms. Daniels, who said that she had an affair with Mr. Trump and then received a hush-money payment leading up to the 2016 election.

Mr. Avenatti became a fixture on cable news, leveraging Ms. Daniels’s case to build his own profile as a foil to Mr. Trump. He was even taken half-seriously when he declared that he was interested in making a presidential run in 2020.

Ms. Daniels’s suit, which sought to invalidate a nondisclosure agreement, was dismissed by a federal judge in California this month, and a separate defamation suit Mr. Avenatti filed against Mr. Trump on Ms. Daniels’s behalf was dismissed late last year. The discussion about Ms. Daniels, however, has remained a leading sore point for the Trump administration, as checks made out to her with the president’s signature on them were given to Congress last month by his former personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, who has pleaded guilty to federal charges.

Last September, Mr. Avenatti inserted himself into the confirmation hearings of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. The week before Justice Kavanaugh was confirmed, Mr. Avenatti announced that he had a new client, Julie Swetnick. Ms. Swetnick said that she had witnessed sexual misconduct by Justice Kavanaugh and some of his friends at high school parties in the Washington area in the early 1980s, when she was a college student in Maryland.

As Mr. Avenatti’s national profile grew, so did his legal and financial troubles.

He was arrested in Los Angeles in November on suspicion of domestic violence, which he called an effort to intimidate him, though he was not charged with a crime. His firm, formerly known as Eagan Avenatti, has repeatedly filed for bankruptcy, most recently on March 7, in Santa Ana, Calif.

The charging documents in the Nike case refer to an unnamed co-conspirator, another lawyer who worked with Mr. Avenatti. That lawyer is Mark Geragos, according to people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the continuing investigation.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Tennessee toted into the tournament painful memories of last season’s exit, when as a No. 3 seed it was upset in the second round by Loyola-Chicago. The Volunteers struggled in a 77-70 first-round victory against No. 15 Colgate, and Coach Rick Barnes said Sunday that he thought his team has carried “a little extra stress” to go deeper this year. That stress seemed absent in the first half against Iowa, when they complemented swarming defense with inside-out balance, racing to a 44-19 lead.

Trailing by 21 at halftime, Iowa opted not to run with Tennessee in the second half. Slowing down the pace, the Hawkeyes fed the ball inside more to Tyler Cook and Luka Garza. Jordan Bohannon’s three free throws — on what seemed a questionable foul call on Lamonte Turner, who appeared to have blocked a 3-point attempt cleanly — tied the score for the first time, at 67-67, with 2:39 remaining, and then Iowa overcame a 4-point deficit in the final 58 seconds to send the game into overtime.

Had the Hawkeyes won, they would have matched Brigham Young’s comeback against Iona in 2012.

“We know it’s not going to be perfection — it never is,” Iowa Coach Fran McCaffery said. “But what you hope to get is a perfect effort. And that’s what we got.”

The other three No. 2 seeds — Michigan, Michigan State and Kentucky — won their second-round games by an average of 13.7 points, and only Kentucky was seriously tested, by Wofford. If the Volunteers are to progress to their first Final Four, they must play better than they have across their first 85 minutes of play — and they know it.

“The way we started the game, that’s the team we win,” guard Admiral Schofield said. “The way we finished the game, we can’t have that. That’s what got us beat throughout the season. The team you saw in the first half is what won 31 games. We have to be consistent in that aspect. But this time of year, it’s about winning, about surviving and advancing.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]

This week came the very dispiriting news that despite years of agonized debate over how to diversify New York City’s specialized high schools, only a small percentage of black and Latino children gained admission to them for the upcoming academic year.

A continuation of the status quo would have been bleak enough, but there were signs of regression. Even though, for example, the number of Latino children who took the entrance exam (the sole criteria for acceptance) increased this year, the number admitted actually went down. Of the 4,798 spots awarded in these schools in total, only 190 went to black students.

As ever, the focus quickly landed on the gaping disparities at Stuyvesant. There, just seven of the 895 children admitted were black. Stuyvesant is the most selective of the eight schools in the specialized high school system; it requires at least a score of 557 (out of 800) on the entrance exam known as the SHSAT. This is the highest cutoff. Fewer than 4 percent of those who take the test qualify for admission to Stuyvesant, which accepts a smaller percentage of its applicants than Harvard, Stanford or M.I.T.

That has given the school a disproportionate role in discussions of improving social mobility.

Presumably, a Stuyvesant graduate will have a better than average chance at getting into Harvard. And a great number of people in the pundit class believe that a more equitably balanced Harvard leads to a more equitably balanced America. But even if every spot in the Ivy League were filled by an exceptional student from a low-income family, a mere 60,000 or so American undergraduates would see their fortunes rise. Something like six million others would be left struggling in underfunded community colleges with typically poor rates of graduation.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>ARCADIA, Calif. — Santa Anita will impose new rules to scrutinize horses training on its racetrack and add a director of equine welfare after the deaths of 21 horses since Dec. 26.

The main dirt track and turf courses were in a third day of examination on Saturday in an effort to uncover what may have led to the series of catastrophic breakdowns. The racetrack remains closed indefinitely for racing.

The inner training track, which has not had any breakdowns, was open for horses to jog and gallop only for the second straight day.

It was supposed to be a huge day of racing on Saturday at the historic track. But the San Felipe Stakes for 3-year-old Kentucky Derby hopefuls and the Santa Anita Handicap for older horses were scuttled when the track was closed on Tuesday.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Q: My landlord no longer allows delivery people to leave unattended packages for tenants in the building. Carriers cannot leave packages with our 24-hour lobby attendant, nor can they go upstairs and leave them in front of apartment doors. Instead, we have to reschedule deliveries for when someone is home. Is this legal?

A: As New Yorkers order more goods online, buildings have to figure out where to store all those boxes. A 200-unit building may receive around 50 packages a day, and more during the holidays, with a box waiting an average of 16 hours before its recipient retrieves it, according to Georgianna Oliver, the chief executive of Package Concierge, a storage locker company.

As draconian as your landlord’s solution to this common problem may seem, your rights to fight it may be limited. Market-rate tenants would have no right to challenge the policy unless their lease included a provision guaranteeing package delivery, which is unlikely. Rent-regulated tenants could file a complaint with the Division of Housing and Community Renewal, the state agency that oversees such apartments, on the grounds that the policy amounts to a reduction of services. However, the agency may find the issue too minor to warrant a rent reduction or an order to restore the service, according to David Hershey-Webb, a lawyer who represents tenants.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WASHINGTON — For years, the Pentagon has maintained that no civilians have been killed in American airstrikes and raids in Somalia. Amnesty International, in a new report released on Tuesday, put the death toll at 14 since 2017 alone.

The report linked the killings to President Trump’s decision to relax rules for preventing civilian casualties during American counterterrorism strikes in Somalia. Amnesty said it examined five airstrikes that killed 14 civilians and injured eight.

“In the incidents presented in this report, civilians were killed and injured in attacks that may have violated international humanitarian law and could, in some cases, constitute war crimes,” the report said.

It called into question repeated claims by United States Africa Command that there have been no civilian casualties from American strikes against the extremist Islamist group known as the Shabab. The report also attributed the discrepancy to failures by the American military and the Somali government to adequately investigate claims that civilians were killed in airstrikes and raids by United States forces.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Looking ahead: The announcement of the charges came two days before a presidential election. The governing party — tainted by the scandal — is behind in the polls .

Here’s what else is happening

U.S. Congress: The Senate, in a bipartisan rebuke, voted to overturn President Trump’s declaration of a national emergency at the southern border to fund his wall. The Senate vote was the first time Congress has blocked a presidential emergency declaration and almost certainly sets up Mr. Trump’s first veto. And the House voted 420-to-0 to demand the public release of the report that the special counsel, Robert Mueller, is assigned to submit to the attorney general.

Climate change: Students in more than 100 countries will be protesting climate change today in what could be one of the largest demonstrations yet against global environmental policies. It all started with a shy 16-year-old in Sweden.

E.U. Parliament: The president of the body, Antonio Tajani, incited outrage and apologized after putting a positive slant on Benito Mussolini, Italy’s fascist former leader.

Germany: Volkswagen’s chief executive, Herbert Diess, apologized after using a phrase that echoed a Nazi-era slogan, “Arbeit macht frei,” or “Work sets you free,” emblazoned on the gates of Auschwitz. “Ebit macht frei,” he repeatedly told hundreds of managers at an internal company event. Ebit is an acronym for “earnings before interest and taxes.”

Northern Ireland: Officials said that one former British soldier would be prosecuted on murder charges in connection with the massacre of unarmed civilians by British forces nearly 50 years ago in Londonderry, an event that came to be known as Bloody Sunday.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Each time I visit my parents’ house, I find myself mining the drawers of my childhood dresser for gems from the early aughts. Many of these items were bat mitzvah gifts — precious handbags, dainty pearl earrings — the kind of appropriate, just-so pieces that a 13-year-old could conceivably wear but that were more likely gifted with the future in mind. Coming of Age, the designer Amanda Lurie’s elegant and playfully nostalgic new line of accessories, reminds me of these beloved pieces.

Inspired by Lurie’s childhood in Miami, the geometry of dominoes and dice and the stunning plaid textiles Lurie found on a 2017 trip to Sri Lanka, Coming of Age (COA NYC, for short) bags are made of iridescent gingham silk taffeta sourced from the garment district in New York. The Everyday Bag has a structured, boxy shape reminiscent of a lunchbox. The union of luxurious fabric and a utilitarian shape makes it as easy to imagine carrying the bag to the grocery store as to a party — and, because of the sheen of the fabric from which they are made, the bags appear differently in different lights. Look once and they evoke ’90s Palm Beach preppiness. Look again, and they call to mind the vibrant crafted goods one might find on a trip to Mexico City or Buenos Aires.

“I want to design for what ‘coming-of-age’ means to me,” Lurie says. “Designing for a little girl or my grandma — any age can wear it, and any person can wear it.” For Lurie, who also designs for the New York-based brand Priscavera and has worked as a designer for Coach and Sandy Liang, launching her first collection is a growth story in and of itself. “The idea behind the brand came from my personal journey — of coming-of-age and how it started for me. I’ve been working and figuring out who I am and what speaks to me,” Lurie said. Currently, she is selling the Everyday Bag through the brand’s Instagram, and on April 1, she will launch her website, where bags in additional silhouettes, and eventually belts, will be available. — HILARY REID</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“Bending Toward Justice: The Birmingham Church Bombing That Changed the Course of Civil Rights” is a valuable addition to the historical record of Alabama’s role as the battleground state of the civil rights revolution. It provides an inside look at how Jones, a former United States attorney from Birmingham, and his role model, the former Alabama attorney general Bill Baxley, sent to prison three Birmingham Klansmen who murdered four black girls by dynamiting their church on Sept. 15, 1963. The four children, aged 11 to 14 — Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair, Carole Robertson and Cynthia Morris Wesley — died instantly in a women’s restroom where they were preparing for Sunday school.

Without Jones and Baxley, both white men born in Alabama and educated in the state’s law schools, the murders of the children killed on that “bloody Sunday” and memorialized in Spike Lee’s wrenching film “4 Little Girls” would have gone forever unpunished. (I was interviewed in Lee’s film, and my reports that first identified the four bombers by name were nominated for a Pulitzer Prize in investigative reporting by this newspaper in 1983.)

With this book, Jones invites us — indeed, challenges us — to look anew at the central paradox of the case. The three bombers were all convicted on evidence from confidential interviews and wiretaps conducted by F.B.I. agents who were on the scene in Birmingham in the mid-60s. Yet the agency’s Washington leadership sought at every opportunity to impede Jones, Baxley and their chief investigator, the former Alabama state detective Bob Eddy.

During the past year, I was lucky enough to talk to all three men in Alabama, and Jones’s account provides an opportunity to revisit both the remarkable dark-horse campaign that made him the first Democratic senator from the South’s reddest state in nearly three decades, as well as this tormenting saga of justice long delayed by Justice Department ineptitude and the personal malfeasance of the longtime F.B.I. director J. Edgar Hoover.

Jones’s account is evenhanded to a fault: He fails to emphasize the villainous role of Hoover as the chief reason that Robert “Dynamite Bob” Chambliss and his two thuggish accomplices, Tommy Blanton and Bobby Frank Cherry, were all old men before Baxley and Jones were able to put them behind bars in a series of three dramatic trials conducted in 1977, 2001 and 2002. A Justice Department task force reviewing F.B.I. misconduct in investigating crimes in Alabama proved that Hoover stalled the investigation in 1965, causing a delay that continued well beyond his death in 1972.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The shootings that killed at least 49 people at two mosques in New Zealand on Friday have placed new scrutiny on New Zealand’s gun laws and sparked a fervent debate about whether they were a factor in the gunman’s decision to carry out his attack there.

The man was identified in court papers as Brenton Harrison Tarrant, 28, and officials have said he was an Australian citizen, which has led to comparisons between gun laws in Australia and in New Zealand.

While New Zealand’s laws governing the purchase of semiautomatic rifles are more restrictive than those in the United States, the country is much freer with firearms than Australia is, allowing most guns to be purchased without requiring them to be tracked.

“New Zealand is almost alone with the United States in not registering 96 percent of its firearms — and those are its most common firearms, the ones most used in crimes,” said Philip Alpers of GunPolicy.org, a clearinghouse for gun law data worldwide. “There are huge gaps in New Zealand law, even if some of its laws are strong.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Re “Rising Far-Right Extremism in America,” by Thomas T. Cullen (Op-Ed, Feb. 23 ), in which he cites statistics showing an alarming increase in hate crimes by far-right and white supremacist groups:

Not enough attention has been paid to President Trump’s rallies as a breeding ground for inflaming the passions of such extremism.

These rallies are dismissed as circus acts, but their power is insidious — dramas that agitate the hatred, anger and bigotry of a dictator’s followers. It is a parasitic relationship: Supporters of President Trump feed off his fame and wealth, which they know they will never have; he feeds off their adulation to validate the artifice of his presidency.

Eric Hoffer, in his classic “The True Believer,” attributes mass movements to discontent fueled by frustration. The resurgence of overt white supremacist sympathies is evidence of deep-seated frustration released into action by a president whose only motive in life seems to be self-glorification.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>But the announcement was also greeted with some skepticism. An expert on restaurant lobbying who requested anonymity because of McDonald’s power in the industry said the chain’s repositioning appeared to be at least in part a political publicity stunt. More than 90 percent of McDonald’s restaurants worldwide are owned and operated by independent franchisees, according to the company’s website. It is those franchisees, not McDonald’s Corp.’s bottom line, that the expert worried could be most affected.

Officials with the National Owners Association, an independent advocacy group of McDonald’s franchisees, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. A spokesman for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said it would not comment “on individual company decisions.”

The National Restaurant Association has argued that only a small fraction of food service workers earn the federal minimum wage, and that most get a raise within six months.

“The National Restaurant Association is the largest food service trade association in the world, representing every aspect of the industry,” the association said in a statement on Wednesday. “Our members are as diverse as the communities they serve, and the economies of every region are different.” McDonald’s, the association added, is “a valued member.”

In her letter, which was first reported by Politico, Ms. Gent, the McDonald’s vice president, said the average starting wage in the company’s corporate-owned stores is already more than $10 per hour, above the federal minimum set a decade ago. Though the company does not control the wages franchisees pay their employees, she said the average starting wages for those workers were “likely similar.”

“We recognize that overall wages reflect the realities of different communities and that elected leaders have the responsibility to set, debate and change mandated minimum wages,” the letter said.

Terrence Wise, a McDonald’s worker in Kansas City and a leader of the Fight for $15 campaign, said its fight would continue even after the announcement.

Workers have long called both for a $15 minimum wage and union rights, he said, “and we’re not going to stop marching, speaking out and striking until we win both.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>It is Wednesday evening at rush hour and Mikaela Shiffrin, perhaps the most dominant athlete in the world, strolled unobserved through a crowded Central Park.

After shattering a host of records on the just completed Alpine skiing World Cup tour — most victories in a season (17); most career women’s slalom wins (40); only skier to claim the overall, super-G, giant slalom and slalom championship in one winter — Shiffrin arrived in New York for a round of appearances on morning and late-night television talk shows.

Since she is obscured by a helmet and reflective goggles while competing in a sport mostly contested in Europe, it could be a given that she would not draw much attention during a casual walkabout in her native country.

But that may soon change.

With Lindsey Vonn’s retirement last month, Shiffrin, at 24, is the unquestioned face of American ski racing. Moreover, her ever-escalating, dazzling accomplishments are becoming so outrageous, she has a chance to enlarge the crossover celebrity status that Vonn achieved.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>In a shifting of priorities at NASA, the Trump administration’s proposed budget for next year adds $600 million for an outpost high above the moon and the beginning of development for landers to take astronauts back to the lunar surface.

But in keeping with the administration’s preference for the private sector, the proposal emphasizes a more commercial approach for moon exploration as it seeks budgetary reductions in other areas. It postpones a major upgrade for the giant rocket NASA is developing, and NASA’s science missions could face a 10 percent reduction, including another attempt to cancel an upcoming flagship telescope. Congress has restored such cuts in earlier years.

While many other domestic programs face sizable cuts in the Trump administration’s budget, NASA overall fares well by comparison. The budget seeks a little more than $21 billion for fiscal year 2020, which starts Oct. 1. That is $1 billion more than the administration proposed for this fiscal year, but $500 million less than the $21.5 billion that Congress ultimately decided.

In an address at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Jim Bridenstine, the space agency’s administrator, repeatedly described the budget as “strong” and said, “We have strong bipartisan support in both chambers of Congress.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>A stronger sense of location — or of migrating between locations — came through in the other new work, Mr. Royon’s boisterous “Homebound/Alaala.” Stacks of multicolored moving boxes, continually rearranged by the cast of 11, suggest a long journey in progress. Mr. Royon and Amanda Gladu designed the attractive scenery; Ms. Gladu also designed the costumes, using material from Anthill Fabric Gallery, a company that works to sustainably preserve Filipino weaving traditions.

To an upbeat playlist of music by Filipino artists, the dancers hurtle through fast, fluid phrases, at one point breaking into song and bickering, like a big family. Raúl Contreras and Omar Rivéra find a moment of privacy, enmeshing in a duet that, when others barge in from the wings, feels like a secret; they abruptly part ways. But if there are any fractures in the group, they seem to be healed by the end, when everyone joins together in a finale that puts pairs of flip-flops to percussive use.

“Homebound” is a lively, if not entirely coherent, addition to the Ballet Hispánico repertory. But the program’s high point was an older work made new: Ms. Lopez Ochoa’s “Sombrerísimo,” originally for six men, restaged with six women. While doing tricks with bowler hats, Tuesday’s cast shattered the idea, too pervasive even in contemporary ballet, that women should be lifted, not do the lifting. Nailing the work’s athletic partnering, they rivaled the strength and swagger of their predecessors.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“Accidentally Brave” does not offer answers. For one thing, Ms. Corman provides few details about Mr. Alexander. What happened to him is “not my story to tell,” she says. And though she breaks her rule just enough to suggest the existence of explanatory events that “happened” in his youth, she does not in any way attempt to inhabit him the way she inhabits herself, her children and her friends, both stalwart and fair-weather. She never even mentions his name.

Given her skill at investing stage characters with palpable humanity — her daughter’s scream is both bloodcurdling and heartbreaking — this denial feels like an especially powerful expression of anger. And yet the real twist in the tale (though it’s not a spoiler) is that she and Mr. Alexander remain married, and have in some ways improved their relationship through the restart forced upon them.

[What’s new onstage and off: Sign up for our Theater Update newsletter]

That’s a development that might have been easier to understand had it been dramatized, in scenes that did not quarantine important parts of the story and that inched toward resolution in real time. I wanted to see, rather than just hear as an anecdote, how Ms. Corman came to understand her husband as someone who isn’t evil but unwell, poisoned by pornography. And how she came to stand by him, as her wedding vows promised, in sickness, not just in health.

Ms. Corman, a professional actor since her teens — and herself the victim of sexual harassment at a young age — could certainly have performed such a script. With her nanosecond timing, she has nailed tricky ensemble scenes as both a sophisticated sidekick (in “Next Fall”) and an artless matron (in “The Babylon Line”), among many others.

Here, though, the form forces her to create an illusion of drama through a kind of solo montage. Several customized bravura sequences show her toggling with daredevil facility among various characters and moods. She smash-cuts from devastation to furor to false calm as if road testing them to see which is most useful.

Though you can’t help responding to the intensity of these acting moments, there is something slick about “Accidentally Brave” that comes with the confessional monologue genre. Ms. Corman may hate the word “journeys” but her script is not free of self-help jargon. More than once she offers the de rigueur (yet unnecessary) excuse that in telling her story she hopes “to be of service.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>They knew that their dad had gone into surgery. So they knew that he had definitely been at the hospital at some point. But they hadn’t heard about their brother. So they get to the hospital. And their dad’s name isn’t anywhere, and their brother’s name isn’t anywhere. So they basically just start rushing from room to room on a hunt to try and find either of them.

But the mosque was integral to kind of bringing — In our life, it was beyond childhood. I was probably there more than most every week. You know? How did Atta wrestle with that in high school? Because high school’s a test for everyone. It is. This is kind of that struggle with identity in kind of a Western context. He went to the same high school as I did. He was really, really effective at kind of, you know, blending in and being just like any other Kiwi, but also in saying that he’s — he was one to absolutely embrace his Muslim identity. And he kind of brought that around with him in a really effective way, in the way that it’s relatable. So I think, obviously, there’s a bit of a struggle to assimilation or the opposite. But I think, for me, I’m not the most sporty person out there. And it’s interesting because, I mean, everything I was interested in was — — not really what defined Christchurch Boys’ High. Like, I did drama and debating and all these kind of more cultural things that literally no one respected. So one thing he kind of advised me was that getting into sport really does unlock doors socially. And absolutely in hindsight, I can completely say that he wasn’t wrong. Being into his sports just made him more accessible to people that he otherwise wouldn’t be. And we often kind of discussed our high school experiences. And I’ve always lived through kind of his mistakes and his experiences. And he literally was like my second father. He’d gone through a lot of this stuff. And so, you know, he was always teaching us from his mistakes. That’s going to be something we’re going to really miss. I mean, I’m pretty stubborn in general. And I don’t really take advice from a lot of people. But any time I want some advice, I’d go to him for everything. And he’d always have the answer for it. And it would be the perfect answer every time. How do you begin to process something like this? I mean — Yeah, look, I’m going to be totally honest with you. I think processing it is going to take a very long time. Yeah, we haven’t, 100 percent haven’t started processing yet. I mean, the first day and the second day were pretty tough. But I think we’ve kind of pulled it together a little bit for the sake of Mum and Father. But it’s going to be a long, long road. And I think things are going to come up every now and again, where, I don’t know, for me, it’s going to be, oh, man, I want some advice, or I want to talk to Atta about this, so — he’s not here kind of thing. I’m sure that’s going to be years of pain for all of us. I don’t think there’s enough words to describe what it means for them and for us.

The only reason that I’m doing architecture is because I saw one of his graphics projects pinned up on his wall. I mean, Atta actually kind of hated it. It was, like, this yellow, Simpsons-looking house. [LAUGHS] And it’s pinned up on his wall. And I just saw the floor plans and the sketches. And I was so inspired. And interestingly, it’s something he sacrificed to stay close to home. He didn’t want to go to Wellington to study architecture because he didn’t want to be far from home. He wanted two things. He wanted to be an architect or a dentist. And this one’s an architect, and I’m a dentist. And Atta put both of those dreams on hold because he didn’t want to split the family up.

I felt that this was the man I want to marry. I was very sure that I wanted Atta to be the father of my children because he had every single thing that I wanted in a man. So where was the wedding? And tell me about it. What was it like? Aw, the best — best part for me was when Farah sang to him. We didn’t know she could sing. That’s something we didn’t know about her at the time. And no one expected it. She kept it as a surprise. And she walked in partway through. We heard some singing. We didn’t realize it was her. But she walked in, singing a beautiful song in Arabic and English. And she sang it to him. And he cried. And we all cried. And it was a beautiful moment.

How do you explain to Aya — what have you told her? Um, so far, Aya has been busy with a lot of children around. Just maybe two days ago, she woke up in the middle of the night crying, and she was calling for her dad. And then I calmed her down. And she slept back. And then the other day, she heard the plane, and she’s like, Baba! I’m like, yeah. And she’s like, Auckland? Because just Monday, at night, he went to Auckland, to where Abdallah is, his brother. So I’m like, yeah, Mama, Baba, he — yeah, he’s gone, but not to Auckland this time. He went to jannah, which is heaven. So for now, this is what I’m going to tell her, that he traveled to this place, but we can’t call him, and he’s gone to this place where it’s heaven, not Auckland. [LAUGHS] So right now, we’re just waiting to get the call from the police to say you can come and see the body now. And after that, we can get started on the steps towards the burial. And after that, we’re just going to wait.

They read out the lists of names in groups of five. You’re used to seeing at a funeral a cluster of family around a grave. But what was so striking here is that you saw five clusters of family around five graves. And then you had 10. And people were trying to have this kind of private farewell where they were all circled really closely together around each grave. But they were so close to the other families doing the same thing. And then they would encourage them to file out when they were finished, and they would read out the next five names.

Before Atta’s body was brought in, his father, who I recognized from pictures, was wheeled in his wheelchair. He’s been recovering from gunshot wounds in hospital. But obviously, he was able to come out for his son’s funeral. He was all in black. And he just waited by the grave. And then the women filed in a little way behind him, Farah and Maysoon, Atta’s mom, Haneen, his sister, and some other relatives. And they were all supporting each other and holding onto each other. And then Atta’s body was brought in. And I knew it was him because I could see Abdallah among those carrying the coffin. They had these open coffins with low sides, so you could see the shrouded body inside. And then Atta’s dad, Mohammad, supporting himself on a cane, got out of the wheelchair and stood by the grave as Atta’s body was lowered in. And everyone had their hands on him, it seemed like — everyone had a hand on his back. And they were all supporting each other. And they all just stood there for a long time, surrounded by all of these other families doing the same. And the sheikh sang “Allahu akbar,” God is great, before the bodies were lowered.

And Abdallah, Atta’s brother, was going around and giving everyone hugs, but these really, completely stop-still hugs. He would hold each person. And they would just stand really still for a long time. Then a floral arrangement was placed on the grave. And the men filed out. They still had their hands on each other’s backs. The women came to the grave for a moment and stood there too. Outside the burial area were waiting Atta’s football teammates. They filed out. And then the next group of bodies was brought in. And that kept happening until the funeral was over.

Not long after I got home, I got a text from Abdallah. And he just wanted to make sure I had made it into the funeral O.K. I told him I had. And then I asked him how he was doing. And he replied, “All I can say is that I feel at peace.”

We haven’t lost everything. We still have each other. And we’re going to have to get through it together. There’s no other choice, you know? Life has to go on. You’ve got to keep moving. We do have faith, even if it’s maybe not quite as strong as my dad’s faith. We do have faith. We believe in the afterlife. We believe he’s in a better place. And we want to meet him there. So I just hope that, inshallah, one day, we’ll be again reunited in Jannah, in heaven. And this is what will give me the strength to, you know, to continue our dreams and goals that we could not achieve together and that we had already set. And I’m going to raise our daughter to know who her father was. We’re very proud of her father. And yeah, I love him. We’ll always do.

      <TEXT>LONDON — The founder and chief executive of the British fashion chain Ted Baker resigned on Monday after current and former employees accused him of inappropriate behavior.

Employees said the executive, Ray Kelvin, would regularly try to massage people in the office, insist on long hugs with staff members and ask employees for sex, according to a petition that started circulating in December. The petition also said the company’s human resources department had ignored complaints about the behavior.

“Harassment at Ted Baker is well documented but willfully ignored by those in charge,” the authors of the petition wrote. The petition called for the company to adopt procedures that would allow workers to report harassment to an independent, external organization.

Mr. Kelvin denied the allegations, but agreed on Monday to resign immediately as chief executive and director of Ted Baker, the company said. He had taken a voluntary leave of absence in December.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>ATLANTA — Pick a strategy Democrats are considering ahead of 2020, and Stacey Abrams’s narrow loss in the Georgia governor’s race serves either as a blueprint or a warning sign.

Democrats are debating how much voting issues can swing an election, whether identity politics are energizing or polarizing, and if it is better to double down on politically engaged women, people of color and left-leaning voters or tack to the center. All of those played out in a fight that catapulted Ms. Abrams to national attention. The open question is what lesson to draw: that her strategy was more successful than any recent Democrat who ran statewide, or that it still was not enough to tug Georgia — and perhaps the country — into the blue column.

For Ms. Abrams, the answer is unequivocal: Her campaign turned out record numbers of black, Latino and Asian voters, and she also won a larger share of the white vote than President Barack Obama or scions of Georgia political royalty like Jason Carter and Michelle Nunn. She actively courted voters and highlighted issues central to an emerging demographic majority that proved elusive for Democrats in 2016.

[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]

“We recognized that we could center communities of color, marginalized communities, and talk about their needs without alienating the white community,” she said in a recent extended interview. “That’s been a false narrative that’s been part of politics, especially in the South, for a very long time.”</TEXT>

No, this year, the best college basketball team from California might just be the University of California, Irvine.

Yes, you read that right. The Anteaters. (Zot! Zot! Zot!)

“We’re one of the top teams on the West Coast, and we have proven we’re probably the best team in California,” Ryan Badrtalei, an assistant coach at U.C. Irvine, said in a telephone interview on Monday.

Of course, claims like these are hotly debated at this time of year. But on Sunday, the N.C.A.A. selection committee announced the 68 teams that will play in the Division I men’s basketball tournament, and only two of them were from California: U.C. Irvine and Saint Mary’s, which earned its bid by winning the West Coast Conference tournament.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>MAZAR-I-SHARIF, Afghanistan — The Taliban carried out the biggest known capture of Afghan soldiers of the war, taking 150 prisoners after they chased units into neighboring Turkmenistan and that country forced them back, Afghan officials said on Sunday.

The operation took place in the northwestern Afghan province of Badghis, and brought to 190 the number of soldiers captured by insurgents in the hotly contested district of Murghab — with 16 more soldiers killed — in less than a week.

Last Monday, an entire Afghan Army company was killed or captured there. By Saturday, its defenders said the district had fallen mostly into Taliban control, though Afghan forces were still holding the district’s government center.

The latest capture was perhaps the biggest setback for the Afghan security forces since a Taliban offensive in August in the southeastern city of Ghazni killed as many as 200 soldiers and police officers, but few prisoners were taken then. The biggest recent capture of soldiers by the Taliban was about 50 who surrendered after a siege of their base, known as Chinese Camp, in Faryab Province, also in August.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>This willingness to adopt a policy position not out of conviction but out of a desire to conform to partisan priorities reflects an urge, they write, “to bolster and protect valued political identities by expressing and rationalizing the viewpoints cued to be consistent with these identities.”

In an email, Lelkes wrote that he and his co-authors felt it important “to be careful about causal reasoning.” They concluded their article with this commentary:

These two papers raise a set of basic questions about group identity: Why are partisan divisions sharpening now and are these conflicts likely to become more aggravated?

Robert Kurzban, the author of “The Hidden Agenda of the Political Mind,” argues that domestic politics have taken on a moralistic, judgmental cast:

Any deviation, Kurzban continued in an email, is likely to be severely punished:

Steven Pinker, a professor of psychology at Harvard, argues that it is the activation of group identity — of the friend-enemy type, about which I have written before — that is driving hostile polarization:

Pinker cited the questions raised in the work of Kurzban and Peter DeScioli, a political scientist at Stony Brook, wondering

DeScioli provided some answers to the question in his replies to my queries:

Our coalitional psychology goes far beyond a simple distinction between us and them. We form coalitions nested within coalitions, and our loyalties can suddenly shift. Our minds keep track of other individuals’ allies and enemies in an ornate network of loyalties. Conflicts routinely occur within a group, and generally more often than against outgroups. We use aggression as a tactic both within and between groups, and we do so cautiously, weighing the costs and benefits. Our coalitional psychology is more like a Machiavellian playbook of strategies than a simple reflex of hostility toward an outgroup. Partisan hostility is certainly a form of coalitional aggression rooted in evolved strategies, but so are the prudent strategies of peace and compromise.

Moral condemnation and approbation can both be useful to encourage productive cooperation within a group, but they can also be deeply destructive when used to demonize and humiliate outsiders.

John Hibbing, a political scientist at the University of Nebraska, makes the case that polarization has intensified because

While as recently as 30 years ago, there were a fair number of conservative Democrats and liberal Republicans who held views contrary to the majority of their respective parties, Hibbing wrote,

Hibbing dismissed the argument that people have “become tribal because of changes in the media environment.” Instead, he wrote,

Kevin Smith, who is also a political scientist at the University of Nebraska, argues that

For much of the twentieth century, according to this line of thinking, the first world war, the Great Depression, the second world war and the Cold War filled much of the need for an in-group versus out-group configuration. During this period, Smith said, there were consensual “sources of information” and political parties “that were relatively nonideological” with many members “willing to cross the aisle to cut deals.”

In recent years, “a lot of that has gone,” Smith told me. “Political parties are now deeply ideological,” which makes it easier to

When, if ever, will things improve? Jonathan Haidt, a psychologist at N.Y.U., is not optimistic. He emailed:

Two of the most insightful people on evolved human behavior are Leda Cosmides and John Tooby, professors of psychology and anthropology at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

Cosmides and Tooby explore the complexities and ambiguities of moral reasoning in their seminal essay “Groups in Mind: The Coalitional Roots of War and Morality,” which concludes on an appropriately ambiguous note:

In a lengthy email that I cannot fully do justice to in this column, Tooby wrote that everybody

This, in turn, encourages evolved mental programs that support self-advantageous information warfare: Of all the signals an individual hears, and out of all the spontaneous thoughts that teem in our minds, each individual filters, remembers, and broadcasts what benefits her in building up herself and her allies, and downgrades those who are her rivals.

Tooby added: “I think we cannot begin to appreciate how immense and all-encompassing this process is.”

Tooby pointed to group pressure to adopt down the line agreement on issues when there is, in fact, much room for dissent and disagreement:

Even more important, he writes,

Leda Cosmides expressed some of her ideas about the connection between us-and-them thinking and evil, the topic with which I began this column, in an interview that was originally published in a Chilean newspaper in 2001 and still resonates:

She went on:

Since the Enlightenment, people have been trying to build bridges between disciplines, and when they do, new insights are achieved and humanity benefits. Should the healing arts have been kept separate from biology? If they had, we would not have antibiotics and modern medicine. Should psychology be kept separate from biology? If it is, we will never understand how the mind works. As a result, we will never understand how to make war less likely, how to cure autism, how to help people understand risk, or how to prevent racism, to name just a few problems on which evolutionary psychologists are making progress. Indeed, if we keep psychology separate from biology, people will continue to believe that “race” is a sensible concept; in contrast, human population biology tells us that humanity is not divided into distinct “races.”

This work is far from done.

      <TEXT>Whenever Major League Baseball opens a season in Japan, count on the Oakland Athletics to show up. The regular season will start at the Tokyo Dome for the fifth time on Wednesday, and this is the third time in a row that the A’s will be there.

They are never the main draw, but they love it.

“It’s cool how baseball is such a big part of their culture,” outfielder Stephen Piscotty said in Mesa, Ariz., a few days before the A’s left spring training. “I can’t wait. I was just so fired up when I heard we were going.”

The A’s are there, essentially, because the Seattle Mariners and Ichiro Suzuki need an opponent. The Mariners abruptly ended Suzuki’s season last May after 15 lackluster games, but he will be active on Wednesday and Thursday in games that will start at 5:35 a.m. Eastern, and hoping to add to his career hits total of 4,367 in the majors and Japan.

Oakland, meanwhile, is hoping to stage a revival of 2012, when its visit here began an improbable run to a division title — and a three-year playoff streak. The A’s faced Seattle to begin that season and opened with the Boston Red Sox in Tokyo in 2008.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WASHINGTON — The last Supreme Court term ended with a constitutional cliffhanger. In a pair of cases that had the potential to reshape American democracy, the justices refused to decide whether election maps can be so warped by politics that they violate the Constitution.

Instead, the court said, in essence, “Come back next term.”

Next week, a year after the court last heard arguments over whether extreme partisan gerrymandering can cross a constitutional line, the justices will again consider the question.

But something fundamental has changed. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, whose vote was seen as crucial to any decision putting limits on partisan gerrymandering, retired last summer.

In Supreme Court litigation, as in so many things, timing is everything. Had Justice Kennedy stayed on the court, there are good reasons to think he would have been particularly receptive to the plaintiffs’ arguments in one of next week’s cases.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>What are the solutions for reducing disparity?

The main focus is on the test. With the stroke of a pen, Mayor Bill de Blasio could change the admission criteria for the five elite schools created by former Mayor Michael Bloomberg (Stuyvesant is not one of them).

Mr. de Blasio said that option would create a confusing two-tiered system. He wants state lawmakers to change the rules for all the elite high schools. But that path is all but dead in Albany, where the focus is on more popular progressive issues.

Carl Heastie, the Assembly speaker, previously said his conference had not raised the matter because it was divisive: The schools’ alumni organizations and Asian-American families had argued that any change would undermine academics or discriminate against the low-income Asian-Americans who attend the specialized schools in large numbers.

This is what every leader in New York City has tried to do for the last 70 years. It’s not as if the city isn’t trying to improve all schools. That’s the explicit goal of the Department of Education. That is the work that is going on every hour of every day. “Fix the education system” is not the whole story.

What would any changes to admissions criteria be trying to achieve?

More racial diversity at elite high schools. This is a question about who deserves the scarcity of these excellent seats, and how you determine that.

And whatever changes are made, Asian-Americans stand to lose a large number of the seats they hold.

Might this be an issue in the 2021 mayoral election?</TEXT>

      <TEXT>In Netflix’s Cuban-American family sitcom, “One Day at a Time,” Rita Moreno’s punchy one-liners are a complete delight. Justina Machado, who stars as single mom Penelope Alvarez, triggers a sobfest every time she delivers an utterly vulnerable monologue. The series tackles issues from homophobia to colorism with sensitivity and insight, and offers Latinos — members of a woefully underserved demographic — the chance to see ourselves, warts and all, while still reliably delivering laughs and earning rave reviews.

Aside from being a joy to watch, it is a rare example of a television show about the United States-born children and grandchildren of Latin American immigrants. That’s why its cancellation is more than just the loss of a critical darling — it’s an egregious erasure of Latinos at a time when anti-Latino rhetoric floods our political discourse, and it’s a reminder of Netflix’s tepid support for our stories, just when we need them the most.

While the advent of streaming platforms has ushered in an uptick in the overall number of series produced, the promise of increased diversity has not changed much for Latinos. Despite being the largest ethnic minority in the United States and making up nearly 18 percent of the population, Latino roles in digital scripted series constitute a measly 7.2 percent, a figure that’s even lower for broadcast and cable.

“One Day at a Time,” the reboot of Norman Lear’s 1975 sitcom of the same name, launched in 2017 as Netflix’s first foray into United States Latino programming. Not long after season three debuted in February, the co-showrunner Gloria Calderón Kellett took to Twitter to share grim news. In a meeting with the streaming giant, executives affirmed that — despite holding a perfect score from critics on Rotten Tomatoes — they needed to see a spike in viewership in order to renew the series for a fourth season. The hashtag #RenewODAAT began trending on Twitter, but the rally of support wasn’t enough. In a statement on Thursday, Netflix’s chief content officer, Ted Sarandos, called the decision to cancel the multigenerational family comedy “difficult.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>In 1985, Michael J. Fox was one of the biggest stars in the world: “Back to the Future” and “Teen Wolf” occupied the top two spots at the box office, and “Family Ties,” the long-running sitcom on which he played Alex P. Keaton, was at its peak. “I wanted to be a rock star,” Fox told David Marchese in this week’s Talk interview. “That’s what I thought being famous was. But I wasn’t a rock star. I was kind of an idiot. I missed the point.” Six years later, Fox found out he had Parkinson’s disease, which he credits with getting him on track. Fox still acts occasionally — later roles include those on “Scrubs” and “Boston Legal” — but has dedicated his life to advocating a cure for Parkinson’s. Fox and Marchese talked about acting with Parkinson’s, taking the wrong roles and staying positive: “Until it’s not funny anymore, it is funny.”

He still believes in a cure for Parkinson’s.

His foundation, which has raised $800 million to combat the disease, has a working relationship with the government. (Still, Fox found himself upset when President Trump appeared to mock Serge Kovaleski, a reporter for The New York Times who has the joint condition arthrogryposis. But he didn’t feel the need to say anything in response: “People already know Trump is an [expletive].”) He’s still hopeful for a cure. In the interim, he’s optimistic about a new drug that acts like a rescue inhaler when people freeze, but knows that prophylactics are not a cure — but they’re better than nothing.

He worried about presenting a “false hope” about his diagnosis.

“I’d made peace with the disease but presumed others had that same relationship when they didn’t,” he told Marchese. But then his experience got worse: He found himself in a position where he couldn’t walk and had round-the-clock aides, and was unsure if he could still keep up his hopeful disposition. He’s working on a new book about wading through all this.

His response to the diagnosis was to make a number of comedic films: “For Love or Money,” “Life With Mikey” and “Greedy,” which were critical and commercial flops.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Matt Hildreth

Columbus, Ohio

The writer is the founder and chairman of RuralOrganizing.org.

Paul Krugman is correct that “reviving declining regions is really hard .” It is made more challenging when those regions, such as the rural Appalachia where I live, are not realistic about the past, and therefore cannot move to the future.

The population of my county peaked about 1950, then steadily declined, with the exception of a small upward blip in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the result of strip mining coal. The heyday of mineral extraction is over, and, as with many rural communities, we do not have quick access to Interstates and commercial air hubs, and so cannot attract any business, including agriculture, that relies on transportation.

We do not have the amenities that attract younger people, and few that are attractive to tourists. We cannot support our current population or attract new folks. We must be honest with ourselves.

A modern business enterprise simply cannot function today without fast, reliable broadband internet service. Cities have it. Rural America by and large does not, at least not without significant expense. If the countryside can be wired as effectively as the city is, then arbitrage in land values and labor costs will quickly improve things for us folks out here in the sticks.

It is in America’s economic interest to demonstrate the political will to begin to revitalize our rural communities, regardless of how difficult it may seem. Hopefully, we will not wait until the country’s economy is negatively affected by its failure to address the needs of its rural citizens. I agree with Brian Dobson of the Rural Policy Research Institute, who states that “metropolitan and rural America need each other .”

We certainly should not throw up our hands and say that “nobody knows how to reverse” the heartland’s decline. Mr. Krugman and I may not know how to reverse the devastating economic trends in rural communities, but if there were the political will among our elected officials, they would engage the economists, policy institutes, agriculture scholars, scientists and rural citizens and commit the needed resources and effort to make a difference.

Mr. Krugman mentioned the presidential candidates’ visits to rural Iowa and other states. Hopefully, they and others would acknowledge the economic decline in rural America as an American problem and speak to the needs of rural voters.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Two years ago, the Supreme Court reaffirmed that there existed a constitutional “imperative to purge racial prejudice from the administration of justice.”

In the case of the Mississippi death-row prisoner Curtis Flowers, which the justices heard on Wednesday, the court is once again poised to send a message that racism has no place in the courtroom — this time in the area of jury selection, which remains an especially urgent issue in capital cases.

Mr. Flowers has faced trial an astonishing six times for the 1996 murder of four people at a furniture store in Winona, Miss. — a crime that he has said all along he did not commit. At question in Flowers v. Mississippi is whether District Attorney Doug Evans, who tried Mr. Flowers all those times, unconstitutionally excluded a number of blacks from serving as jurors at the sixth trial. (Mr. Flowers is black.)

With all-white or nearly all-white juries that Mr. Evans helped put together, each of Mr. Flowers’s first three trials resulted in guilty verdicts and death sentences. Those convictions were later reversed by the Mississippi Supreme Court on the basis of repeated instances of prosecutorial mischief. Mr. Flowers’s fourth and fifth trials resulted in mistrials because the jurors, some of whom were black, could not agree on a guilty verdict. And the sixth trial — the one the Supreme Court examined on Wednesday — resulted in Mr. Flowers’s conviction, again with a nearly all-white jury.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>BANGKOK — Next to a row of luxury hotels in a bustling business district here in Bangkok, the art gallery Nova Contemporary occupies a former storage area at the base of a high-rise apartment building.

“There’s no gallery area per se in Bangkok, so this is fairly normal,” said Nova’s cheery owner, Sutima Sucharitakul, of the location of her sleek space. “Everything is fairly spread out.”

On view at Nova through Sunday is a conceptual exhibition called “The Uncertain,” featuring works by the Thai artist Jedsada Tangtrakulwong.

By design, the show changes depending on the weather: On sunny days, some of the works are not available to be seen, remaining hidden in various ways, and the response to that offbeat approach has been mixed. Some visitors have been angered and have shared their feelings emphatically with Ms. Sucharitakul and her staff.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>FRIDAY PUZZLE — Welcome to another First Pass Friday, where I show you the beginnings of my own solve for the express purpose of making you feel better about yourself.

The point of First Pass Friday is to show you how little a supposed “expert” gets on the first pass through the clues (or how much, if you are a “glass half full” kind of person). I won’t solve the whole thing here, but I will get you started, and I did eventually finish the puzzle.

My hope is that this will help take the pressure off you as a solver to be “perfect” — or even to find it easy at first. It’s not meant to be easy. If, as a beginner, you can get even a few entries in a Friday New York Times puzzle, you’re doing really well.

With practice, you can solve. Really.

The first thing I did was violate my own solving rule, which involves scanning the clue list for “gimmes” — things you definitely know — before writing any entries in. I started at 1A in this very crunchy puzzle by David Steinberg, and the crossword gods punished me for it. I got the answer wrong.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>INDIANAPOLIS — First it was Kyler Murray’s height. Then it was Kyler Murray’s weight. And then, after Kyler Murray’s weight, it was Kyler Murray’s hand size.

By Friday, when Murray appeared before the news media, the chatter at the weeklong N.F.L. combine — an annual predraft meat market that makes little pretense of being anything subtler — had been dominated by discussions of his physical qualifications (or lack thereof). Does he, the Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback for Oklahoma who is preparing for April’s draft, really have what is needed to succeed as a pro?

Gil Brandt, the former Dallas Cowboys personnel chief, could not remember more buzz around a draft prospect.

“This is the most in history,” Brandt said, “and I’ve been doing this since 1977.”

A number of factors have contributed to the Kyler craze.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>When we wrote the special counsel regulations, we weren’t writing them in a vacuum. We were writing them after many, many pages dumped on Congress in the Ken Starr report about Monica Lewinsky and Whitewater. And that, I think, should concern all Americans, that you have a prosecutor really, I think, impinging on some of the most sensitive privacy concerns that human beings have. And so the requirements in the special counsel regulations are not written the way they were in the Independent Counsel Act, to provide every piece of information that was a concern. On the other side was also the need for public confidence. And so it’s going to depend on the case. In a case in which you’re dealing with private consenting activity among adults, you’re not going to really want to have the same level of detail as when you’re talking about, say, collusion with Russia.

The special counsel regulations actually require the attorney general report to go not just to the majority in Congress, but also to the minority party. Here it doesn’t matter, because there is now a Democratic or cross-party House of Representatives. But had this happened a year ago or six months ago, we wouldn’t have been able to say that. So that’s step one. Step two is — in the special counsel regulations is a provision for public disclosure of the report not just to Congress, but to the American people. So in part nine of the regulations, it says the attorney general is to make a determination that the public interest would be served by public release of the documents. Now it’s clear to say there are applicable legal restrictions. So grand jury information can’t ordinarily be released to the public. But that’s the way it would work, is the attorney general would review the report that he’s written and say, yeah, I think this should be made public, or maybe there’ll be some redactions and then be made public.

There would then be two possible big buckets of reasons why that decision could be made. One is the facts just weren’t there. Maybe they found that Trump didn’t have a corrupt intent. Maybe he wanted to do it for other reasons. Who knows? But the second bucket is what Bill Barr wrote in his 19-page memo to Trump when he was, some people say, campaigning for the job or whatever, which is to adopt a really pretty ridiculous legal theory, which was, the president can’t obstruct justice when he fires a cabinet official because, after all, presidents can fire cabinet officials for any reason. That’s generally right, but you can’t have a kind of corrupt motive. It’s just like, I have a laptop, and I can throw it into the river or set it on fire if I want, no problem. I have the right to do that. But if I know the F.B.I. is coming and looking for the laptop, and they have a warrant, I can’t go do those things. So same thing, the president can fire a cabinet-rank official generally, but he can’t do it in order to obstruct justice. And so if the Barr memo didn’t explain why to Congress he wasn’t pursuing a prosecution, then absolutely, that would be something in which it would raise every investigator’s hackles, and we’d have to get to the bottom of it. Let me give you another example. Suppose that Barr says, I’m not indicting the president for collusion with Russia. Doesn’t explain why. Again, there’s two possible reasons. One is, the facts aren’t there. The other is, under some of these old Justice Department opinions, a sitting president can’t be indicted. If Barr doesn’t tell us which, absolutely Congress and perhaps other investigators need to subpoena the documents to find out what actually happened here.

You’re absolutely right to say as the investigation morphs into a variety of different nodes, you can’t guarantee that same level of stature of independence, of nonpartisanship. And things do become more political. But at the end of the day, I do think our founders really had it right — that sometimes, when you have overlapping jurisdiction, federal and state, and overlapping branches of government between congressional investigations and executive branch investigations, you actually do get at the right answer in the end, for reasons that James Madison said in Federalist 51: that people aren’t angels. And so if you can create overlapping investigative checks and balances, that it’s going to be cumbersome, it’s going to be frustrating, it’s going to be slow. But it is the way that we get truth in our system.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Just days after saying that it would close most of its stores, Tesla is making an abrupt U-turn.

In a message posted on its blog just before midnight Sunday, the electric-car maker said it had decided to retain many of the locations it had shut down or was planning to close. And it said it would raise most of its vehicle prices about 3 percent worldwide, just weeks after cutting prices.

“Over the past two weeks we have been closely evaluating every single Tesla retail location, and we have decided to keep significantly more stores open than previously announced as we continue to evaluate them over the course of several months,” the company said in the blog post. The price increases, it said, are necessary to make up for the loss of savings that was anticipated from the store closings.

The flip-flops are the latest sign of turmoil surrounding the company and its chief executive, Elon Musk.

“This reversal is bizarre and indicates a lack of actual planning in the earlier announcement,” said Mike Ramsey, a Gartner analyst. “Their retail stores still serve a real need.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>2) And yet Trump is a weak president.

As nervous as congressional Republicans may be about primary challenges, they also keep showing that their support of Trump is almost purely self-interested — and not very deep.

Even with the hypocritical support, 12 Republicans voted against Trump’s declaration, allowing the measure to pass 59-41 and presumably forcing him to issue a humiliating veto. The vote, The Times editorial board writes, “is a big deal. In practical terms, it could fortify the multiple lawsuits pending against Mr. Trump’s absurd declaration, a faux emergency so nakedly political that even he admitted it was unnecessary.”

Not long before the Senate vote, the House yesterday passed a resolution — in a 420-to-0 shutout — demanding that the Justice Department release the Mueller report.

The combination of the two votes was a remarkable rebuke. Yes, congressional Republicans are doing far less than they should to stand up to Trump. Many of them, like Tillis, have made themselves look foolish in the process. But it’s also the case that Trump receives less support from his own party than any other president in recent history.

His presidency, as Bloomberg’s Bernstein has written, is entering “a dangerous phase” for him.

      <TEXT>PARIS — Is the concept store over as a, well, concept?

“What is a concept store? Personally, I don’t know any,” said Arthur Gerbi, the president of Merci, a multibrand, multicategory store founded in 2009 and labeled by everyone, back in the era of the now-closed Colette, as Paris’s “other” concept store. “To me, a store is a reflection of the people who work there. I believe in the edit, the eye, the curation.”

It may sound like semantics, but as its 10th anniversary nears, Merci is focused on redefining what, exactly, is the retail experience. This month, it is doing a slow reveal of an annex called, simply, “the apartment.” It’s not so much a place for commerce as a way of being: It will be about “discovery, sharing, pleasure,” Mr. Gerbi said.

It has been germinating for a decade, and took the past two years to blossom.

Ever since its successful pop-up experiment in a house in Montmartre in 2017 (a partnership with the lifestyle website My Little Paris), the Merci team had been thinking about a way to expand its own lifestyle philosophy.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Attorney General William P. Barr told congressional leaders in a letter late Friday that the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has concluded his inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election and delivered a report to the Department of Justice.

See the letter here and read a transcript below.

[What’s next? We break it down as well as the major moments in the case. And here’s the latest analysis on Trump and the Mueller report.]

I write to notify you pursuant to 28 C.F.R. § 600.9(a)(3) that Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III has concluded his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and related matters. In addition to this notification, the Special Counsel regulations require that I provide you with “a description and explanation of instances (if any) in which the Attorney General” or acting Attorney General “concluded that a proposed action by a Special Counsel was so inappropriate or unwarranted under established Departmental practices that it should not be pursued.” 28 C.F.R. § 600.9(a)(3). There were no such instances during the Special Counsel’s investigation.

The Special Counsel has submitted to me today a “confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions” he has reached, as required by 28 C.F.R. § 600.8(c). I am reviewing the report and anticipate that I may be in a position to advise you of the Special Counsel’s principal conclusions as soon as this weekend.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>At the same time, there are real safety concerns to address before we can implement end-to-end encryption across all of our messaging services. Encryption is a powerful tool for privacy, but that includes the privacy of people doing bad things. When billions of people use a service to connect, some of them are going to misuse it for truly terrible things like child exploitation, terrorism, and extortion. We have a responsibility to work with law enforcement and to help prevent these wherever we can. We are working to improve our ability to identify and stop bad actors across our apps by detecting patterns of activity or through other means, even when we can’t see the content of the messages, and we will continue to invest in this work. But we face an inherent tradeoff because we will never find all of the potential harm we do today when our security systems can see the messages themselves.

Finding the right ways to protect both privacy and safety is something societies have historically grappled with. There are still many open questions here and we’ll consult with safety experts, law enforcement and governments on the best ways to implement safety measures. We’ll also need to work together with other platforms to make sure that as an industry we get this right. The more we can create a common approach, the better.

On balance, I believe working towards implementing end-to-end encryption for all private communications is the right thing to do. Messages and calls are some of the most sensitive private conversations people have, and in a world of increasing cyber security threats and heavy-handed government intervention in many countries, people want us to take the extra step to secure their most private data. That seems right to me, as long as we take the time to build the appropriate safety systems that stop bad actors as much as we possibly can within the limits of an encrypted service. We’ve started working on these safety systems building on the work we’ve done in WhatsApp, and we’ll discuss them with experts through 2019 and beyond before fully implementing end-to-end encryption. As we learn more from those experts, we’ll finalize how to roll out these systems.

We increasingly believe it’s important to keep information around for shorter periods of time. People want to know that what they share won’t come back to hurt them later, and reducing the length of time their information is stored and accessible will help.

One challenge in building social tools is the “permanence problem”. As we build up large collections of messages and photos over time, they can become a liability as well as an asset. For example, many people who have been on Facebook for a long time have photos from when they were younger that could be embarrassing. But people also really love keeping a record of their lives. And if all posts on Facebook and Instagram disappeared, people would lose access to a lot of valuable knowledge and experiences others have shared.

I believe there’s an opportunity to set a new standard for private communication platforms — where content automatically expires or is archived over time. Stories already expire after 24 hours unless you archive them, and that gives people the comfort to share more naturally. This philosophy could be extended to all private content.

For example, messages could be deleted after a month or a year by default. This would reduce the risk of your messages resurfacing and embarrassing you later. Of course you’d have the ability to change the timeframe or turn off auto-deletion for your threads if you wanted. And we could also provide an option for you to set individual messages to expire after a few seconds or minutes if you wanted.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WASHINGTON — A dozen Republicans joined Senate Democrats on Thursday to overturn President Trump’s declaration of a national emergency at the southwestern border, arguing that the president had exceeded his powers in trying to build a border wall over Congress’s objections.

The 59-to-41 vote on a measure already approved by the House set up the first veto of Mr. Trump’s presidency. It was not a big enough margin to override his promised veto, but Congress has now voted for the first time to block a presidential emergency declaration — and on one of the core promises that animated Mr. Trump’s political rise.

“Never before has a president asked for funding, Congress has not provided it, and the president then has used the National Emergencies Act of 1976 to spend the money anyway,” said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee. “Our nation’s founders gave to Congress the power to approve all spending so that the president would not have too much power. This check on the executive is a crucial source of our freedom.”

It was the latest sign that the cautious Republican majority in the Senate, spurred on by a far bolder Democrat-controlled House, was beginning to reassert its authority with a president who had gone virtually unchecked during his first two years in office.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>If the Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker runs a successful campaign through 2020, he could enter the White House as one of only a few presidents who were not married when they took office.

And so, in addition to the more typical questions about his candidacy — What are his odds in one of the most crowded and diverse Democratic primaries in American history? Could his candidacy be hurt by past connections to Wall Street and Silicon Valley? — people have also been wondering:

Is he dating anyone?

Mr. Booker, 49, who has talked about how his mother was pestering him to get married, has tended to be tight-lipped. But last month, he opened up a little bit more.

“I’m dating somebody really special,” he said during a radio appearance. “I got a boo.”

On Thursday, Rosario Dawson, the actress and political activist who supported Bernie Sanders during the 2016 presidential campaign, confirmed widespread speculation that it was she who was dating Mr. Booker, according to a video posted by TMZ.

“I am just grateful to be with someone that I respect and love and admire so much,” Ms. Dawson, 39, said in the video, batting away a question about the possibility of a future engagement.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>A spokesman for the Metropolitan Opera, which has received at least $1 million from the Raymond and Beverly Sackler Fund for the Arts &amp; Sciences, said “there are no significant contributions currently being made to the Metropolitan Opera by any members of the Sackler family or their foundations.”

The Dia Art Foundation and the American Museum of Natural History, which together have received millions from foundations tied to Raymond’s brother Mortimer Sackler, did not respond to requests for comment. (The third brother who founded the company, Arthur Sackler, died before OxyContin was created and his share was bought out by his brothers, a point often raised by museums that have received money from Arthur or his heirs.)

The Guggenheim’s move was perhaps the most surprising, and not just because it was the first American institution known to cut ties with its Sackler supporters.

Mortimer D.A. Sackler, a son of Mortimer Sackler, sat on the Guggenheim’s board for nearly 20 years and the family gave the museum $9 million between 1995 and 2015, including $7 million to establish and support the Sackler Center for Arts Education.

The Guggenheim and the Metropolitan Museum had been the scene of protests related to the Sacklers. One last month, led by the photographer Nan Goldin, who overcame an OxyContin addiction, involved dropping thousands of slips of white paper from the iconic gallery spiral into its rotunda, a reference to a court document that quoted Richard Sackler, who ran Purdue Pharma, heralding a “blizzard of prescriptions that will bury the competition.”

Last Thursday, the Guggenheim, like other American museums, stated simply that “no contributions from the Sackler family have been received since 2015 and no additional gifts are planned.”

But a day later, amid more articles about British museums rejecting Sackler money, the Guggenheim amended its statement: “The Guggenheim does not plan to accept any gifts.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>JERUSALEM — By turns angry and choked up, sneering and defiant, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a lengthy, emotional response Thursday night to the decision by Israel’s attorney general to indict him on bribery and other corruption charges.

He spoke on national television in prime time, his voice breaking when he alluded to the trial of his wife, Sara, on charges that she misused about $100,000 of state funds, and to their son Yair, a right-wing provocateur on social media. They were also investigated, but the attorney general said neither would be charged.

Here are excerpts from Mr. Netanyahu’s remarks, and what we think he meant by them.

TEXT “Citizens of Israel, last night I met in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin. I made it clear to him that we would continue to act with all our might against Iran’s attempts to entrench itself militarily in Syria. I thank my friend, President Putin, who accepted my remarks. When I returned to Israel I heard this morning the words of support for me by U.S. President Donald Trump. He praised, and I quote, my strong, intelligent and resolute leadership of the State of Israel. I thank my friend, President Trump, for his remarks …. That unique relationship with the leaders of the world powers isn’t a trifling matter. It isn’t self-evident. I’ve been building it for many years, and it has helped me ensure our security and our future. It’s helped me safeguard our country.”

SUBTEXT The presidents of the United States and Russia are my friends, and no one running against me can say that. It’s taken me years to build those relationships. Don’t throw them away. I am keeping you safe.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Now, it’s clear many in the media have gone bananas for Mr. Buttigieg. That’s not surprising: We love a fresh new face, particularly if it’s historic (first openly gay president?) and kind of quirky (ask him about “Finnegans Wake”; or, on second thought, maybe don’t.)

But are real humans — you know, the kind that actually vote — feeling that same tingle? There’s some evidence that they are: Google searches are up. He brought in more than $600,000 in donations after a televised town hall event on CNN earlier this month, enough to qualify for the debate stage. And a new poll out today from Quinnipiac University has him at a whopping 4 percent, even with Senator Elizabeth Warren and far above his previous national standing of 1 percent.

Of course, polyglot or not, Mr. Buttigieg remains a very untested quantity on the national stage. His most significant national political experience was a failed bid for the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee. He has tackled crime, economic blight and congestion as mayor of South Bend, but the city has a population of just over 100,000 — hardly like leading New York or Los Angeles.

Mr. Buttigieg’s lack of a political past may be an asset, though, since he has no record of roll call votes, no history of stances on controversial issues. Just ask Joe Biden, who found himself facing backlash this week after musing that he wished he could have “done something” about the way the Senate Judiciary Committee treated Anita Hill in 1991. (Mr. Biden was the chairman of that committee at the time.)

What this whole Buttigieg moment tells me is that we may be into a campaign much like the Republican race in 2012: Remember Herman Cain? Or Tim Pawlenty? Both those men caught a spark, if not quite fire, during that long primary slog.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“Many of these people need multiple surgeries due to the complex nature of their injuries, and the need to provide a number of shorter surgeries in a phased way so patients have the best chance of recovery,” he said.

Air New Zealand announces name of victim

The airline Air New Zealand said one of its employees, Lilik Abdul Hamid, was among those killed.

The company’s chief executive, Christopher Luxon, said in a statement that Mr. Hamid had been an aircraft maintenance engineer with Air New Zealand for 16 years.

“He first got to know the team even earlier when he worked with our aircraft engineers in a previous role overseas,” Mr. Luxon said. “The friendships he made at that time led him to apply for a role in Air New Zealand and make the move to Christchurch.”

Mr. Hamid is survived by his wife and two children, Mr. Luxon said.

It was the first public announcement of one of the victim’s names. The police have yet to release a list of those who died.

Little information on other victims as death toll rises

The police said on Sunday that the death toll had risen to 50 as officials discovered another body at the mosque on Deans Avenue, where most of the victims were killed. Another 50 people were injured.

“As of last night we were able to take all of the victims from both of those scenes and in doing so we have located a further victim,” said Mike Bush, New Zealand’s police commissioner.

Mr. Bush said a list of victims’ names has been compiled with the help of senior religious leaders and had been shared with family members. He said the list was an informal one, though, and that officials would not confirm the names publicly until the bodies had been formally identified.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Pi is defined as the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter, something the internet reminds us of every March 14 (or 3.14). But the famous mathematical ratio, estimated to more than 22 trillion digits (and counting), is the perfect symbol for our species’ long effort to tame infinity, one mathematician, Steven Strogatz, writes.

“For some people, Pi Day is an occasion to marvel at circles, long revered as symbols of perfection, reincarnation and the cycles of nature,” writes Mr. Strogatz. “But it is the domestication of infinity that we really should be celebrating.” Above, the Children’s Museum of Houston’s celebration for Pi Day in 2011.

      <TEXT>Manager Gil Hodges at first was in the mob outside. The first one into the empty office was Gil Jr., the C.W. Post College student, who hastily climbed out of his civilian clothes and into his Met uniform for the sweaty hour to follow.

Then came his mother, and the older two of his three sisters.

“We’re champions,” cried out Joan Hodges, who has lived through her husband’s baseball triumphs and setbacks with such fervor all these years. “Imagine, we did it!”

A moment later, the head of the family entered, and Joan hugged him and squealed:

“You know what we are? You know? Champions. We’re champions of the world.”

Hodges hugged her back, and his daughters. And they kissed him, and he grinned, and Gil Jr. put his arms around them from behind while the Mets photographer snapped a family portrait.

And then the stream of interviewers began to trickle in, filling the office with bodies but not with any of the hysteria outside. Hodges, as he has always been, was calm, speaking softly but distinctly, mopping his face, listening attentively, answering carefully, smiling quickly — working, in a way, harder than during the game.

“Oh my, oh my,” she kept repeating. “Oh my.” Donald Grant, the chairman of the board, was there, and then Johnny Murphy, who actually ran the club as general manager, and Georgie Weiss who had started it, and other members of the Mets family.

“Yes, it’s the same and it’s different,” said Hodges, trying to answer questions about how this victory felt alongside other World Series triumphs he experienced with the Dodgers, in 1955 and 1959. “As a player, and as a manager, it’s different — it’s hard to explain. In a way this means more. I’m so proud of them all.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>A rancorous fight between John Schnatter, the former chairman of the Papa John’s pizza chain, and the company he founded appears to have been resolved, with Mr. Schnatter agreeing to give up his board seat after he helps choose an acceptable successor.

In a settlement laid out in a securities filing on Tuesday, Mr. Schnatter and the company moved toward ending the dispute, which has simmered since his acrimonious departure in July as the leader of one of the world’s largest pizza delivery chains.

Mr. Schnatter exited after a report that he had used a racial slur in a comment about black people, a statement he subsequently said in court had been mischaracterized and was actually “anti-racist.”

The company, which Mr. Schnatter started about 35 years ago, quickly scrubbed his ubiquitous image from marketing and other corporate materials and evicted him from Papa John’s headquarters in Louisville, Ky.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>In early April, Ms. Fogel sent Mr. Fisher “names of places he should go and questions he should ask regarding information on Alzheimer’s related to his mom,” she said.

She also extended an invitation to Mr. Fisher and his father to one of her company’s conferences, which was to take place in Philadelphia the following month.

Mr. Fisher, then living in Newington, Conn., went (his father could not attend). Afterward he and Ms. Fogel chatted over a few drinks.

“It was the best date, nondate I ever had,” Ms. Fogel said. “We talked about his mom and then transitioned to talking about pretty much everything else for three hours.”

They kept in touch and met for what turned out to be a sort-of-first-date in June at a Manhattan restaurant, where Ms. Fogel had several friends in tow. On July 1, he met her family at their home in Narragansett, R.I., before they went to Newport, R.I., to spend the day together.

“I think we both felt something differently going on between us that day,” Mr. Fisher said. “In addition to our connection to this disease, we started to get to know each other a little more and began realizing we had so many other things in common, and what struck me most about being in her company was the ease in which we spoke and got along.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The show begins with Fleabag being interviewed for a clerical job, and it establishes her contradictory approach to others, including the audience, equally ingratiating and antagonistic. The interviewer is a man, who it emerges has recently been accused of sexual harassment.

“That won’t get you very far here anymore,” we hear his recorded voice saying to Fleabag, when she starts to remove her sweater, revealing she has only a bra on underneath.

Fleabag swears this flashing of flesh was inadvertent. Then again, pretty much everything she does is an act of self-sabotage, even when it’s in the name of self-gratification. “I’m not obsessed with sex,” she says. “I just can’t stop thinking about it. The performance of it. The awkwardness of it. The drama of it.”

She masturbates a lot, inspired by online images of everyone from Zac Efron to Barack Obama, “especially when I’m bored or angry or upset. Or happy.” And she registers all possible flickers of desire in the eyes of the men she sees, on the streets, in the subway, in her cafe.

In most best-selling confessional memoirs, such hypersexuality would be traced to a primal woundedness — preferably caused by a single traumatic incident or abusive relationship — and (or) a misogynistic society. Ms. Waller-Bridge doesn’t traffic in clear-cut causes and effects.

Yes, the script includes a late revelation about a life-wrenching act of betrayal. But Fleabag seems to have been behaving in much the same manner long before that act occurred. And yes, the show takes place against an internet-shaped landscape of vast and mutable carnality. (Listen to her listing the varied names of the porn sites she visits.)

But while Fleabag is very much a woman of her time and place, a self-described “bad feminist” who exploits and is exploited by what surrounds her in the urban here and now, she can’t be entirely defined by them. Think of her as one of the great novelist Jean Rhys’s lost, promiscuous heroines transplanted to the 21st century, but with a devouring sense of humor that goes far beyond irony.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>It’s hard to find something Anna Konkle and Maya Erskine don’t know about each other.

The 31-year-olds met as undergraduates studying experimental theater at New York University, and in the decade or so since, they’ve caught each other up on most of their teenage experiences. In a “crazy experiment,” as Erskine described it, they took this openness and made it the core of their first TV show: “Pen15.”

“The show is our stories and our secrets,” Erskine said.

Set in a middle school in 2000, the Hulu comedy has the pair playing lightly fictionalized versions of themselves in seventh grade, surrounded by actual 13-year-old actors. Watching the show feels remarkably intimate, like reading a teenager’s very funny diary. In 10 half-hour episodes, we see Anna and Maya discover masturbation, thongs and second base. Maya gets her period for the first time, and Anna survives a terrible first kiss. The show has bullying and divorce and racism.

Six years ago, when Erskine and Konkle started working on the series (which they created with Sam Zvibleman), the only depiction of middle school that seemed to accurately portray their experiences was Todd Solondz’s 1995 film “Welcome to the Dollhouse.” (Today a list of raw middle school offerings could also include Bo Burnham’s “Eighth Grade” and “Big Mouth” on Netflix.)</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Much has been said about the commodification of women in the workplace, especially the service industry, but gauging its emotional toil is often an elusive undertaking. This brisk and biting poem reads like a witness statement — the case against the manager mounts with each “helpful” tip. What’s especially disturbing is how comfortable he feels dispensing his advice, unwittingly confirming that the chauvinist power structure remains in place, even as his own words turn against him. Lauren K. Alleyne has written a fitting poetic indictment of a man who is hoisted, to quote Hamlet, “with his own petard.” Selected by Rita Dove

The Manager’s Tips for Working at the San Francisco Restaurant and Bar

He said to my breasts: you’re hired.

He said: you’re going to be in training for six weeks

and I don’t pay trainees. You work for tips.

He said: I’d show off my assets more

if I were you. He said, I’d turn on that million-dollar smile

no matter what kind of day you’re having.

He said, men drink more if they think you’re really listening

to them: lean in. Especially in the right dress. He said,

go on, Hector wants to dance with you. He said,

loosen up. He said, nobody likes a stuck up bartender.

He said, if anyone asks, it’s always best to be nineteen.

He said, if someone wants to buy you a drink, let them.

He said, watch Ruthie work, she knows the ropes —

look at her swing. (Her red hair crawls with a drunk man’s fingers.)

He said: Honey, I’ll give you a tip for free;

how this goes is entirely up to you.

      <TEXT>CHARLOTTE HORTON FIRST learned of Castello di Potentino, the dilapidated fortress that is now her world, from a guidebook more than two decades ago. Perched on a promontory jutting from the face of Mount Amiata, a volcanic peak in southern Tuscany with a purplish-blue cast, the 20-bedroom castle, thought to have been built on Etruscan foundations dating to the fourth century B.C., was all that remained of an 11th-century bulwark with medieval walls encircling a central stone-paved courtyard. Such a mythic site was a siren song to Horton and her family members, a bohemian tribe reminiscent of the British expatriates in Italy gently teased by E.M. Forster in “A Room With a View”: intrepid, culturally voracious and joyously out of bounds.

So one summer day, she and her half brother, Alexander Greene, now 40, joined their mother, Sally, a former ballerina and photographer, and Horton’s stepfather, Graham C. Greene, a Guinness heir and nephew of the novelist, who was once the managing director of the publishing house Jonathan Cape and chairman of the British Museum, to explore what remained of the fabled house. The untrammeled corner of southern Tuscany was not unfamiliar to them, nor was exploring a bedraggled historic estate. Although their main residence was in London, where Horton, 55, had started out as an editorial assistant at Vogue, developing a personal style that fused punk with flamboyant neo-Romanticism (an Yves Saint Laurent bomber jacket atop a cut-silk velvet 1930s evening gown, for example), the Greenes had, in 1989, bought Montepò, an imposing ramshackle castle on a thousand-acre estate 35 miles away, which they transformed into a thriving winery (they sold it to a scion of the Biondi Santi family, creators of Brunello wines, in 1999). Still, Mount Amiata had nothing of the well-groomed prettiness that tourists associate with the region. Wild and rugged, the terrain is thick with chestnut trees and juniper; in the winter, there are blistering snowstorms; in August, the sun can scorch.

      <TEXT>BRATISLAVA, Slovakia — A few months before his murder, Jan Kuciak received a disturbing phone call from one of Slovakia’s most prominent businessmen. Mr. Kuciak had written more than a dozen articles about the businessman, Marian Kocner, outlining a pattern of corrupt dealings made possible by his connections with the police and prosecutors. Mr. Kocner, long thought to have ties to organized crime, was furious.

“You can be sure that I will start paying special attention to you personally, Mr. Kuciak,” Mr. Kocner told the 27-year-old investigative reporter in September 2017.

Mr. Kuciak reported the threat to the police but, after more than a month, he wrote on Facebook that officers had yet to pick up the case. When they did, they dismissed it without even interviewing Mr. Kocner, according to the authorities.

In February 2018, Mr. Kuciak, 27, was shot dead in his home. His 27-year-old fiancée, Martina Kusnirova, was also killed there.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Q. Are dung beetles ever employed as a natural way to handle animal feces?

A. The thousands of species of voracious beetles in the family Scarabaeoidea evolved to move, bury and consume the excrement of many animals in nature.

Dung beetles are widely recognized as important contributors to farm cleanups, as well. Some species have been transplanted into alien environments to help meet agricultural needs.

From the 1960s to the 1980s, there was a large-scale introduction of dung beetles into Australia to handle the excrement of another introduced species, beef cattle. Government entomologists imported dozens of species of beetles to address several problems, among them fouled pastures, slowing decomposition and disease-carrying flies in ordure.

Depending on soil types and other environmental factors, some species became established over the long term. Dung beetles have also been found to improve soil conditions, to suppress E. coli in blueberry fields, and to feed on harmful fly larvae in pastures.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Few regions are as important to understanding contemporary trends in wine as Burgundy, not only in France but throughout the world.

That’s a problem, because Burgundy is relatively scarce and fairly expensive. Nonetheless, it’s important to understand the history of Burgundy, as well as the thought that goes into making the wine.

Rather than studying its most famous regions, our approach at Wine School has been to snoop around the less-exalted edges, where the prices are a bit less daunting. Among the whites, we have looked at Chablis and aligoté, while among the reds we have examined Marsannay.

Now it’s time to return to another peripheral area to Burgundy, the Côte Chalonnaise, a large area just south of the Côte d’Or, Burgundy’s most celebrated region.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Upset Alert: No. 1 Virginia in Big Trouble Vs. Gardner-Webb

Could it really be happening again? A year ago, Virginia became the first No. 1 men’s seed to lose in the first round when it fell to Maryland-Baltimore County. This year, Virginia a No. 1 seed again and it is trailing again, this time to No. 16 Gardner Webb. The Runnin’ Bulldogs took a 26-14 lead with 7:40 left to play in the first half, and are playing with a lot of confidence.

But who are they, and where do they come from?

Gardner-Webb, which is in the N.C.A.A. tournament for the first time, is located 128 miles from Columbia, S.C., where Friday’s game is being played. It is just over the border in North Carolina, so the stands are packed with fans in red and black, and they are loving it. The Bulldogs have a swarming defense and they are feeding off the fan support. Gardner-Webb made 13 of its first 22 shots.

If the Cavaliers were not tight coming into the game, they look it now.

Third-seeded Texas Tech shook off a slow first half to roll past 14th-seeded Northern Kentucky in the West Region. Jarrett Culver, the Big 12 Player of the Year, scored 29 points on 10-for-17 shooting. The Red Raiders shot 53 percent from the field over all.

In one of the biggest first-round victories by a No. 9 seed in N.C.A.A. tournament history, Oklahoma blitzed No. 8 Mississippi, 95-72, in the South Region. Paced by four starters who scored at least 18 points, the Sooners raced to a 12-0 lead, went up by 17 at halftime and led by as many as 29 in the second half. Christian James and Rashard Odomes each had 20 points for Oklahoma. Terence Davis had 17 for the Rebels.

According to David Worlock, the N.C.A.A.’s director of media coordination/statistics, the Sooners’ 23-point margin of victory equaled Mississippi State’s over Stanford in 2005 and trailed only Purdue’s 24, over L.S.U in 2003, and Pittsburgh’s 29, over Colorado in 2014. Next up for Oklahoma is a with No. 1 Virginia, which beat No. 16 Gardner-Webb.

Brace Yourselves: There Have Been Two Buzzer-Beaters Today

Sure, both were to end the first half. But UC-Irvine and Kansas State are tied at halftime, 30-30, after this Max Hazzard 3-pointer:</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Six new paperbacks to check out this week.

HEAVY: An American Memoir, by Kiese Laymon. (Scribner, $16.) Laymon’s profound memoir reflects on his childhood in Jackson, Miss., and shows how his pursuit of excellence was a means to survive. Touching on everything from the racism he encountered to the physical and sexual abuse he endured, Laymon compares his childhood memories with how he feels in middle age, and offers a complex, nuanced portrayal of his mother.

CONFESSIONS OF THE FOX, by Jordy Rosenberg. (One World, $17.) Rosenberg’s novel is a heady romp through an 18th-century England awash in sex, crime and revolutionary ideas. When Dr. Voth, the principal narrator, finds a mysterious manuscript at a book sale, the novel expands to tell the story of Jack Sheppard and Bess Khan, notorious thieves and jailbreakers in London, and their high jinks.

FLY GIRLS: How Five Daring Women Defied All Odds and Made Aviation History, by Keith O’Brien. (Mariner, $15.99.) Amelia Earhart wasn’t the only female pilot to take to the skies in the 1920s, this lively new account shows, but many have been overlooked. In addition to Earhart, the book focuses on Ruth Nichols, Louise Thaden, Ruth Elder and Florence Klingensmith. As O’Brien puts it, “Each of the women went missing in her own way.”

DO THIS FOR ME, by Eliza Kennedy. (Broadway, $16.) Raney Moore thought she had the perfect life. A lawyer at a top-flight Manhattan law firm, she is the mother of charming teenagers and happily married. But when she discovers her husband is having an affair, she torches their life together — canceling his credit cards, deleting his email account and shipping his belongings to his mother’s house — and must determine the future she wants for herself. It’s an exhilarating, if over-the-top, novel of divorce.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Overlooked is a series of obituaries about remarkable people whose deaths, beginning in 1851, went unreported in The Times.

It was hardly the first affront. They had grown up in a segregated Alaska: separate schools, hospitals, theaters, restaurants and cemeteries. But for Elizabeth Peratrovich and her husband, Roy, Tlingit natives, the sign they spotted one day in late 1941 in Douglas, just across the channel from downtown Juneau, was the final straw.

“The proprietor of Douglas Inn does not seem to realize that our Native boys are just as willing as the white boys to lay down their lives to protect the freedom that he enjoys,” they wrote in a letter to Ernest Gruening, the territory’s governor, signaling the start of their campaign to fight discrimination in Alaska.

Calling such open bias “an outrage,” the couple continued, “We will still be here to guard our beloved country while hordes of uninterested whites will be fleeing South.”

Gruening agreed with the Peratroviches, and they joined forces. In 1943, they attempted to usher an antidiscrimination bill through Alaska’s two-branch Territorial Legislature. It failed, with a tie vote of 8-8 in the House.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Festering becomes a highly dramatic — and kinetic — art when it’s Isabelle Huppert who’s stewing. This most enduringly fearless of French film stars has taken on the title role of Florian Zeller’s “The Mother,” a woman for whom the empty nest is a toxic dump.

Her name is Anne, and she’ll be waiting for you, radiating waves of poisonous discontent, when you enter the Linda Gross Theater, where this compact, very French Freudian chamber work opened on Monday night in an Atlantic Theater Company production. There she is — chicly swathed in a gray turtleneck and black skirt, as slender and sharp as a knife blade — holding a matching, slim book that you know she’s not really reading.

The sofa she’s sitting on stretches the length of the stage, suggesting an unending series of days alone with a book, a drink, and rankling thoughts that grow louder and louder. She is waiting, waiting — like some Gallic Lady of Shalott — to be released from her captivity by the arrival of the man she loves most. That would be her 25-year-old son.

Throughout her long and celebrated film career, Ms. Huppert has shown a breathtaking willingness to travel to the outer limits of emotional extremes. Witness her Oscar-nominated performance as the vengeful rape victim in the Paul Verhoeven thriller “Elle.” Or her turn as a stalker with seriously skewed maternal instincts in the current “Greta.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>This week, internet security researchers woke up to disturbing news. An attacker had installed malware on as many as half a million Asus-brand computers running the Windows operating system. Reports of large-scale malware infections have become almost routine, but what made this one notable was how it was accomplished: the attacker compromised the Asus servers used to send periodic operating system and security updates to customers. In other words, as far as the customer could tell, the malicious software came directly from the manufacturer, complete with its digital stamp of approval.

Subverting a software update system (a type of “supply chain attack” in security parlance) is usually associated with international espionage and intelligence operations — not with run-of-the-mill attempts to steal credit card numbers or banking passwords — and for good reason. It requires considerable resources and skill because the hardware and software companies’ systems that have to be compromised are generally better managed and more carefully secured than those of individual consumers. But when they are successful, attacks against the supply chain are an especially powerful threat: They rely not on repeatedly fooling each user into, say, opening the wrong email attachment (a common way malware is spread), but on the trust that users naturally and reasonably place in the suppliers that sold them their hardware and software. It’s a dangerously effective way for the attacker to reach many thousands of victims (or a few carefully selected targets).

Fortunately, while the Asus attack exploited the vendor update mechanism to install unauthorized software on many thousands of computers, it appears that the malware itself was designed to affect only a few hundred actual targets and was relatively harmless to everyone else. But that still leaves us with the uncomfortable fact that a software update mechanism — a critical system intended to protect users — was turned on its head and used to attack them instead. And it’s not just Asus; almost every other major software and hardware vendor offers an update mechanism for its products, sometimes enabled by default.

To protect against the insidious threat of malicious updates, it might be tempting to immediately disable these mechanisms on your computers and smartphones. But that would be a terrible idea, one that would expose you to far more harm than it would protect against. In fact, now would be a fine time to check your devices and make sure the automatic system update features are turned on and running.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt star as TV western veteran Rick Dalton and his stunt double, Cliff Booth, and the trailer suggests some professional tension between them. (Cliff seems to bristle at the suggestion that his job is to “help carry the load” for Rick.) Margot Robbie plays Dalton’s next-door neighbor, Sharon Tate, and the story’s 1969 setting means she’s not long for this world; the actress was slain by Charles Manson’s followers that summer.

While we get a glimpse of Manson (Damon Herriman), the clip has a surprisingly upbeat tone, as Dalton dances on the groovy TV series “Hullabaloo,” and Booth crosses paths with Bruce Lee (Mike Moh). Hippies and Playboy bunnies add to the period ambience, as does the 1967 tune “Bring a Little Lovin’” by Los Bravos.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Mr. Forsythe clearly loves ballet, and that love comes through. What’s more, the young Boston Ballet dancers connect to it. Chyrstyn Fentroy, who moved to the company from Dance Theater of Harlem in 2017, is newly radiant here. Secure in her gorgeous technique, she’s relaxed, charming, infectiously joyful — giving exactly what’s needed to make a pop ballet pop.

In the company hierarchy, Ms. Fentroy is a second soloist, and it’s to Mr. Forsythe’s credit that he has given her the spotlight and drawn her out. All through the ranks, he is making Boston Ballet look terrific, from the pristine exactitude of Derek Dunn and the sunny brilliance of Misa Kuranaga, both principals, to the eager verve of Daniel Durrett, a corps member.

That’s true even in “Pas/Parts 2018,” a reworking of a piece he created for Paris Opera Ballet in 1999. Here, the academicism is more dully academic, dense strings of steps with no story in them and little for the imagination to hold on to. The tired disruptions of Thom Willems’s electronic score and the flat-footed pseudo-casual walks meant to turn classroom exercises contemporary feel like worn-out catchphrases.

“Blake Works I,” made for Paris Opera Ballet in 2016, is fresher. Songs from James Blake’s album “The Colour in Anything” give the piece an integrity of tone and feeling, and the ballet steps fit, even if the melancholy tempts Mr. Forsythe into mushiness.

None of these pieces are going to change your life. And programmed in sequence, “Blake Works I” and “Playlist (EP)” exhibit a sameness. One made in Europe, one made here, both are works by an artist in a similar place, emotionally. On Thursday, when Mr. Forsythe came out to bow, he smiled sheepishly and had to be pushed forward. He looked not like a genius or a scourge but like a happy man.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>This week, a Georgia state representative, Ed Setzler, the sponsor of a bill that would ban most abortions as soon as a fetal heartbeat could be detected, spoke to a conservative group in the Atlanta suburbs about the legal fight he’d embarked on. “We need to maximize our influence over the next couple of weeks and then close this deal,” he said. Then, he continued, conservatives must mobilize behind Georgia’s Republican governor, Brian Kemp, as “he recruits the best legal team in the nation to take this to the highest court in the land.”

With the ascension of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, as well as a host of other judges appointed by Donald Trump to lower courts, anti-abortion forces are engaged in a game of legislative whack-a-mole. Sensing their chance to either eviscerate or overturn Roe v. Wade, Republicans are pushing a barrage of anti-abortion measures at the state level, seeing which one goes all the way to the top.

Access to abortion is already as polarized as anything else in this fracturing country, and it could become dramatically more so. Conservatives, as well as some moderates, have argued that ending Roe would ease culture-war hostilities. “Returning the matter to the states would give most people a law they can live with, defusing the rage that permeates politics and has more than once culminated in acts of terrorism against doctors who perform abortions,” wrote The Washington Post’s Megan McArdle last year. The early signs, however, suggest that radically different abortion regimes can’t comfortably exist side by side.

      <TEXT>When the Islamic State raised its black flag over the Syrian city of Raqqa in early 2014, it began its transformation from fringe regional player to fearsome global threat. By the end of that year, it had seized large stretches of territory in Iraq and Syria, creating a rogue state the size of Britain.

Now, the last of that territory — a sliver of land along the Euphrates River in southeastern Syria — has been retaken. Thousands of fighters remain in the region, but they have gone underground, carrying out quick strikes in the region and continuing to promote their ideology worldwide.

Here are some of the major moments in the group’s evolution:

The Islamic State traces its roots to Al Qaeda in Iraq, an offshoot of the terrorist group that attacked the United States on Sept. 11, 2001. The Iraqi affiliate started an insurgency that pushed Iraq to the brink of civil war in 2006 and 2007, before it suffered defeat at the hands of American troops and local militias.

By 2013, remnants of the Qaeda affiliate had rebranded themselves the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, and had identified opportunities in Syria, which was in the third year of its civil war. The Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, an Iraqi, was the architect of the group’s push to seize territory and declare its own state.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The Kansas Jayhawks entered the postseason with their wings clipped. Having lost two stars midseason — one to an N.C.A.A. suspension, one to unspecified “personal matters” — they could well sustain double-digit losses for only the second time in 19 seasons.

Yet according to the Rating Percentage Index statistic, which typically saturates bracketological prognostications ahead of the N.C.A.A. tournament’s Selection Sunday reveal, Kansas was, as of Friday morning, the top-ranked men’s basketball team in the country — higher than Kentucky, which beat Kansas handily in January; higher than Virginia, which had zero losses to teams not named Duke; higher even than Duke and its basketball messiah, Zion Williamson.

So should you start penciling Kansas in as one of the four No. 1 seeds before the bracket is released on Sunday night?

Not so fast. While you can still find websites that calculate R.P.I., the statistic is officially no more in the men’s game. The N.C.A.A., which created it nearly four decades ago, disowned it in the statistic’s most prominent sport last year.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>ST. CLOUD, Minn. — John Mariucci and Herb Brooks, considered the godfathers of modern college hockey in Minnesota, never could have envisioned this in their lifetimes. But when Coach Bob Motzko left St. Cloud State after last season to succeed the retiring Don Lucia at the University of Minnesota, he arguably made a lateral move, not a step up.

Such a notion would have been hockey heresy in the 1950s and ’60s, when Mariucci coached the Golden Gophers to national prominence, or the 1970s, when Brooks led Minnesota to three N.C.A.A. titles before coaching the 1980 United States Olympic team to the Miracle on Ice.

The Gophers used to be the premier program in the state, but that has changed.

Last season St. Cloud State, Minnesota Duluth and Minnesota State qualified for the N.C.A.A. tournament, with St. Cloud claiming the overall No. 1 seed and Minnesota Duluth winning its second national title this decade. Minnesota, a five-time national champion, missed the 16-team tournament for the second time in three seasons.

And the balance of power continues to shift. St. Cloud State (27-4-3) remained atop both national polls this week, with Minnesota Duluth (21-11-2) fourth. Minnesota State (29-7-2) is second in one poll and third in the other. As the teams begin their conference tournaments this weekend, St. Cloud, Minnesota State and Minnesota Duluth are all in line for No. 1 seeds in the N.C.A.A. tournament.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Peter B. Kaplan, a photographer who captured spectacular views from vertiginous vantage points like the torch of the Statue of Liberty and the masts of the Empire State Building and the original World Trade Center, died on March 19 in Wilmington, Del. He was 79.

His wife, Sharon R. Kaplan, said the cause was interstitial lung disease, which she attributed in part to his inhaling debris in Lower Manhattan after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

Mr. Kaplan first experimented with his gravity-defying bird’s-eye panoramas long before the advent of drones, extended selfie sticks and permissions for helicopters to hover close to skyscrapers.

He persuaded architects, developers and public officials to let him immortalize their buildings and monuments on film in altitudinous detail. He would scale precarious perches with construction workers and point his lens toward the ground hundreds of feet below, or mount his camera, sometimes equipped with a fisheye lens, on poles as long as 42 feet, so he could snap the shutter remotely and even photograph himself.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Michael Lynne, who helped engineer a bold expansion of the once tiny studio New Line Cinema that culminated in its release of the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy, one of the most successful movie franchises in history, died on Monday in Manhattan. He was 77.

His daughter, Elizabeth Planet, said the cause was cancer.

Mr. Lynne was an entertainment lawyer in the early 1980s when he began advising his old Columbia Law School classmate Robert Shaye, who had founded New Line in 1967. He became the studio’s general counsel in 1984, the same year it released one of its biggest early successes, the horror movie “A Nightmare on Elm Street,” which cost less than $2 million to make and brought in more than $25 million at the box office. He also joined the New Line board, and in 1986 he played a crucial role in taking the company public.

In 1990 Mr. Shaye made Mr. Lynne president and chief operating officer. That year also brought another huge hit for the studio, “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,” which was made for $13.5 million and earned 10 times that just in the United States.</TEXT>

How stupid would it be for me, with my crazy past and what I’ve been through — oh, right now I just think I need to be a monster, hold girls against their will, chain them up in my basement, and don’t let them eat, don’t let them out!”

      <TEXT>Federal authorities investigating Russian interference in the presidential election obtained search warrants for emails of Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s former lawyer and fixer, beginning in July 2017, according to documents released Tuesday that provided a glimpse into the earliest stages of the inquiry into the president.

The documents show that by the time F.B.I. agents conducted a highly public raid on Mr. Cohen’s home and office in April of last year, his business dealings had already been the subject of an extensive investigation. 



The records, including search warrants and other materials related to the April raid, were among nearly 900 pages of documents that a federal judge unsealed in response to a request by The New York Times and other news organizations.

The records were heavily redacted. More than 150 pages were fully blacked out, and many had names or portions of the material obscured, mostly because they were related to the continuing investigation of the Trump Organization.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Fuzzy and enveloping, cuddly and adorable, the MaxMara Teddy Bear coat is like a Snuggie with buttons.

With its dropped shoulders, cozy pockets and blend of alpaca and mohair, it is the outerwear version of that cute animal at the foot of the bed. Unprepossessing in design terms, it has also proved to be that rarity:a retailing monster that since being introduced on a MaxMara runway at a 2013 fashion show has sold more than 17,000 and generated over $50 million in revenues, according to a company spokesman.

“I remembered a certain type of coat in the ’80s made from rich, deep pile, and I had a feeling that kind of coat was missing and would tap into the zeitgeist,” Ian Griffiths, the coat’s designer, said recently when asked about the origins of the design. It experienced a modest burst of popularity in its first season, thanks mostly to street-style shots posted to social media of the French fashion editor Carine Roitfeld wrapped in a borrowed Teddy Bear coat.

“That image of Carine wearing it in cold Milan went viral, and sales popped,” Mr. Griffiths said. “Then they went a little bit quiet.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>DAKAR, Senegal — They sprint. They sweat. They squat to the ground and bounce backward. They sit side-by-side and lock arms for group situps. They dig trenches in the sand for stability, to get more out of each push up.

And, then, when the rush-hour traffic really backs up and exhaust fumes pour across this little, sandy triangle of an outdoor gym bordered by a highway and two exit ramps, sometimes the athletes vomit.

“Sports and pollution,” said Joseph Faye, a wrestling coach who was grappling with other young men there on a recent evening, “they don’t go together.”

Increasingly in Dakar, where outdoor exercise is a way of life, the two are colliding.

On any given evening, thousands of runners, wrestlers, soccer players and fitness fanatics take to the beaches and streets for a strenuous workout.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>That, of course, is ridiculous. There are plenty of ways the editors can get back at me without publishing a crazy puzzle, such as putting salt in the office sugar bowl.

But my point is, it’s not a vowel progression. It’s a nice, clean set of LP phrases.

Andrea Carla Michaels: Every now and then, Kevin sends me a ton of creative ideas to see if anything strikes me. We have radically different styles, though complementary, so we like to collaborate. He is a grid master with out-of-the-box ideas (see his Mullet puzzle!). We've made a lot of puzzles, but this is only our second one for The New York Times.

Two-word phrases that start with the same two letters are fairly straightforward, so we were able to generate a long list of possible theme answers.

After arguing whether LILY PAD is one or two words, or how well-known LUKE PERRY is (who knew how timely?) we put together a set … and neither of those made the final cut.

What makes this unusual is that Kevin managed to get seven theme entries (plus a three- letter reveal) into a Monday puzzle. My job was to make the fill as smooth as I could. (There is a bonus theme answer if you parse 23D, perhaps clued as &quot;Hollywood dog star?&quot;)

Kevin Christian: I like collaborating with Andrea for many reasons. She's easy to get along with and has a great sense of humor. When I bring her an idea, she always does something to it that makes it better. Most important, she's a fantastic judge of what is and is not clean fill.

We had many LP expressions to choose from for this puzzle. Some of my favorites that didn't make the cut were LUNG POWER, LINKIN PARK (we miss you, Chester Bennington), LATERAL PASS, LITMUS PAPER, LANDING PARTY, LIBRARY PASTE, LOTUS POSITION, LACROSSE PLAYER and LEARNER’S PERMIT.

I'm glad we were able to get seven theme answers into the puzzle, and to make two of them Downs that crossed some of the Across theme answers. That was not easy to pull off. There was no guarantee that it was going to work, but we were able to do it, which was great.

For the record, I still don't know if LILY PAD is one word or two without Googling it. It's two, right?</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Fire cider is an herbal concoction that steeps for weeks and emerges tangy and hot. It is a pungent brew made from apple cider vinegar, onions, garlic and horseradish, sometimes with citrus and hot peppers thrown in. Proponents claim it has beneficial properties.

Lately fire cider has become known for another property: its ability to electrify the typically serene herbalist community. The contentious tonic is the subject of a lawsuit filed in Massachusetts that, when it goes to trial this month, will pit timeworn traditions against cold, hard capitalism. The question to be answered in court: Who has the right to sell fire cider — and still call it “fire cider”?

The conflict began in 2012, when a Massachusetts company called Shire City Herbals trademarked the name of its signature drink, which comes in three flavors and is now carried in all 50 states. Dana St. Pierre , 40, who founded the company with his wife and brother-in-law, said he learned the basics of making fire cider from his German grandmother, a medical skeptic who often relied on home remedies.

Mr. St. Pierre said that he tinkered with her recipe for decades, adding habanero peppers and lemons for kick, steeping the brew for four weeks at a time, until it tasted just right. According to his version of events, he came up with the name “fire cider” and around 2010, began s elling it at local craft fairs and farmers markets. Soon after, on the advice of a customer, he trademarked the brand name to protect his small family business from being copied by larger companies.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>In the chaos following Tywin Lannister’s death, many characters attempt to take control, often in the face of intransigent foes — religious fanatics, political insurgents, armies of the dead. Trying to pick apart the intricate plot? Thinking along these themes and settings might help.

Two knights set off to rescue a princess in Dorne. Never mind that she’s feisty and in love and doesn’t want to go home. (She should, though — her life is in danger in ways she doesn’t understand.) A would-be knight and squire set off to rescue a princess in the North; she refuses their aid as well. Both of these rescue attempts fail at first, but later sort of succeed — when it’s too late, unfortunately. (Myrcella gets poisoned; Sansa gets raped.) These things happen all the time in Westeros (and Essos), where the characters are determined to save not just other people but whole classes of people, even countries. “Westeros needs to be saved from itself,” Varys says.

Jon Snow, an action hero if ever there were one, wants to save the wildlings to prevent them from becoming soldiers in the Night King’s army. But the Free Folk waste valuable time arguing about this, and then the Night King and his minions roll up. Thousands of people die (thus qualifying to join the army of the dead). The dragonglass is lost. The Night’s Watch — not thrilled that Jon’s bringing the surviving wildlings through the Wall — decides to kill him. Rescue attempts will not succeed simply because the rescuer has honorable intentions. After Dany takes off on her first flight on Drogon, her people decide that she needs a rescue from her rescue. Why does it occur to no one in this world that maybe she doesn’t — that maybe she will be the one to save them?

What do you do when you need some dirty deed done that you can’t do yourself? In Westeros and Essos, it’s simple: Use a proxy! Hire a Faceless Man to assassinate anyone you like and make it look like an accident. Deploy the Sons of the Harpy to mount violent protests against abolition (not a popular idea among former slave masters). Or empower the Sparrows (now the Faith Militant) to simply arrest your enemies.

Using a proxy has the added advantage of affording some degree of anonymity — something most of these shadowy organizations also prize. The Sons of the Harpy go masked on their terrorist excursions. The Faceless Men require acolytes give up their belongings and their names. And the Sparrows must surrender their worldly possessions as well, even their shoes. The High Sparrow maintains a prudent distance from the violence done in his name, allowing him to put on a kindly and avuncular mask of his own. Of course, the Night King is the ultimate master of proxies — he’s able to compel masses of the dead to do his bidding. He doesn’t even have to ask (or pay) them.

Sex is a big deal on this show because it’s a form of power. That’s why Margaery crows about consummating her marriage with the king — the sex is what makes her queen. Sex outside of marriage is an even bigger deal this season, as brothels become a key part of the political landscape. Littlefinger’s brothel, managed by the male prostitute Olyvar, is raided by the Sparrows not once, but twice. The first time because the High Septon enjoys its services, the second just to shut the place down and make a statement about who’s in charge of King’s Landing now. And let’s not forget that Olyvar’s relationship with Loras Tyrell was only a means of spying on him for Littlefinger and Cersei. Even though Littlefinger also facilitates highborn marriage arrangements, don’t forget that he is actually a pimp. (Or a flesh-peddler, as Lancel calls him. Whichever you prefer.)</TEXT>

President Trump has drawn fire from some critics for his response to the shootings at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, on Friday that left 50 people dead. The suspect in the attack had praised Trump in a manifesto, calling him “a symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose.”

Stephen Colbert played a tape of New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, saying that she had asked Trump to express his “sympathy and love for all Muslim communities.” Colbert then joked that he didn’t expect that to pan out.

Trump did publicly express his sympathies for the victims, but Colbert was not satisfied. Over the weekend, Trump continued to push for the building of a border wall, using the word “invasion” to describe the flow of immigrants on the southern border. (The New Zealand gunman also used that word). And the president tweeted his discontent with Fox News after it suspended the host Jeanine Pirro because she expressed anti-Muslim views.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The Nets needed a win, and they got their easiest one ever in Brooklyn.

DeMarre Carroll scored 22 points, Rodions Kurucs had 19 and the Nets easily ended a three-game losing streak with a 127-88 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Monday night.

Caris LeVert added 18 points and Spencer Dinwiddie finished with 16 on a night when the Nets shook up their starting lineup but were fueled by their reserves. The 39-point margin was their most lopsided victory at home — and matched their biggest victory over all — since moving from New Jersey in 2012.

“This was definitely a game for us to build off of,” guard D’Angelo Russell said. “Coming into this one, we knew we had to get it. We know we’ve got a tough stretch coming up, so we need all the confidence we can get.”

The Nets were routed by teams below them in the standings in their last three games but led nearly the entire way, with the lead ballooning to 44 points. The Nets moved back into a tie for sixth place in the East.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Good morning. It’s Monday, and I hope you’ve got a full bottle of red wine at the ready. You’re going to need it to make dinner. That’s right, put on a big pot of salted water, because it’s red wine spaghetti night! (Are there four better consecutive food words than “red wine spaghetti night”? I don’t think so.)

David Tanis has the recipe for spaghetti ubriachi (above), or drunken pasta, and it starts with rendering the fat from some pancetta, then using it to sweat onion and garlic, red-pepper flakes and tomato paste. The wine reduces quickly to make a tangy, burgundy-colored sauce, and then all the dish needs is butter and cheese and a handful of basil leaves. Make sure to get another bottle to drink with dinner, of course.

On to sweets! Melissa Clark has not one, but three (three!) new recipes for snacking cakes this week. If you’ve got some soft, blackening bananas on the counter, a bit past their prime, they’ll be perfect for her buttery banana cake, covered with a salty, sticky caramel glaze.

But if your bananas are still firm and yellow, you might want to bake something else today, like her bittersweet chocolate cake with a citrus glaze (tangerines, mandarins, whatever you’ve got will work great). Baking with oil, instead of butter, makes the crumb on this especially soft and tender (and means it keeps really well, too, if you’re baking for the next day). And if even sharper citrus desserts are your jam, the gorgeous lemon cake made with tons of grated zest and covered with coconut glaze might be the way to go.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>That’s some road trip that’s been mapped out by the three drunken travelers now bending an elbow at Joe’s Pub at the Public Theater. (I mean the ones onstage.) In “Anything That Gives Off Light,” a wide-ranging work of stand-up musical theater from the Brooklyn-based troupe the TEAM and the National Theater of Scotland, two Scots and an American meet in a London bar.

The Scots are Brian (Reuben Joseph) and Iain (Martin Donaghy), and, in happier times, they were the best of friends. They call the American woman (Jessica Almasy) Red because she never says what her real name is (or if she does, I didn’t catch it) but has ordered a “red daiquiri.”

Red, who comes from the mountains of West Virginia, is on what she describes as a second honeymoon, but without her husband. Iain has arrived from Scotland bearing the ashes of Brian’s recently deceased granny, a firebrand who used to take the young’uns on protest marches. Brian, who appears to devote his life to getting and spending in London, seems to have little interest in either returning to his homeland or revisiting his past. Everybody is on edge.

Still, as the song that opens the show reminds us, there’s nothing like a “long-handled whisky bottle” to blur any unpleasantness. And before the first flush of intoxication has faded into a grayer shade, Brian, Iain and Red are in a rental car bound for Scotland. That country, in this rendering, turns out to be an exceedingly mutable land, fixed in neither time nor place.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to block a Trump administration initiative banning bump stocks, the attachments that enable semiautomatic rifles to fire in sustained, rapid bursts.

The court’s action, in a one-sentence order, means that the regulation will remain in force while challenges to it move forward in the courts. There were no noted dissents.

The case concerns executive power, not the Second Amendment. The lead plaintiff, Gun Owners of America, which describes itself as “the ‘no compromise’ gun lobby,” argued that the administration had exceeded its authority by banning bump stocks under federal laws that largely ban machine guns. (The National Rifle Association was not a party to the suit.)

Bump stocks work by harnessing a firearm’s recoil energy to allow it to keep firing after a single pull of the trigger. The Justice Department has said this transforms semiautomatic weapons into fully automatic machine guns.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Just days after saying that it would close most of its stores, Tesla is making an abrupt U-turn.

In a message posted on its blog just before midnight Sunday, the electric-car maker said it had decided to retain many of the locations it had shut down or was planning to close. And it said it would raise most of its vehicle prices about 3 percent worldwide, just weeks after cutting prices.

“Over the past two weeks we have been closely evaluating every single Tesla retail location, and we have decided to keep significantly more stores open than previously announced as we continue to evaluate them over the course of several months,” the company said in the blog post. The price increases, it said, are necessary to make up for the loss of savings that was anticipated from the store closings.

The flip-flops are the latest sign of turmoil surrounding the company and its chief executive, Elon Musk.

“This reversal is bizarre and indicates a lack of actual planning in the earlier announcement,” said Mike Ramsey, a Gartner analyst. “Their retail stores still serve a real need.”</TEXT>

• President Trump plans to begin a fresh effort on Monday to pressure Congress to pay for a border wall. He is expected to request $8.6 billion in his annual budget proposal, and another $3.6 billion to replenish military construction funds he has diverted to begin work on the wall. But with Democrats in control of the House, his plan is likely dead on arrival.
• The relationship between Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has no precedent in their countries’ history, but it has deep parallels in their politics and struggles with scandal. As an Israeli election approaches, is this the last hurrah?
• After last week’s intraparty fight over Representative Ilhan Omar, many Democrats worry that a major response will now be required every time a member transgresses the ill-defined rules of rhetorical decorum.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court heard arguments on Monday in a voting-rights case with several unusual twists, including disagreements among Virginia officials about who was entitled to represent the state.

The case, a race-discrimination challenge to parts of the voting map for Virginia’s House of Delegates, was making its second appearance at the court. In 2017, the justices instructed a three-judge Federal District Court to take a fresh look at whether racial consideration had played too large a role in drawing the legislative map for the state’s House of Delegates.

The case concerns 11 voting districts drawn after the 2010 census, each with at least a 55 percent population of black residents of voting age. Democratic voters in those districts sued, saying that lawmakers had run afoul of the Constitution by packing too many black voters into the districts, diminishing their voting power.

The district court, which had initially upheld the districts, struck them down last year.

The Supreme Court has called for very close scrutiny of a state’s action when race was shown to be the predominant reason in creating legislative districts. (Next week, the court will hear two cases on the separate and open question of whether extreme partisan gerrymandering, in which the political party in power draws maps to give an advantage to its candidates, can ever cross a constitutional line.)</TEXT>

      <TEXT>MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — In a short stretch of Saturday afternoon, the Miami Open lost two of its biggest attractions — and just held on to a third. Top-ranked Naomi Osaka lost her third-round match, 4-6, 7-6(4), 6-3 to 27th-seeded Hsieh Su-wei. Midway through Osaka’s match, Serena Williams, an eight-time tournament champion, unexpectedly withdrew, citing a left knee injury.

Osaka, who had emerged as the sport’s best front-runner, had won 63 straight matches when winning the first set, dating to 2016. Osaka also led early in the third set, 2-0, before Hsieh leveled and then took a 4-3 lead she did not let go. Hsieh, a crafty 33-year-old veteran, closed out the victory on her first match point, hitting an overhead smash that Osaka blocked back, and then finishing off the point with an unreturnable slice volley.

Osaka had beaten Hsieh earlier this year in the third round of the Australian Open, 5-7, 6-4, 6-1. Hsieh has used her unorthodox game of jabs and feints to establish a reputation as a giant killer; she knocked then-No. 1 Simona Halep out of the third round of Wimbledon last year.

”It’s always great to pick up a better level during the match,” Hsieh said in her on-court interview. “Every time you’ve made it and you beat a good player, you feel, ‘Wow, this is everything. This is so amazing, and I’ve made it.’”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>A Design Gallery to Feel at Home In

On Monday, the influential design gallery the Future Perfect will open Casa Perfect New York, a West Village brownstone furnished with emerging contemporary design — one of the most exciting retail events in the field since Murray Moss opened his namesake store in 1994. The 19th-century house was formerly owned by the financier Nathaniel Rothschild who, in 2001, undertook a dramatic renovation of the space with the British architect David Chipperfield, who installed an angular oak staircase that zigzags up through the front third of the Italianate structure.

In the words of owner David Alhadeff, the bold move to open a gallery in a townhouse is a response to the “increasing irrelevance of traditional retail.” He adds, “It’s more and more difficult to get people out from behind their computers, but this kind of experience is what is working now.” Alhadeff had the idea for Casa Perfect New York almost immediately after he opened Casa Perfect in Los Angeles in 2017. (The current West Coast Casa Perfect is a Beverly Hills estate formerly owned by Elvis Presley.) Showing a roster of exciting young designers in a residential space has appealed to collectors who spend time lounging around the house as if they were at the home of a friend. “I’ve invited you over to hang out, and yeah, you can shop if you want,” says Alhadeff, who exudes a laid-back but infectious enthusiasm.

The Future Perfect, which opened in Williamsburg in 2003 and championed then-unknown designers Lindsey Adelman, Jason Miller and Fort Standard, has grown steadily over the last 16 years. In 2008, Alhadeff moved the gallery to Great Jones Street and over the last decade has expanded his program to include European designers, such as Dimore Studio and Marta Sala Editions. At a time when many retail businesses are scaling back, Alhadeff sees opportunities to expand. The new home is roughly twice the size of the current Great Jones Street space, a testament to the strength of the current market for contemporary design and its importance to the city. Casa Perfect New York will open by appointment starting Monday, March 11. — TOM DELAVAN</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“Catastrophe” began with Sharon and Rob (played by the show’s creators Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney) in a panicked state over an accidental pregnancy following a brief fling. As the show has progressed, the couple has grown into their relationship (more or less) and they are now the parents of two kids. They still experience moments of insecurity about the state of their union, and occasionally find themselves on the verge of ending it. (At one point Sharon asks Rob, “Were you unhappy the whole time?”) But in the show’s final season, this unlikely alliance enters a new, bittersweet phase, one in which we see that love and resentment can coexist, and hope and despair, too. The closing moment is as perfect (and perfectly ambiguous) as a series finale can get.

The Polish director Pawel Pawlikowski’s Oscar-nominated film is an enchanting black-and-white drama about a tempestuous love affair set against the backdrop of the Cold War. Wiktor (Tomasz Kot), a pianist and composer, and Zula (Joanna Kulig), a singer, begin a romance as they tour Poland performing folk songs in service of communist propaganda; they are eventually separated, but over the course of a decade they continue to find a way back to one another, only to lose touch again. This is a haunting story in which silence does much of the speaking.

“If anyone asks, that girl does not exist,” says the federal agent Marissa (Mireille Enos), trying to preclude public awareness of this show’s titular teenage assassin. Based on Joe Wright’s 2011 film of the same name, this “Hanna” shares the same writer (David Farr, here the showrunner) and features the newcomer Esme Creed-Miles in the role originated by Saoirse Ronan and Joel Kinnaman as Hanna’s guardian/trainer. It’s nice to see Kinnaman and Enos together again (they co-starred in the AMC series “The Killing”) and to find that the show wisely swaps out some of the movie’s curious aesthetic choices (like the ethereal fairy tale motifs) in order to spend more time on character development, world-building and breathtaking action sequences.

Also arriving: “The American” (March 1), “Boston Legal” Seasons 1-5 (March 1), “The Widow” Season 1 (March 1), “American Beauty” (March 1), “Big Night” (March 1), “The Chumscrubber” (March 1), “Deep Red” (“Profondo rosso”) (March 1), “Little House on the Prairie” Seasons 1-9 (March 1), “Nacho Libre” (March 1), “The Practice” Seasons 1-9 (March 1), “The Unit” Seasons 1-4 (March 1), “Tin Star” Season 2 (March 8) and “Colette” (March 12).</TEXT>

      <TEXT>This was always the logical blueprint for Mike Trout, the greatest and least complicated player in baseball. Trout would not sell himself short financially, but he also would not draw out the process of determining his future. He and the Los Angeles Angels would wait for Bryce Harper to set a contract record in free agency, and then make a deal that would break it.

That is what has happened, apparently, with Trout and the Angels finalizing a 10-year, $360 million contract extension with no opt-outs, a deal that will bring the Angels’ total commitment to nearly $430 million for Trout over the next 12 seasons, through 2030.

The agreement, which was first reported by ESPN, is expected to be formalized soon, according to two people who had been briefed on it but were not authorized to comment publicly. It is the fourth megadeal reached this spring training, following those for Nolan Arenado (eight years, $260 million with the Colorado Rockies), Manny Machado (10 years, $300 million with the San Diego Padres) and Bryce Harper (13 years, $330 million with the Philadelphia Phillies).

Those contracts did little to quell the angst of the players’ association about the relatively subdued state of the overall free agent market. The union has become so suspicious of ownership that it has moved some camp visits outside of clubhouses this spring training, for fear of possible surveillance inside team facilities. The union is dismayed at the lackluster bidding for the sort of midlevel free agents who until recently had generated much more interest on the open market.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Pearl’s Tigers like to shoot. A lot. From a long way out.

Auburn had made 38.2 percent of its 3-point attempts this season, accounting for 43.5 percent of the Tigers’ scoring. Their 421 made 3-point field goals led the nation going into Friday’s game, and their 1,113 attempts were the second most in the country.

But after Friday’s win, guard J’Von McCormick said his teammates’ defense should not be overlooked. “We knew transition defense was the key,” he said of Auburn’s eight steals.

When the Tigers headed to the locker room at halftime on Friday with a 41-39 lead, they were thinking of reloading rather than catching their breath. The teams had combined to take 70 shots; for Auburn, half came from beyond the 3-point arc and, truth be told, they were mostly off the mark: 5 for 19.

That changed drastically in the second half, but not before the Tigers had their hearts stopped. After they took a 64-54 lead, the left leg of their sophomore big man, Chuma Okeke, seemed to buckle.

The arena went silent. Okeke was given a towel to bite on for comfort. He hobbled into the locker room with 20 points and 11 rebounds, and then went to an emergency room for an X-ray on his knee.

Auburn, however, kept firing the ball up — quickly and from far away. Danjel Purifoy came off the bench and drained two consecutive 3-pointers to stretch the Tigers’ lead to 16. He had four 3-pointers altogether and finished with 14 points.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>MaryAnn DiMarco, 48, a medium and the author of “Believe, Ask, Act,” said that her clients are increasingly not looking for predictions. “They’re coming to me and saying, ‘I have so much going on in my life. Can you teach me how to make connection so that I can make transformation happen in my life for the better?’” she said.

Joshua Agan, 33, turned to Ms. DiMarco after contemplating suicide; he had weighed 400 pounds, altered his diet and started going to the gym, but wanted more changes. “Once my body was taken care of, then it kind of naturally went into me kind of chasing the spiritual component,” he said.

Mr. Agan, who owns a salon in Carmel, Ind., discovered Ms. DiMarco while attending a 2017 event hosted by Gabrielle Bernstein, a popular motivational speaker. He later flew to New York City with friends to attend a group reading and then, after Ms. DiMarco reached out to him personally with a message she said she felt she had to deliver to him, went back again for a one-on-one session, which she offered to him free of charge .

Ms. DiMarco, he said, allowed him to “step into my power and calmly let go of my existing experience,” he said. “And trust my spiritual side to lead me in the right direction. It doesn't come with total assurance, right?”

Lisa Levine, 42, is the founder of Maha Rose, a wellness center in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn that also operates a retreat center near the Catskill Mountains. She regularly hosts workshops with Ms. Nuur, the “clairvoyant intuitive” at In Goop Health, and said she believes there are people who can connect with the “other side” and bring back valuable information, but that the medium’s intention is crucial.

“Is their intention to be a conduit for the spirits and to be of service to their clients, or is their intention to make a lot of money?” Ms. Levine said. “Telling somebody something that you think they want to hear, although not necessarily damaging, is maybe just like putting a Band-Aid on something. And maybe that is all the person wants, a Band-Aid, or some type of ‘it’s O.K., your deceased mother forgives you or your passed father does love you.’”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>He was well enough to go to school for a couple of days that week, but by Thursday he felt bad again, and by that weekend he was a shadow of his usual self: tired, nauseated and much too quiet. When Greenhouse saw the child that Sunday morning, she was surprised by how sick he looked. He had clearly lost weight; he was listless and miserable. On careful examination, she noticed that subtle patches of slightly darkened skin shadowed his face, neck and upper torso, and his lips were dry and cracked. His heart was racing. When she saw a thin child with stomach problems, she worried about Type 1 diabetes and celiac disease. Greenhouse sent the mother and child to the lab for blood tests.

A couple of hours later, Greenhouse got the lab results. The child’s blood had critically low levels of sodium — one of the essential salts in the body. Low sodium, or hyponatremia, as it is called, isn’t a rare finding in children — vomiting or diarrhea can cause the sodium level to dip as the child becomes dehydrated. But typically it’s a mild drop of a few points below normal. This child’s sodium was much lower than that. And the causes of this type of electrolyte disturbance are rare and serious.

Disorders of the kidney — the organ that has the job of maintaining the right levels of all the salts in the body — are the most common causes of hyponatremia. Hormonal abnormalities, due to deficiencies in thyroid or adrenal hormones, can also cause low sodium levels. Head trauma, too, can lead the brain to misdirect the kidneys, resulting in salt-wasting. No matter the cause, untreated, this degree of hyponatremia can be deadly. Greenhouse told the mother to take her son to the hospital right away.

Greenhouse called the pediatric I.C.U. at Prisma Health Children’s Hospital in Columbia, S.C., to let them know she was sending her patient over. With a sodium level this low, the boy would need to be admitted to intensive care. When Greenhouse looked at the boy’s lab results, she thought she knew what he had. It wasn’t either of the diseases she had initially been worried about. His blood glucose level was fine, so he didn’t have diabetes. And he didn’t have any of the antibodies that indicate celiac disease. A closer look at the blood chemistries revealed that while low sodium was the most drastic finding, it was not the only abnormality. His potassium was slightly high. The combination of low sodium and high potassium suggested that the boy had a problem with his adrenal glands.

In children, adrenal insufficiency, also known as Addison’s disease, is usually caused by misguided warrior cells of the immune system destroying the thumb-size adrenal gland that sits on top of each kidney. These glands are the source of the “fight or flight” hormones, adrenaline and cortisol, which help the kidney manage the body’s level of sodium, potassium and glucose. When the adrenals are out of whack, patients are sick and tired. They often can’t keep anything down.</TEXT>

      <TITLE>Opinion | The Case for Expunging Criminal Records - The New York Times</TITLE>

      <TEXT>In addition, contrary to the fears of critics, people with expunged records break the law again at very low rates. Indeed, we found that their crime rates are considerably lower than those of Michigan’s general adult population . That may be in part because expungement reduces recidivism.

But another likely reason is that expungement recipients aren’t high risk to begin with. Like most states, Michigan requires a waiting period before expungement (five years after a person’s last interaction with law enforcement). Research in criminology indicates that people with records who go several years without another conviction are unlikely to offend again.

To be sure, if expanded laws cut down waiting periods or otherwise loosened eligibility requirements, the broader pools of recipients might have a higher baseline crime risk. But even then, there’s simply no reason to believe that expungement would increase those baseline crime risks. Again, if anything, access to jobs, housing and other benefits should reduce overall levels of crime.

So here’s the bad news: Hardly anyone gets expungements. According to information Michigan State Police provided to us, Michigan grants about 2,500 a year — but that’s a drop in the bucket compared to the number of criminal convictions there each year. Precise numbers are hard to come by, but we estimate that there are hundreds of thousands annually.

Relatively few people with records meet the legal requirements — but that’s not the only problem. Even among those who do qualify, we found that only 6.5 percent received expungements within five years of becoming eligible. Michigan judges have discretion to reject applications, but that’s not the big reason for this low rate. Rather, over 90 percent of those eligible don’t even apply.

Given the large potential benefits of expungement, why wouldn’t someone apply? We interviewed expungement lawyers and advocates for people with records, whose insights pointed to a clear set of explanations. Most people don’t know they can get an expungement, or don’t know how to do it, and don’t have lawyers to advise them. The process is long and complicated, requiring visits to police stations and courthouses. The fees and costs (which in Michigan usually total close to $100, not including transportation and time away from work) are a barrier for people in poverty. And people with records have often had painful experiences with the criminal justice system, making the prospect of returning to it for any reason daunting.

The low rate of applications for expungement is consistent with broader findings about the difficulties that poor and middle-class Americans face in dealing with the legal system. When the state makes it too hard or costly for citizens to exercise a right or opportunity, it’s not that different from denying that right or opportunity. Most people won’t be able to jump through all those hoops.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — By reaching the semifinals of the Miami Open, the Canadian youngsters Felix Auger-Aliassime and Denis Shapovalov achieved something that Roger Federer and John Isner never managed.

Federer, for all his obvious and precocious tennis talents, never made it to this late a stage of a Masters 1000 event in singles as a teenager. Isner was still a student-athlete at the University of Georgia in his late teens.

But neither Auger-Aliassime, 18, nor Shapovalov, 19, was able to make the next leap on Friday as Isner and Federer took turns holding back youth on the temporary center court at Hard Rock Stadium.

Federer, 37, and Isner, 33, will now play an old-guard final on Sunday.

On Friday afternoon, Isner was opportunistic in his 7-6 (3), 7-6 (4) victory against the silken Auger-Aliassime. In the evening, Federer was brilliant in his 6-2, 6-4 demolition of Shapovalov, a flashy left-hander with a one-handed backhand who grew up idolizing Federer and now has a much clearer understanding of what it is like to face him.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The Anti-Defamation League reported last year that the number of anti-Semitic incidents recorded in New York State rose by about 90 percent in 2017 compared to the previous year, and the number of such incidents in K-12 schools doubled to 36, from 18.

The Pine Bush district, which is about 18 miles west of Newburgh, N.Y., serves about 5,000 children from Orange, Sullivan and Ulster counties. In the 1970s, Pine Bush was the home of a Ku Klux Klan chapter president.

About a dozen current and former Pine Bush students interviewed off school grounds this week said the climate of harassment and bullying had improved, and programs and other steps taken by the district had helped.

But the students said problems of insensitivity remained, and not all of them thought Pine Bush school officials handled bias complaints satisfactorily. The students spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of harassment from other students or reaction from teachers.

One 18-year-old said he had not seen anything like the racism and harassment described in the lawsuit. He recalled taking the survey and thought it was good because “it helps gauge” what was going on in the school.

He said that teachers’ lessons on anti-Semitism had influenced his behavior. He admitted that he and his friends sometimes made bigoted statements, always in jest, he said. But since teachers have been impressing upon students that their words could cause unintended hurt, he said he had tried to avoid such talk and to police his friends. “I jump in and say, ‘O.K. this isn’t cool,’” he said.

Another student, who is 17, recalled a history class in which a teacher had discussed the Holocaust and tied the lesson to anti-Semitism at Pine Bush, which the student said had a big impact on his thinking. He said he felt anti-Semitism had largely disappeared from Pine Bush’s schools.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The chatter in certain New York society circles these days isn’t so much about who’s been invited, as who’s been indicted.

Last Friday, just after Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s prison-bound former lawyer, testified before Congress, several dozen socialites gathered at the United Nations for an awards luncheon celebrating the UN Women for Peace Association.

It was hard to miss Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, an association board member, whose 6-foot-1-inch frame was boosted by two-inch Manolo Blahnik heels. A close associate of Mr. Cohen, she had helped organize the president’s $107 million inauguration, the financing of which is now being investigated by federal prosecutors.

“Alexander McQueen, head to toe,” Ms. Winston Wolkoff said of her black suit with red accents.

Very chic. Also, have you been subpoenaed by the feds?</TEXT>

      <TEXT>In 1985, Michael J. Fox was one of the biggest stars in the world: “Back to the Future” and “Teen Wolf” occupied the top two spots at the box office, and “Family Ties,” the long-running sitcom on which he played Alex P. Keaton, was at its peak. “I wanted to be a rock star,” Fox told David Marchese in this week’s Talk interview. “That’s what I thought being famous was. But I wasn’t a rock star. I was kind of an idiot. I missed the point.” Six years later, Fox found out he had Parkinson’s disease, which he credits with getting him on track. Fox still acts occasionally — later roles include those on “Scrubs” and “Boston Legal” — but has dedicated his life to advocating a cure for Parkinson’s. Fox and Marchese talked about acting with Parkinson’s, taking the wrong roles and staying positive: “Until it’s not funny anymore, it is funny.”

He still believes in a cure for Parkinson’s.

His foundation, which has raised $800 million to combat the disease, has a working relationship with the government. (Still, Fox found himself upset when President Trump appeared to mock Serge Kovaleski, a reporter for The New York Times who has the joint condition arthrogryposis. But he didn’t feel the need to say anything in response: “People already know Trump is an [expletive].”) He’s still hopeful for a cure. In the interim, he’s optimistic about a new drug that acts like a rescue inhaler when people freeze, but knows that prophylactics are not a cure — but they’re better than nothing.

He worried about presenting a “false hope” about his diagnosis.

“I’d made peace with the disease but presumed others had that same relationship when they didn’t,” he told Marchese. But then his experience got worse: He found himself in a position where he couldn’t walk and had round-the-clock aides, and was unsure if he could still keep up his hopeful disposition. He’s working on a new book about wading through all this.

His response to the diagnosis was to make a number of comedic films: “For Love or Money,” “Life With Mikey” and “Greedy,” which were critical and commercial flops.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Good Wednesday morning. Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today.
• On Oct. 18, 2017, President Trump took the time to sign a $35,000 check to Michael D. Cohen, his longtime lawyer and fixer who had made hush payments to prevent alleged sexual misconduct by Mr. Trump from being exposed before the 2016 presidential election. It was one of 11 occasions that Mr. Trump or his trust cut such checks, six of which were provided this week to the The Times.
• Mr. Trump signaled that he did not intend to cooperate with the 81 document requests sent out by House lawmakers scrutinizing whether the president obstructed justice, and he called the investigation a “disgrace to our country.”
• The House’s Democratic leadership, responding to statements by Representative Ilhan Omar characterized as hurtful to Jews, will put to a vote a resolution condemning anti-Semitism. The resolution has started a furious generational debate between older House Democrats and their young, liberal counterparts.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>If Kraft is concerned about his own allegations, he is not showing it. While he has not spoken publicly about the charges, which the police said stem from video recordings of him, Kraft has been seen in public, including at a pre-Oscars brunch on Feb. 23 where he was photographed with Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder and chief executive.

When Kraft returned to Boston the next day, he was spotted hugging Patriots quarterback Tom Brady after they got off a private jet.

Amid the solicitation case in Florida, it is unclear how involved Kraft will be in league business in the coming months. The N.F.L. is preparing not only for talks with television networks but also for negotiations with the players’ union, whose contract expires at the end of next season. Kraft also sits on the finance and compensation committees, and the management council, which represents the league in labor talks.

Kraft can be an affable but cunning negotiator, and both his business and people skills were hard to miss in 2011 during negotiations over the collective bargaining agreement. Several owners pushed the league to take a hard line and exploit their leverage over the players’ union after a court ruling in their favor, but Kraft was among a contingent of owners leading negotiations in Washington who saw an opening to push the talks across the finish line. While Kraft shuttled back and forth to Boston, where his wife, Myra, was dying of ovarian cancer, he maintained a direct line of communication with leaders of the players’ union.

After the two sides reached a deal, Jeff Saturday, a member of the union’s executive committee, thanked Kraft. “Without him, this deal does not get done,” he said at the time.

ESPN, where Saturday works, said he was not available for an interview. But nearly all of Kraft’s associates contacted for this article said Kraft was a careful listener who asked questions and had a knack for proposing solutions. While he does have a temper, they said, he rarely loses it.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Ms. Prakash, who is 25, said the lack of a 2020 front-runner has allowed grass-roots groups to play the cohort of candidates against one another on certain issues. She expects Sunrise Movement to raise the standards for candidates from simply endorsing the Green New Deal to an even greater commitment: prioritizing the proposal in the first 100 days of any Democratic administration.

“Movements have changed everything,” she said, adding that Sunrise Movement plans to bring thousands of activists to the first Democratic presidential debate. “We are changing what it means for a politician to be a politician.”

Other groups have also tried to impose their legislative wish-lists on the presidential field. Fair Fight Action, the voting rights movement born out of last year’s contentious governor’s race in Georgia, has asked candidates to make election rights and voter suppression a more central theme of their pitch. Common Defense, a collection of antiwar veterans, is circling a pledge among Democratic candidates to end what they call the “forever war” waged by the United States since 2001, which has already been signed by Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders.

Jenifer Fernandez Ancona, who helps lead Women Donors Network, a collective that funds grass-roots organizations nationally, said that voters want politicians whose policies meet the present crisis. And she said candidates that resist will be penalized at the ballot box.

“The path to electability is through boldness right now,” she said. “It’s not just a litmus test for conversation; it’s actually going to show up in who is able to pass through these primary battles.”

Like Mr. Buttigieg in Philadelphia, candidates are often addressing these issues in response to questions, during town-hall style forums and interviews, rather than pushing the policies themselves.

“It’s all on the table, baby,” Ms. Warren said last Friday when asked about the filibuster at a rally in New York.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>That the massacre “began with ideas, and ended with violence” astutely sums up the killing of innocent Muslims in Christchurch, New Zealand. We must ask, What allowed those ideas to take root and spread in this part of the world?

As a New Zealand citizen and longtime resident of Christchurch, I am acutely aware of the presence of neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups in the region. They have had public rallies in the city center. They actively post racist messages on the internet. Why wasn’t the government adequately monitoring these groups and their hate speech?

Worse, the white supremacists were surely valorized and galvanized by politically opportunistic xenophobia. New Zealand’s current deputy prime minister, Winston Peters, has made a career out of mocking, intimidating and excluding Asian and Muslim migrants. In 2014 he publicly mocked Asians with his “two Wongs don’t make a right” remark. In 2017, he asked Muslim communities to “clean house,” implying that they were letting terrorist attacks happen. In 2018, he talked about “making New Zealand great again.”

This kind of racial derision and nationalistic rhetoric certainly fed the hate that led to the Christchurch massacre.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“I want to be here and be here the whole time,” he said.

The Yankees have eased Tulowitzki through spring training, with regular days off each week for his legs, and plan to do the same during the regular season. Torres will play shortstop during those days. And whenever Gregorius returns, the Yankees will have more to juggle.

“He looks like he’s just being athletic and being himself,” Yankees infielder D.J. LeMahieu said of Tulowitzki, who was also his teammate in Colorado. “He looks really good to me.”

Tulowitzki is undoubtedly motivated to prove the Blue Jays wrong — as well as those who thought he would never play again after his injuries. He said he wanted to show that older players could overcome hard times and still contribute.

But what guided him more than anything during the long, repetitive days of rehabilitation was his 5-year-old son, Taz, who does not remember seeing his father play in the major leagues two years ago.

“To get back out there and have him see me again was what I thought about each and every day,” Tulowitzki said.

Beginning on March 28, Tulowitzki will have the chance. When he was growing up in California, Tulowitzki watched the Yankees and later wore the same No. 2 jersey because of his deep admiration for a player who feels relevant now: Jeter.</TEXT>

Manafort Isn’t Out of the Woods

Stephen Colbert was disappointed to learn that Paul Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, had been sentenced on Thursday to less than four years in prison for financial fraud. That is far less than the roughly two decades recommended under sentencing guidelines.

But Colbert pointed out that there was still a chance Manafort would do more time: Next week, he will be sentenced in a separate trial.

“Manafort will receive a second jail sentence from a different federal judge for witness tampering and money laundering. You know you’re in trouble when the only time you get out of jail is to go get sentenced to more jail.” — STEPHEN COLBERT</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The Machine is back. But does it still creak?

This question loomed over the return, on Saturday afternoon, of Robert Lepage’s production of Wagner’s “Das Rheingold” to the Metropolitan Opera after a six-year absence.

Mr. Lepage’s ambitious staging of Wagner’s four-opera “Ring” cycle relies on a massive, complex set: 24 planks that rotate like seesaws on an axis that can rise and fall. This 44-ton “Machine,” as it became widely known, was prone to glitches on a Wagnerian scale, starting when “Das Rheingold,” the first installment, was introduced in 2010.

The planks can be twisted into sculptural set pieces and bathed in intricate video imagery. Debate among Wagner lovers over the Lepage “Ring” was heated from the start. But there was one thing everyone agreed on: The Machine too often squeaked and groaned when it kicked into action.

After a major retooling, it has been tamed — well, mostly. There were occasional creaking sounds on Saturday. But things seemed to work smoothly.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The Netflix series “Chef’s Table” sets a new standard for how TV shows about cooking could look and feel, bringing psychological depth and visual lyricism to the subject of food. Some of the “Chef’s Table” creative team will now take that same approach to the world’s street vendors in “Street Food,” a series focusing on the culture of entire cities and countries — including Singapore and India, in season one — rather than on the habits and obsessions of individual chefs.

‘She-Ra and the Princesses of Power’ Season 2

The rebooted version of the clunky ‘80s syndicated cartoon “She-Ra: Princess of Power” was one of 2018’s most pleasant TV surprises: a fusion of the original’s old-fashioned science-fiction/fantasy mythology with the cultural diversity, emotional richness and character-driven storytelling of more modern animated series. Even the name was changed, to reflect a premise that surrounds the title heroine with multiple magical warriors. Having introduced a teeming cast of complicated heroes and villains in season one, the series’ creator Noelle Stevenson and her staff of writers and illustrators will in year two be looking to put them into action in stories with more epic sweep.

“Roman Empire: Caligula: The Mad Emperor” (April 5), “Tijuana” (April 5), “Huge in France” (April 12), “Special” (April 12), “My First First Love” (April 18), “Samantha!” Season 2 (April 19), “Selection Day: New Episodes” (April 22), “Bonding” (April 24), “Archer” Season 9 (April 26), “The Protector” Season 2 (April 26) and “Yankee” (April 26)

Brie Larson is having a stellar 2019 so far, first starring in the international box-office smash “Captain Marvel,” and now seeing her 2017 directorial debut “Unicorn Store” finally get distribution via Netflix. Written by Samantha McIntyre, “Unicorn Store” stars Larson as Kit, an aimless, artsy young woman, who’s just about to settle for a dull-but-stable life in a corporate cubicle when she gets an offer from a mysterious stranger (played by Samuel L. Jackson), who says he can sell her a unicorn. The film’s quirkily colorful images are in service of a whimsical story, meant to raise questions about what it means — realistically — to “follow your dream.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>No one, from the president on down, knew exactly when the report would come or what it would say. With his usual bravado about his base, Trump told Fox’s Maria Bartiromo that “people will not stand for it” if the report was damning.

All we really knew was that this was a pivotal moment, not only for Trump but also for his Javert. If the special counsel delivered a weak gruel, after all the time, money, newsprint and digital space lavished on it, people would demand to know why he hadn’t pulled the plug long ago.

By Friday morning, White House officials had been feeling better and Democrats who had once fantasized that Mueller would put Trump in a jumpsuit to match his hair began to emphasize that it was their congressional investigations and New York prosecutors that were going to bring Trump to justice.

Still, no one knew for sure.

It was not thought that Trump would be indicted, because Justice Department rules say a president can’t be indicted. So, the question was: Would Mueller imply that the only thing that saved Trump from an obstruction charge was the fact that he was sitting in the Oval Office? How much evidence would Mueller show that Trump actually tried to obstruct justice?

As Happy Hour approached, Attorney General William Barr notified White House and congressional leaders that Mueller had delivered his report. The two Republicans are good friends who go back decades, a fact that startled Trump when Barr mentioned it during his confirmation hearings. (When Barr was attorney general the first time, under George H.W. Bush, he was Mueller’s boss, when Mueller led the criminal division.)

In his letter to the leaders of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, Barr said he might be able to brief them on the main conclusions of the report this weekend. The Justice Department said no more indictments were coming in the Russia investigation. Could Don Jr. and Jared have shaken off the bloodhounds?</TEXT>

      <TEXT>SAN FRANCISCO — The Department of Energy disclosed details on Monday of one of the most expensive computers being built: a $500 million machine based on Intel and Cray technology that may become crucial in a high-stakes technology race between the United States and China.

The supercomputer, called Aurora, is a retooling of a development effort first announced in 2015 and is scheduled to be delivered to the Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago in 2021. Lab officials predict it will be the first American machine to reach a milestone called “exascale” performance, surpassing a quintillion calculations per second.

That’s roughly seven times the speed rating of the most powerful system built to date, or 1,000 times faster than the first “petascale” systems that began arriving in 2008. Backers hope the new machines will let researchers create significantly more accurate simulations of phenomena such as drug responses, climate changes, the inner workings of combustion engines and solar panels.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“We are seeing more and more people planning ahead,” said Mr. Ison of Woodlawn. Seven years ago, he added, 40 percent of people made arrangements ahead of time, or “pre-need” rather than “at need” (by which time prices may have increased); last year, 60 percent did.

Antonia Russo pulled it off just in time.

In the summer of 2017, her mother was ailing, which lent urgency to the search for a burial plot for her parents. They had lived in Forest Hills, Queens, for most of their adult lives, but were born and raised in Bedford-Stuyvesant and remained “proud Brooklynites,” Ms. Russo said.

So in consultation with her parents, she opted for a spot on the Brooklyn side of the Evergreens Cemetery, which straddles Brooklyn and Queens. Ms. Russo passed up a plot on a grassy knoll under a tree in favor of one bordering Bushwick Avenue, because she felt that her mother, who had always lived on busy streets, would feel more at home. “I knew this was where she’d be happy,” Ms. Russo said.

Two weeks after the papers were signed, her mother passed away.

Cemetery plot location, like all real estate, usually comes down to personal preference, said John O. D’Arienzo, a funeral home director and the president of the Metropolitan Funeral Directors Association. “If you take 100 people, 50 people will want to be by the road, so if it’s cold they can see the stone from the car,” he said. “The other 50 will want to be in the middle of the section, so everyone doesn’t walk all over the grave.”

He added: “It’s like who wants a blue house, who wants a red house.”

John Crawford, a retired hotel worker who lives on the Upper West Side, frequents death cafes and attended a recent one at the St. Agnes library branch on Amsterdam Avenue. Mr. Crawford is leaning toward a green burial at the Town Cemetery in Rhinebeck, N.Y., where a natural burial ground opened in 2014 on land that was once part of an estate.

The spot appeals to him in part because of its price: $1,650, which is $400 more than it costs to be buried in the conventional part of the same cemetery, but far less than what most cemeteries in New York City charge.

“I may not have a country home,” he said. “But at least I could get buried out there in the country.”

      <TEXT>It used to be said that a conservative is a liberal who has been mugged. Today she’s a liberal who tried to pay a babysitter without breaking the law. It is admirable that Democrats try to tackle society’s thorniest problems with the often unwieldy tools of government, but that is not an excuse for programs that are too complex for their own good.

The truth is that good public policy can actually be elegant and simple to understand, even when the social problem that it’s addressing is complex. Social Security, Medicare, bans on indoor smoking, the “do not call” list (when it worked) and public libraries are examples of government solutions that are easy to understand and to benefit from.

Avoidance of complexity and minimizing choices are hallmarks of good design, as we have learned from the technological revolution in user interfaces. The age of impossible-to-use computers and incomprehensible TV remote controls has given way to the sleek and intuitive interfaces offered by pioneers like Steve Jobs of Apple. What progressives most need now is not more brains, but better policy designers.

One major obstacle to simple, effective public policy is people like me — the expert class. Many of us are in denial, seeing complexity as a necessary evil, an unavoidable feature of answers to hard problems, even a technocratic badge of honor. We criticize conservatives for relying on simplistic slogans like “cut taxes” and “drill, baby, drill” instead of nuanced, empirically informed assessments of economic growth and environmental management.

Progressives are right to consider expertise essential to good policymaking. But policy experts are rarely good at interface design, for we have a bad habit of assuming that people have unlimited time and attention and that to respect them means offering complete transparency and a multiplicity of choices. Real respect for the public involves appreciating what the public actually wants and needs. The reality is that most Americans are short on time and attention and already swamped by millions of daily tasks and decisions. They would prefer that the government solve problems for them — not create more work for them.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I thought of that study yesterday, after the Justice Department announced it had indicted 50 people for trying to rig the admissions process. The alleged scam involved payments funneled from parents to college coaches, who in return would falsely identify applicants as athletic recruits to the admissions office. Just like that, the students then become virtual shoo-ins for acceptance.

If the accusations are true, they’re outrageous. But they also highlight a larger problem that has somehow become acceptable: A scam like this could exist only because competitive sports occupy a ridiculously large place in the admissions process.

The situation is different for other extracurricular activities. Great musicians are more likely to be admitted to a college than similar students who don’t play an instrument — as is only fair, because musicians deserve credit for their accomplishments. But the musicians don’t generally receive a 30-percentage-point boost on their admissions chances. Stage managers for the high school theater don’t, either. Nor do student body presidents, debaters, yearbook editors or robotics competitors.

Athletes do. Their extracurricular activities are not treated merely as an important part of a college application, but as a defining part. “Athletic recruiting is the biggest form of affirmative action in American higher education, even at schools such as ours,” as Philip Smith, a former dean of admissions at Williams College, has said. It’s a relic of the supposedly character-defining role that sports played in elite colleges a century ago.

And sports have retained their unique place in the admissions process even though most teams at elite colleges are not good enough to compete for national championships. To put it another way, the student athletes being recruited to these colleges are not among the very best in the country at what they do. They are extremely good, yes, and they work hard, yes — but that also tends to be true of high school musicians, student government leaders and so on.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Rent the Runway, the company known for lending designer dresses to women for special occasions, has received a new round of financing that increased its valuation to the unicorn level of $1 billion.

The valuation announced on Thursday is a milestone for Rent the Runway, which was founded a decade ago and has been working for years to expand its business beyond formal dress rentals. It introduced a subscription service for everyday clothing and accessories several years ago that has developed a particularly enthusiastic customer base among professional women. Recently, it announced a partnership with West Elm that will allow subscribers to rent “bundles” of pillows, throws and quilts for their living rooms and bedrooms.

“You’ll continue to see that this new living closet that we’ve created is going to apply not only to how you get dressed, but it’ll apply to all of the products that you use,” Jennifer Hyman, 38, the company chief executive and a co-founder, said in a phone interview. “Our goal is really to create the Amazon Prime of rental.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>A few months ago, I started a new job at a small company, with a leadership role. I’m feeling as if I am making a lot of positive changes and contributions to the operation and culture of the company, and generally like my co-workers and many aspects of the culture.

However, I’ve been blindsided by a major issue. It’s been abundantly clear since my first week that one of the two heads of the firm is an alcoholic. He’s displayed inappropriate behavior in the workplace, and regularly drinks heavily at work — even drinking steadily through presentations and new hire interviews.

As someone senior, but not an owner, in the company, I’m unsure of how to cope. There is of course no supervisor to report his behavior to, and his co-head is dealing with a long-term personal issue that makes approaching him inappropriate.

I’ve seen a lot of addiction in family and friends, and I know that this is an issue that won’t resolve until he himself recognizes the issue and decides to change. I’m also loath to re-enter the job market. I’d like to help right the ship as much as possible until at least one, or both, of the C.E.O.s can get back to more stable footing.

The definition of codependency is excessive reliance on others, particularly those who require a lot of support, for a sense of approval and identity. You are investing far too much in the people and the culture of this job. Step back: Is this job good for you? Will it look good on a résumé? Are you making a good salary? Are you gaining valuable experience? Once the answer to any of these questions is “no,” start looking for another job, even if the market is a special kind of hell.

Emotional distress is also worth considering, but you can reduce it in this case by very actively stepping back. As you wisely intuit, you’re not going to fix anything at all. As for coping directly with a boss who is an alcoholic: I might suggest keeping a journal documenting interactions that you have with him. It’s never a bad idea to cover your own derrière for when the lawsuits start to fly.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>SHALER, Pa. — This should be an upbeat moment for Pennsylvania Democrats, desperate to deprive President Trump of a second term.

In elections last year, two Trump-like Republicans running for governor and senator lost to Democrats by blowout margins. Four Democrats wrestled away Republican-held congressional seats, including Conor Lamb, whose victory here outside Pittsburgh seemed to be a template for how to win back voters in Trump country.

But, listening to strategists and voters in a critical state for Democrats, the midterms feel like a long time ago. Instead, there are widespread worries that the momentum in Pennsylvania, and in other key Rust Belt states, could screech to a halt if the issues in the 2020 presidential primaries and the party’s eventual nominee stray too far left for the region’s many centrist voters.

[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]

“The more we have presidential candidates or newly elected congresspeople talking about the Green New Deal, talking about ‘Medicare for all,’ talking about socialism, the more that plays into the Trump campaign’s hands,” said Ed Rendell, a former Pennsylvania governor and national Democratic chairman.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Southwest Airlines sued its mechanics’ union late Thursday for what the airline claimed was an illegal work slowdown that grounded planes and has resulted in as many as 100 flight cancellations a day since mid-February.

The carrier said its mechanics had taken an unusually high number of planes out of service in recent weeks, a move seen as a negotiating tactic in a contract dispute. Negotiations most recently broke down over how much maintenance the airline would be allowed to outsource.

Last month, mechanics pulled as many as 62 planes from service in one day, resulting in schedule disruptions across Southwest’s network, according to the lawsuit. By comparison, the airline said, it expects to have about 14 planes out of service on an average day, and can operate a normal schedule with as many as 35 grounded aircraft, out of a fleet of 752.

The mechanics, who are members of the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association, have cited safety concerns as the reason for taking the aircraft out of service. The airline argued in its suit that many of the planes had been taken out of commission for relatively minor issues that did not affect their ability to fly.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Three of the last four Indy 500s have been won by drivers with F1 experience: Juan Pablo Montoya, from Colombia, in 2015; Alexander Rossi, from California, in 2016; and Takuma Sato, from Japan, in 2017. Sato was one of four full-time former F1 drivers in the IndyCar Series that year; there were also three part-timers, including Montoya.

Sato, 42, drove in 90 F1 races from 2002 to 2008, finishing third in the U.S. Grand Prix, then at Indianapolis, and eighth in the 2004 standings with the Lucky Strike BAR Honda team. He moved to IndyCar in 2010 but won only once in 105 races before winning at the Indy 500.

“I know how tough the competition is there — it’s all about technology and science, and research and development. Unbelievable equipment, and I really enjoyed it,” Sato said of F1. “But what I’m doing now is completely concentrating on this series. I have no regrets. I’m completely happy with how I’ve done in the IndyCar Series.”

“Although as a racecar driver,” he added, “I’d very much like to drive Formula One.”

Ericsson said he enjoyed traveling around the world as an F1 driver, but he had been only to Austin and Los Angeles in the United States before he moved to Indianapolis this winter.

His manager for six years was Kenny Brack, a Swedish driver who won the championship of the former Indy Racing League in 1998 and the Indy 500 in 1999. Brack had been instrumental in Ericsson’s transition from go-karts to race in the Formula BMW Series in Britain in 2007.

Ericsson got more information about racing in North America from Brack and from Rossi, who moved to the IndyCar Series full time in 2016 from a part-time ride with the Marussia Formula One team. Rossi won the Indy 500 that year, only his sixth race in the series.

“Apart from F1, it’s the toughest level of racing at the moment,” Ericsson said. “You have to have some flexibility to drive. F1 is supercomplex, with high speeds in the corners. It’s all about perfection. With IndyCar, it’s an old-school feeling. You have to work behind the steering wheel to drive it.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Senator Sherrod Brown, the populist Ohio Democrat known for extolling the “dignity of work,” announced Thursday that he would not seek the Democratic nomination for president, ceding the primary field to other left-leaning candidates with broader national appeal.

His exit comes as better-known Democrats like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. prepare to announce their own plans for 2020, and as the field itself has swelled to 14 candidates, including fellow liberal senators like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.

Allies of Mr. Brown said on Thursday that his decision to forgo a 2020 bid had nothing to do with the signs that Mr. Biden is preparing to enter the race. Rather, they said, Mr. Brown ultimately resolved that he was content in the Senate and lacked the consuming drive to become president. And there were obvious practical obstacles to the 2020 nomination for a 66-year-old white man with a mix of liberal and moderate views and a relatively modest donor base. Indeed, for Mr. Brown, the popularity and fund-raising strength of Mr. Sanders, a fellow populist, were obstacles that were at least as big as any Mr. Biden might present.

[Why are so many Democrats bowing out of a 2020 campaign this week? Here are four reasons.]

Speaking to reporters between votes in the Capitol on Thursday, Mr. Brown quickly noted that he “didn’t have a lifelong ambition to be president.” Though he argued that there was a “path for me,” highlighting his progressive credentials, he said he felt tugged to remain in the Senate, a job he relishes more than some of his colleagues who covet the presidency.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Mick Mulvaney, who is now Mr. Trump’s acting chief of staff, acknowledged when he was being confirmed for his previous job as budget director, that he had paid back taxes of more than $15,000 for a household employee whose payroll taxes he had not paid.

Former Representative Tom Price of Georgia, who in 2017 resigned as health secretary for using expensive chartered flights, had to defend stock trades that might have been impacted by his time in Congress during his confirmation hearing. And Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, was scolded by senators before being confirmed for failing to disclose $95 million of real estate assets on this ethics questionnaire.

In 2009, Timothy Geithner, who was former President Barack Obama’s first Treasury secretary, came under fire from Republicans for failing to pay more than $40,000 in federal taxes.

But many Republican senators were not overly concerned with Mr. Moore’s finances on Thursday.

“Steve has the right intellect, the right philosophy and the right background,” said Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota, and a member of the banking committee. “I’m not concerned — unless there are piles and piles and piles of these. People have tax issues from time to time, especially people who have had as many career changes as he has.”

Senator Richard Shelby, a member of the banking committee, said he was not familiar with details of the case, but suggested that Mr. Moore should be subjected to a full review of his past dealings if and when Mr. Trump formally nominates him.

“Scrub him,” Mr. Shelby said. “People got to do the right thing — and I assume he did — but it’s got to be scrubbed.”

Allies of Mr. Moore said that a simple tax snafu should not raise questions about his ability to help steer the United States economy. Macroeconomics, they said, is a much different beast than the tax code.

“Being a tax accountant is very different than being a good tax economist,” said Arthur Laffer, a prominent supply-side economist who recently wrote a book with Mr. Moore. “He’s very good on tax economics.”</TEXT>

Francis Smith, an 83-year-old resident of East Harlem, stood at the end of a checkout counter at a local supermarket on Saturday, pulled out several plastic bags from her hand cart and began bagging her items.

A store employee helped her stuff paper towels into a worn, white plastic bag from Target that she had brought from home.

“I always carry extra plastic bags and never throw them away or waste any,” said Ms. Smith. “I understand that they do harm to the environment, but these ‘single-use’ bags can be used a lot.”

Her reaction, and many like it, came after New York lawmakers agreed last week to impose a statewide ban on single-use plastic bags from most retail sales. The plan was included in the state’s $175 billion budget that was announced early Sunday.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>It’s time for some big museum to summon its nerve, take off its blinkers and account for the rash of representational and specifically figurative painting going on right now. Jonathan Gardner’s impressive second New York solo show is one of numerous cases in point. The stylish, stylized paintings in “Desert Wind” are wry, lush and pleasurable in their beauty and their brains. With figures who recline, make love or smoke a hookah in luxurious interiors or hidden gardens, Mr. Gardner’s subject may be reverie or maybe indolence, solitary or not, clothed or nude, at home, but mostly, it seems, abroad. Perhaps he intends these quiet carefree scenes to distract us from how carefully he engineers every composition. If so, he succeeds: It takes a while to understand their formal complexity.

The new works improve on those in Mr. Gardner’s first solo show, also at this gallery, in 2016. The art references have become more subtle. A table leg evokes Brancusi; a red rug may allude to Donald Judd’s early reliefs. Equally important: Pictorial space is now carefully controlled — and mostly flattened out of existence. The compositions present nearly solid fronts of rectilinear elements that push forward, regardless of whether they define tiled floor, wood-grain table tops, a garden wall, or another scene that could be the view from a picture window or a painting within a painting.

Mr. Gardner’s engineering grants each element as much autonomy as possible. Plated food and grouped objects form small, independent still lifes. In “Visions of the Emerald Beyond,” a bright orange striped textile has the punch of an abstract painting, even if a woman in a lavender bikini bottom reclines on it. The waiters’ blue jackets in “The Waiter” and “The Ballroom” have deeper-blue shadows that evoke clouds in a night sky. All the paintings’ parts are kept in check, just this side of mutiny.

      <TEXT>A new-model airliner crashes, killing all 189 people aboard. Less than five months later, another airliner of the same new model crashes, killing all 157 aboard. Both seem to have occurred under similar circumstances. The world was understandably terrified, and until Wednesday, the United States Federal Aviation Administration stood alone as the only major aviation safety agency that had not ordered the grounding of this airline model, Boeing’s 737 Max 8.

President Trump’s executive order on Wednesday afternoon to ground all Boeing 737 Max 8s was a necessary step. But it is a step that should have been taken directly by the federal agency responsible for aviation safety. That it came from the White House instead speaks to a profound crisis of public confidence in the F.A.A.

The roots of this crisis can be found in a major change the agency instituted in its regulatory responsibility in 2005. Rather than naming and supervising its own “designated airworthiness representatives,” the agency decided to allow Boeing and other manufacturers who qualified under the revised procedures to select their own employees to certify the safety of their aircraft. In justifying this change, the agency said at the time that it would save the aviation industry about $25 billion from 2006 to 2015. Therefore, the manufacturer is providing safety oversight of itself. This is a worrying move toward industry self-certification.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>As a mature black woman, I beg to differ with “Michelle Obama’s Rules of Assimilation,” by Erin Aubry Kaplan (Op-Ed, Feb. 25), about Mrs. Obama’s biography, “Becoming.” Ms. Kaplan writes, “Once again,” black people “are denied our fullness.”

But “Becoming” is Mrs. Obama’s story — not that of all of black America! It’s unfortunate that in this country we have so few public people of color to look up to. Because of the dearth, we lay a burden far too heavy on those few shoulders.

It’s time for each person of color to tell his or her story. My story certainly has some similarities to Mrs. Obama’s (the emphasis on education), yet it is also different.

The answer to racism and bigotry is the realization that we are all unique, that though there are places where our stories merge, our journeys are also different. The appreciation of differences is what is really important.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>And yet the city’s public schools — the nation’s largest system — were closed for a snow day.

How did that happen?

Timing. He had to make a decision Sunday evening, when the forecast looked ominous. The weather changed overnight, but by that point, it was too late to adjust the plan.

The call to close schools is made early, “with as much time as possible for parents to plan,” the mayor’s spokesman said. Then there are all the school buses to think about.

As my colleagues Eliza Shapiro and Michael Gold wrote, buses leave depots before dawn and could interfere with the nearly 1,600 snow plows combing the streets.

How many snow days have there been in New York City?

Seven since 2014, compared with 11 from 1978 to 2013, according to The City’s Alyssa Katz.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>When a terrorist massacred 50 people at two New Zealand mosques last week, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern immediately grasped the nettle. “I can tell you one thing right now,” she told a news conference. “Our gun laws will change.”

That’s what effective leadership looks like. New Zealand’s cabinet has now agreed in principle to overhaul those laws, experts are reviewing ways to make the country safer from firearms and, Ardern promised, “within 10 days of this horrific act of terrorism, we will have announced reforms.”

Contrast that with the United States, where just since 1970, more Americans have died from guns (1.45 million, including murders, suicides and accidents) than died in all the wars in American history (1.4 million). More Americans die from guns every 10 weeks than died in the entire Afghanistan and Iraq wars combined, yet we still don’t have gun safety rules as rigorous as New Zealand’s even before the mosques were attacked.

The N.R.A. (not to be confused with the vast majority of gun owners) will turn to its old smoke-and-mirrors standby, arguing that the killer’s hate, not his guns and bullets, were the real problem.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Good Thursday morning. Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today.
• The Federal Reserve updated its 2019 economic projections and expressed increasing concern about slowing growth as it left interest rates unchanged. The fairly downbeat assessment is at odds with the White House’s rosy projections, which predict much stronger growth than many say is likely.
• Two years ago, some of America’s largest corporations were tearing up their business plans to accommodate President Trump, fearful that he could send their shareholders and customers fleeing with a tweet. Now they have a new strategy: ignoring him.
• Mr. Trump has been unable to shake his grudge against Senator John McCain, who died in August of brain cancer. The president made that clear in front of a military audience at a tank plant, saying that he had given Mr. McCain “the funeral he wanted, and I didn’t get ‘thank you.’”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Late on Saturday morning, Nadal texted his friendly rival Federer to let him know that he would not be able to play.

“For me, it’s not about only today,” Nadal said. “It’s about what it means for me to have to pull out in a tournament that I love so much like this one, and in the semifinals after playing well during the whole tournament. You can imagine that I can’t be happy.”

Nadal also announced his withdrawal from the Miami Open, which begins next week and is one of the few significant events he has not won. His decision not to play on Saturday was also made with the goal of preserving his clay-court season. An 11-time French Open singles champion and the most successful clay-court player ever, Nadal said he fully expected to be ready to play on clay in Monte Carlo next month.

Federer, 37, appeared in the stadium after the Thiem-Raonic match to give an on-court interview for the fans. Nadal leads their rivalry, 23-15, but Federer has won five straight, most recently in the final of the Shanghai Masters in 2017.

“We’ve had so many epic battles, and yes, I know that everyone we have now could be our last,” Federer said. “So was this our chance for the last one? I really hope not, and I really believe at the level he’s playing and I’m still going, there are definitely going to be more.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>In late 2015, The New York Times released the NYT VR app and published the Magazine cover story “Displaced,” a multimedia journey in text, photographs and virtual reality that tells the stories of three child refugees.

Since then, The Times has published dozens of films that use V.R. technology on topics including exploring Antarctica and Pluto, civil rights issues and the Hiroshima bombing. The Times has also begun experimenting with A.R., augmented reality, which doesn’t require the app.

To help us provide teachers with practical teaching strategies on using NYT VR in the classroom, we’ve teamed up with Travis Feldler, founder of TechRow Fund, a nonprofit organization that explores how to leverage immersive technology inside schools to improve learning outcomes. This post is part of a series of guest lessons we occasionally publish featuring partnerships with outside organizations who make especially good use of New York Times materials in their programming and curriculums.

Virtual reality journalism, a medium that enables journalists to tell stories through an immersive, 360-degree audiovisual experience, can serve as a powerful educational tool to grab students’ attention and get them excited about a range of complex subjects. The V.R. experiences created by The New York Times combine the power of immersion with compelling first-person narratives and storytelling to allow users to explore a range of scientific, cultural and global themes. After students don their headsets, they enter a new environment — from Ethiopia and Mecca to a March for Our Lives protest and CERN’s Large Hadron Collider — in which their senses of sight and sound are totally engaged.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Ted Lindsay, a Hall of Fame player who packed a fierce combativeness in a slight frame as he helped the Detroit Red Wings win four Stanley Cup championship titles, died on Monday at his home in Oakland Township, Mich. He was 93.

Lew LaPaugh, a son-in-law and the president of the Ted Lindsay Foundation, which raises money for autism research, confirmed the death.

Lindsay, nicknamed Terrible Ted, played 17 seasons in the National Hockey League, 14 of them with the Red Wings, coming out of retirement for the final one. He was the first N.H.L. player to play 1,000 games, a first-team All Star eight times and a participant in 11 All-Star games. The Red Wings named him their captain.

Lindsay could be scrappy off the ice as well. In the mid-1950s he led an initially unsuccessful effort to create a players’ union, for which he paid a price.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>MARX My mom did everything herself because it was easier and she liked things done a certain way. Once she went away for a week and my father relied so much on her that she put name tags on my father’s clothes that said things like, “Wear with khaki pants Thursday.”

CHAST My mother was the one who made all the decisions and ran the show. My father never learned to how to drive because it made him profoundly anxious, so she did all the driving, even though she was an anxious driver, but it was a different sort of anxiety. My father didn't want to do anything. I think he would have been happy staying in the apartment, puttering around and reading the Times.

MARX My mother was very blunt. We grew up before they invented psychology. So my mother felt free to criticize without thinking there would be horrible consequences. She called it constructive criticism and I valued it because I knew she was telling the truth. She once read a piece of mine in Time magazine, and said, “Guess what? I hate it! But if enough people like it, I’ll change my mind,” which I completely understood.

CHAST My mother never offered that many opinions about my work, though sometimes she would get mad and say, “You’re using me and daddy to make fun of.” I’d say, “This is a general statement about, um …”

MARX And she bought that?

Would you both say that your childhoods were the gift that keeps on giving, workwise?

MARX Unlike Roz, I had a really good childhood. I learned the word bourgeois so I could say, “You are so bourgeois!” to my parents, because I was a Communist. A Communist in the suburbs. I envy you your worst childhood.

CHAST My parents didn’t try and make it bad. They were working all the time. My mother had this idea that if I ever socialized with other kids at the very best I would come home with impetigo and at the worst I would be learning things I shouldn’t be learning. So my childhood was about avoiding other children. It was like being locked in a Skinner box.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>As investigators closed in on Purdue Pharma, the maker of the opioid painkiller OxyContin, more than a decade ago, members of the family that owns the company began shifting hundreds of millions of dollars from the business to themselves through offshore entities, the state of New York alleged in a lawsuit on Thursday.

The legal complaint, released at a news conference by the state attorney general Letitia James, was heavily redacted. Even so, it contains striking details alleging systematic fraud not only by the Sacklers but by a group of large but lesser-known companies that distributed alarming amounts of prescription painkillers amid a rising epidemic of abuse that has killed hundreds of thousands of people nationwide.

The major pharmaceutical distributors — Cardinal Health, McKesson and Amerisource Bergen — warned pharmacies when their monthly opioid limits were approaching, then helped them manipulate the timing and volume of orders to circumvent the limits, the complaint charged. On the rare occasion when a distributor would conduct “surprise” audits of its customers, it would often alert them in advance, the complaint says.

Over the past two decades, more than 200,000 people have died in the United States from overdoses involving prescription opioids, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 200,000 more have died from overdoses involving illegal opioids, like heroin.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The United States Senate voted on Wednesday to confirm Neomi Rao, President Trump’s nominee to replace Brett M. Kavanaugh on a key appeals court, bringing the president closer to his goal of putting his stamp firmly on the federal judiciary.

Ms. Rao, the administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, was confirmed by a vote of 53 to 46 for a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, a frequent steppingstone to the Supreme Court.

A former law professor and clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas, Ms. Rao was seen as an ally in the president’s push for deregulation and had the backing of the Federalist Society, the powerful conservative legal group.

Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, praised Ms. Rao when the committee moved her nomination forward earlier this month.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is in a state of crisis.

Deterioration of service is apparent. Ridership is down and public misery is up. The unacceptable condition of the system is having a negative effect on the city and state economies. It is difficult to imagine how the public transportation network will accommodate the hundreds of thousands of people expected to enter the regional work force over the next 20 years with a system that already delivers an average of 5.6 million rides each weekday.

Most everyone agrees on these facts, but there is no consensus on what to do about that.

Lately, the political debate is focused on the money, and in particular, on a congestion-pricing proposal put forth by Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio , which, if adopted, would not cover all of the funding gaps.

Thus, despite the best efforts of those who support congestion pricing, how to properly fund the M.T.A. remains a vexing question. But getting the M.T.A. out of its crisis will also require significant changes in two other related areas: governance and management.

The M.T.A. was created in 1968 to bring together the underfunded and poorly maintained transit systems of New York City and its region. The authorizing statute established very clearly that the chairman of the board of the M.T.A., while appointed by the governor, should be an independent chief executive officer. The heads of each agency under the M.T.A. umbrella — for example, New York’s subway authority and the suburban train lines — would report to the board chairman .</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Rafael Eitan was born on Nov. 23, 1926, in the British Mandate of Palestine to Zionists who had immigrated from Russia three years earlier and lived in a small settlement near Tel Aviv. Not yet a teenager, Rafi joined the Haganah, the forerunner of the Israeli Army, to defend the settlement against Arab attacks and was later recruited into its more elite branch, the Palmach.

With Jews pressing the British for an autonomous homeland, his most dazzling venture was to crawl through sewers to blow up a British radar installation on Mount Carmel. It earned him the sobriquet “Rafi the Smelly,” to distinguish him from another Rafael Eitan, who went on to become chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces. Mr. Eitan also played an important role in smuggling Jewish refugees from Nazism into Palestine.

Mr. Eitan was twice wounded in the 1948 war for independence. After telling his superiors that it was difficult for him to run in the field, they assigned him to an intelligence unit. His spying career had begun, though he took time to earn a degree from the London School of Economics.

Over the next few decades he served as operations chief at Shin Bet, Israel’s equivalent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and as Mossad’s deputy operations chief. In 1965, posing as an Israeli government chemist, he visited a nuclear fuel plant in Apollo, Pa., outside Pittsburgh. It was later discovered that a large quantity of enriched uranium had vanished. Though the case has never been solved, some American analysts concluded that it was more than a coincidence that Mr. Eitan’s visit had occurred around the time of the disappearance.

In 1985, Mr. Pollard, an intelligence analyst for the Navy assigned to monitor classified materials on global terrorist activities, was arrested on charges of spying for Israel and turning over thousands of documents to it. He confessed and was sentenced to life imprisonment. After serving 30 years, Mr. Pollard, now 64, was granted parole and released from prison in 2015.

The Pollard affair strained the close ties between the United States and Israel and raised the specter of divided loyalties among some American Jews — though today, after revelations in 2013 of the United States spying on allies through the National Security Agency, the double-dealing seems routine.

Israeli officials at first tried to depict the Pollard case as a rogue operation by Mossad. But Shimon Peres, Israel’s prime minister at the time, publicly apologized and allowed State Department officials to question Mr. Eitan, who had been the adviser on terrorism to a previous prime minister, Menachem Begin, and had overseen Mr. Pollard’s spying. Mr. Eitan later told journalists that he had acted with “permission and authority.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>So far, however, there has been no missile on the launchpad at Sohae.

At the State Department, the senior administration official said the United States had not concluded whether North Korea was intending to conduct a launch. But that would amount to backsliding on commitments made to Mr. Trump, the official told reporters in a briefing, where he insisted on anonymity to discuss the sensitive diplomacy.

In fact, Mr. Kim appears to have backtracked on several of those commitments. Sohae was never dismantled, and inspectors were never allowed in.

Similarly, North Korean officials told Secretary of State Mike Pompeo during a visit to Pyongyang last fall that they would allow international inspectors into a nuclear testing site that they said had been sealed after its entrances were blown up. The inspectors have never been permitted into the country.

While Mr. Trump and his staff have done everything they can to avoid directly criticizing Mr. Kim or imperiling negotiations, administration officials said they knew it would be impossible to ignore, or explain away, a space mission.

When Iran recently tried to launch its own satellite, the State Department issued a series of strongly worded warnings to Tehran. The mission failed, and there was some speculation about whether that failure was the result of an American-led sabotage program. The United States ran a similar program during the Obama administration against North Korea.

Mr. Trump’s comments on North Korea were considerably softer than the warnings to Iran — a reflection of the care he takes not to alienate Mr. Kim.

But Mr. Kim never made any written commitments to dismantle the sites or give access to inspectors. North Korean officials also have argued that the United States has failed in its commitments to take steps to improve the relationship between the two countries, starting with the lifting of the most effective sanctions on its imports and exports.</TEXT>

That reminds me: I have to pay my dog walker. She only accepts Venmo, and it’s so much easier than having to remember to have enough CASH on hand.

30A: A three-letter entry for “When repeated, start of a cheer” could be RAH, but that eastern section was pretty easy to figure out, and so it was no issue to get HIP, as in “HIP, HIP, hooray!”

41A: Fun clue. When you move the “E” in EAT to the end of the word, you get the past tense, “ate.”

64A: “Aussies with deep pockets?” are ROOS. Not rich Australians.</TEXT>

More details and stories of heroism are emerging from the terrorist attack that left 50 people dead at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. Abdul Aziz was in one of the mosques when he heard gunshots. Rather than turning from the sound, he ran toward it in an effort to distract the attacker.

Some at the mosques had come from places scarred by war, while others had grown up in Christchurch. But worshipers of all kinds came together to seek answers at the hospital, where the fate of loved ones was still unknown. Above, a vigil outside the Botanic Gardens in Christchurch.

Within hours of the attacks, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern promised gun control reform. But the issue could be divisive in New Zealand, where an extraordinary number of people own weapons, with few restrictions.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>NAHAL OZ, Israel — Tens of thousands of Palestinians returned to the borderland between Gaza and Israel on Saturday for a largely peaceful protest marking the first anniversary of demonstrations that have frequently led to violent clashes with Israeli troops.

Despite efforts by both sides to minimize casualties, hundreds of protesters rushed the fence, some hurling homemade bombs, and three were killed.

After a round of violence on Monday that began when a rocket fired from Gaza wounded several Israelis north of Tel Aviv and ended after Israel spent a day pounding targets in Gaza, neither side was eager for a new war, least of all Israel, which is 10 days away from elections.

Egyptian intermediaries worked with both sides to keep the situation from boiling over, and Hamas, the militant Islamic group that controls Gaza, deployed scores of people in orange vests to keep most demonstrators at least 300 yards from the fence, the distance Israel had demanded as a buffer.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>For three decades, bright orange novelty phones shaped like the cartoon cat Garfield kept washing up on the shoreline of Brittany, in western France. Nobody knew where they came from, until now.

Volunteers cleaning the beaches last week discovered a long-lost shipping container in a craggy nook. Because of rising tides, the sea cave is accessible only a few days each year. Once advertised by Tyco as “real phones for real fun,” they are now mostly a real nuisance along the Brittany coast.

      <TEXT>In the flickering light of the boxy old television, Álvaro lays out his case with the painstaking logic of a person who doesn’t expect to be believed: Something is deeply, strangely suspect about the Season 2 opener of “The X-Files,” the episode in which Mulder goes to Puerto Rico to investigate an alien conspiracy.

For starters, there’s the vegetation, which looks exactly nothing like Puerto Rico and a whole lot like California. And then there is the supposedly Puerto Rican character Mulder encounters, who seems distinctly Mexican.

It’s a funny monologue, ingeniously layered and shadowed with pain. In Jorge Ignacio Cortiñas’s “Recent Alien Abductions” — a play that examines the many meanings of “alien” — it is a kind of show within the show, touching on cultural dominion and the caprices of memory, but also on trauma and erasure, both personal and sociopolitical.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>MAASTRICHT, the Netherlands — Tefaf, one of the world’s most opulent art fairs, held every year in the southern Netherlands town of Maastricht, offers an encyclopedic array of paintings, sculpture, antiques and antiquities, presented in custom booths designed as mini-museums. This year’s showcase takes place at the Maastricht Exhibition and Congress Center from Saturday to March 24, decorated, as usual, with wall-to-wall carpeting and thousands of tulips.

Because it was originally organized by a group of dealers, who wanted to remain exclusive, Tefaf Maastricht has often seemed like a closed circuit to many art dealers. Those who took part were almost always invited to return, leaving very little room for new exhibitors. Even very successful newer galleries didn’t bother to apply, sure that they wouldn’t stand a chance.

When he became the new chief executive of Tefaf Maastricht in 2015, Patrick van Maris said one of his primary objectives was to make the application process for the Maastricht fair more transparent, to encourage new applicants and to bring in fresh blood. This year, for the first time, visitors will start to see the results of that process, as 40 new dealers replace some longtime participants — about a 15 percent turnover in a showcase of 279 exhibitors.

The greatest change is taking place in the Tefaf Modern section, which welcomes 14 new galleries, including international heavy-hitters such as Pace Gallery from New York; Galerie Gmurzynska, based in Zurich; Germany’s Sprüth Magers; and Simon Lee from London.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>They shared photos of water rushing over riverbanks and encircling homes and neighborhoods.

Floodwaters had surrounded the town of Fremont, Neb., about 40 miles northwest of Omaha, said Councilwoman Linda McClain. The town sits between the Platte River to the south and the Elkhorn River to the north. Both rivers had overflowed their banks, Ms. McClain said.

“We’re like an island,” she said. “You cannot get in or out.”

Ms. McClain said she spent Saturday visiting shelters where people who had been displaced were congregating. About 75 people had been reluctant to leave their homes, but as the buildings took on water, they were rescued by airboats and taken to the shelters, she said. Many homes were flooded by as much as three or four feet of water.

Parts of the city had been under a mandatory evacuation.

“Right now, we’re in crisis mode,” she said.

Tech. Sgt. Rachelle Blake, of the United States Air Force, said several buildings on the Offutt Air Force Base, which is south of Omaha, had been evacuated as water from Papillion Creek, a tributary of the Missouri River, flooded the southeast part of the base. She said the northwest part of the base was largely unaffected.

She said that it was too soon to quantify the damage, but that buildings and hangars were underwater. Aircraft had previously been moved to higher ground.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“More to Fear for Yeshiva Students” (editorial, March 8) is critical of the Orthodox Jewish community. Its allusions to politics, lobbyists and other tropes are a diversion from the troubling new State Education Department guidelines that are its subject.

Those guidelines dictate what classes private schools, including yeshivas, must teach, how and for how long they must be taught and even who can teach private school students. That is why they are being challenged by every sector of New York’s private school community.

Decades ago, the New York Court of Appeals struck down a less invasive effort by the state’s Education Department to regulate private schools, declaring that “ it would b e int olerable ... to hand over to any official or group of officials an unlimited and undefined power to make such regulations.”

Nothing has occurred in the intervening years to empower the state to impose invasive mandates on private schools.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The link between statin use and the development of Type 2 diabetes may be even stronger than previously believed, a new study suggests.

Researchers prospectively studied 8,567 men and women whose average age was 64. All were free of diabetes and not taking statins when the study started.

In a follow-up of up to 15 years, about 12 percent of the group started taking statins, most using either Zocor or Lipitor (simvastatin or atorvastatin) and the rest either Pravachol or Lescol (pravastatin or fluvastatin). Most took them for more than a year, and there were 716 new cases of diabetes in the group.

After controlling for age, sex, smoking, family history of diabetes and many other factors, they found that statin use was associated with higher risk for insulin resistance and high blood sugar, and with a 38 percent increased risk for the development of Type 2 diabetes. The brand of statin and the dosage made no difference, but the risk was especially high in statin users who were overweight or obese. The study was in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The news is the latest sign of the changing climate in the art world toward the Sacklers, who are major donors to museums. Family members own Purdue Pharma, which makes the painkiller OxyContin and is facing hundreds of lawsuits as a result of the epidemic of opioid addiction.

Tate’s statement came two days after Britain’s National Portrait Gallery said it would not accept a long-discussed $1.3 million donation from the London-based Sackler Trust, one of the family’s charitable foundations. It said the decision was taken jointly by the gallery and Trust.

But the Thursday announcement, affecting Tate Modern and Tate Britain in London, as well as Tate Liverpool and Tate St. Ives in Cornwall, could have a bigger impact in the art world. All these galleries are major tourist attractions as well as home to large, high-profile exhibitions.

In an email, a spokesman for the Mortimer and Raymond Sackler family said, “We deeply sympathise with all the communities, families and individuals affected by the addiction crisis in America. The allegations made against family members in relation to this are strongly denied and will be vigorously defended in court.” He did not comment on Tate’s decision.

Much of the focus on the Sacklers’ donations to art institutions has been in the United States, where deaths and addiction associated with prescription opioids have become an unrelenting crisis. But awareness of the crisis is high in Britain, and that has led to pressure on galleries, with the news media asking frequent questions about donations from the Sacklers.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>From the Mueller report to the Affordable Care Act, it’s been a busy week in American politics. Here are some of the biggest stories you might have missed (and some links if you’d like to read further).

The investigation led by Robert S. Mueller III found that neither President Trump nor any of his aides conspired or coordinated with the Russian government’s 2016 election interference.

Mr. Mueller also reached no conclusion on the charge of obstruction of justice, writing that “while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.” So in a letter to Congress, Attorney General William P. Barr pronounced the president clear of committing any criminal offense. (Read Mr. Barr’s four-page summary of the report here.)

Democrats have become skeptical of the summary for a couple of reasons: They’re portraying Mr. Barr’s decision as a hasty, dubious intervention on behalf of the president who installed him and are wondering how a 300-page document could have been summarized in just four.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Pakistan has made those promises before, including when it was put on the financial task force’s so-called gray list early last year, at the request of the Trump administration.

But Pakistani officials say that there is greater urgency now, and that Mr. Khan’s administration is worried about becoming an international pariah if it fails to act. On Monday evening, Mr. Khan gave a rare background briefing to news show hosts in which he reportedly emphasized that the time had come to do more to crack down on militant groups.

Pakistani officials say they plan to freeze the assets of more groups, and to take control of religious seminaries that are affiliated with them. The officials said that more travel restrictions would also be imposed on militant leaders.

In an initial sign of a crackdown, the Pakistani authorities have detained 44 people, including the brother and son of Masood Azhar, the chief of Jaish-e-Muhammad. Shehryar Afridi, the state minister for interior, who announced the move during a news conference in Islamabad, did not specify any charges and said the detentions were meant for investigations.

Mr. Afridi said the names of Mufti Abdur Raoof, the brother of Mr. Azhar, and Hammad Azhar, the son of Mr. Azhar, were included in a dossier that Indian authorities handed to Pakistan for investigations into the Feb. 14 Kashmir attack.

Azam Suleman Khan, the interior secretary, said those detained would be freed if found innocent. “In case we don’t find any evidence against them, we will release them,” Mr. Khan said.

As Pakistan continued to extend gestures that it wanted normalization of ties, its Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that Sohail Mehmood, the country’s ambassador to India, would return to New Delhi to resume his duties. The ambassador was recalled to Islamabad last month after tensions erupted over the Kashmir attack.

Pakistan also said on Tuesday that a delegation would visit India on March 14 to discuss a draft agreement on a Sikh pilgrimage corridor between the estranged neighbors. The Pakistani visit will be followed by a reciprocal Indian visit, officials said.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>In 2005, Congress passed the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which restricts lawsuits against gun sellers and makers by granting industrywide immunity from blame when one of their products is used in a crime. Lawmakers behind the measure cited a need to foil what they described as predatory and politically driven litigation.

The law does allow exceptions for sale and marketing practices that violate state or federal laws and instances of so-called negligent entrustment, in which a gun is carelessly given or sold to a person posing a high risk of misusing it. The families pushed to broaden the scope to include the manufacturer, Remington, which was named in the suit, along with a wholesaler and a local retailer.

The lawsuit said that the companies were wrong to entrust an untrained civilian public with a weapon designed for maximizing fatalities on the battlefield. Lawyers pointed out advertising — with messages of combat dominance and hyper-masculinity — that resonated with disturbed young men who could be induced to use the weapon to commit violence.

“Remington may never have known Adam Lanza, but they had been courting him for years,” Mr. Koskoff, one of the lawyers representing the families, told the panel of judges during oral arguments in the case in 2017. The weapon used by Mr. Lanza had been legally purchased by his mother, Nancy Lanza, whom he also killed.

Lawyers representing the gun companies argued that the claims raised in the lawsuit were specifically the kind that federal law inoculated them against. In oral arguments, lawyers for the companies argued that the weapons were marketed as being used for home defense and target practice, and not to commit violence.

They said that agreeing with the families’ arguments would require amending the law or ignoring how it had been applied in the past.

James B. Vogts, a lawyer for Remington, said in court that the shooting “was a tragedy that cannot be forgotten.”

“But no matter how tragic,” he added, “no matter how much we wish those children and their teachers were not lost and those damages not suffered, the law needs to be applied dispassionately.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand — Lamenting that “the world has been stuck in a vicious cycle of extremism breeding extremism,” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand said at a national memorial service for the Christchurch attack victims on Friday that the dangerous cycle “must end.”

Ms. Ardern’s call for a collective global response to violence and terrorism — based in “our humanity” — came two weeks after a gunman killed 50 worshipers in attacks on two mosques in the city.

Her speech reflected questions that New Zealanders have been wrestling with as the shock of the attack has begun to fade: namely, how deeply extremist sentiments have taken root in the country, and how to prevent such violence from happening again.

“The ugliest of viruses can exist in places they are not welcome,” Ms. Ardern said, adding that racism, violence, extremism and assaults on freedom of worship were “not welcome here.”</TEXT>

ALBANY — A handful of the nation’s leading left-leaning Democrats, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, have picked a fight with an unexpected opponent: the New York State Democratic Party.

They are fighting over an arcane, but critical, aspect of New York’s election laws that gives small parties the ability to wield significant influence in state politics.

The practice, known as fusion voting, allows small political parties to cross-endorse major candidates, which has enabled organizations like the Working Families Party to become a darling of the progressive left and a growing irritant to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.

The State Democratic Party on Monday passed a resolution to get rid of fusion voting. New York is only one of a small handful of states that allow it.</TEXT>

“My camera was a reason to explore more, walk more, observe more and learn more about the city,” he said, “and specially about East London.” He also honed his craft as he peeled back East London’s layers. He discovered that the East End’s angles and architecture made magic with light and shadow, and that its colors and multiculturalism offered a trove of artistic possibilities.

More than five years and thousands of images later, “Documenting East London” reveals his part of the city and his confident visual style. The play of light and shadow and the highlighting of single images within a frame make his photos look almost like oil paintings.

      <TEXT>People around the country — and the world — are waiting for the report on President Trump by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, to finally be released so that we can all understand how, or whether, Vladimir Putin is responsible for the fact that we have a president who can’t spell “hamburger.”

Democrats running in 2020 want the report. Newsrooms around the world hope we actually get to see it. But no one is waiting more impatiently on that report than … Mom. She’s newly obsessed with politics the way everyone was newly obsessed with kale a few years ago. She gets on the phone to say “I just can’t watch the news anymore” and in the same breath recites all of last week’s “Meet the Press.”

Her love of gossip, judgment and reading makes her the most eager audience for Mr. Mueller. But she’s not just sitting around playing Words With Friends and liking Facebook posts until that big (possible!) obstruction-of-justice bombshell drops. She’s waiting on a litany of other equally important reports.

      <TEXT>49D: Isn’t butterscotch more of a tan/brown color? I have never thought of it as ORANGE, but maybe I just see it differently.

Before we discuss the theme, I’m told that Across Lite might not be able to handle the entry of this theme if you use the intended symbol, but it will accept the answer if you type out the word or the first letter of that word.

Mr. Adams offers us a set of three films that have right slashes in their titles, such as “FROST/NIXON,” and their crossers (while not films) have slashes as well. All of this is neatly tied up by the revealer at 25D, SLASHER FILM, which is normally a phrase that describes a movie with a lot of carnage in it.

As Mr. Adams notes below, I was a bit concerned by the entry 7D, HE/SHE and its cluing, but I was excited that there might be a possibility that the crossers for these film titles related back to them. For example, the theme entry at 17A is “VICTOR/VICTORIA,” which, on its surface, is about Julie Andrews’s character cross-dressing to get a job, but is really a look at the spectrum of queerness.

Alas, they’re not all related, but they all work on their own.

This is my second New York Times puzzle, and it was made about the same time my first one was published. And like that puzzle, this one uses left/right symmetry because of the lengths of the theme answers. But as an indie constructor, I enjoy doing unconventional things to get themes to work, and I’m always pleased when they do. The hardest part of this one, by far, was fitting in the FACE/OFF entry. Because it’s an even-length answer, I couldn’t run it horizontally, so it had to go in the center column. And the left/right symmetry meant having two answers of (at minimum) eight letters flank it and intersect with whatever entry went through the slash. It took a lot of trial and error to get it to work, but I’m pleased with the result. That said, the shape of the center largely forced the rest of the grid, including making 7D six spaces long. (More on this in a bit.) I could have broken up the top two rows into three answers each, but I try to avoid too many shorter answers when possible, and I’m pleased with how these corners came out. And yet, I am a bit conflicted about 7D, HE/SHE. As clued, it’s a perfectly reasonable answer in that it is unquestionably a third-person pronoun. Many people will see no problem with this clue/answer combo and will move on without a second thought. But others won’t. I, for one, had some reservations about it then, and I don’t think I’d use this answer if I were making this puzzle today. When the puzzle was accepted, Will and his team agreed with me that this was a clue to handle delicately. After all, these pronouns are restrictive and needlessly exclude nonbinary people, and have largely been supplanted by the singular “they” anyway. There was a fair bit of discussion about how to address such concerns without writing a clue that was awkwardly worded or overly wordy, or that called too much attention to the answer. In the end, we agreed that, as written, the clue would work best for the previously mentioned reason: It works without distracting from the rest of the puzzle. Still, even though this issue is not addressed in the clue, I’m glad Will and his team took the time to discuss it carefully and to consider multiple viewpoints and suggestions.

Almost finished solving but need a bit more help? We’ve got you covered.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>KINSHASA, Democratic Republic of Congo — The new Congolese president, Felix Tshisekedi, has pardoned about 700 political prisoners who were jailed under his predecessor.

Mr. Tshisekedi signed the decree Wednesday, fulfilling a promise he made this month to do so during his first 100 days in office.

Among those set for release was Firmin Yangambi, who was sentenced in 2009 to 20 years in prison on charges of being a threat to national security. Also being freed is Franck Diongo, an opposition figure who was sentenced to five years imprisonment during the previous administration.

Mr. Tshisekedi was declared the winner of the Dec. 30 presidential election, leading Congo to its first peaceful transfer of power since independence from Belgium nearly 60 years ago. He succeeded Joseph Kabila, who governed the largely impoverished but mineral-rich country for 18 years.</TEXT>

Officials are wondering if they missed something about the 28-year-old Australian who is said to have attacked two mosques in Christchurch on Friday, leaving at least 50 people dead. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern ordered an inquiry into whether government agencies could have prevented the attacks.

Her cabinet also agreed “in principle” to overhaul the country’s gun laws and will announce reforms “within 10 days of this horrific act of terrorism,” she said at a news conference. Above, students from across Christchurch gathered for a memorial near one of the mosques.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WASHINGTON — The article was published without any great fanfare last week. “Trump’s Big Trade Opening” was the headline of the op-ed piece in The Wall Street Journal, which outlined how President Trump had created opportunities to advance free trade “more consequentially than his recent predecessors.”

More surprising than the content of a pro-Trump opinion column by a former administration official was the byline on it. The piece was written by Rob Porter, who resigned as the White House staff secretary in February 2018 amid domestic abuse accusations from both of his former wives. The Journal did not mention the circumstances that led to Mr. Porter’s departure.

Mr. Porter, who still lives in Washington and had been one of Mr. Trump’s most influential aides, has stayed out of the public eye since his resignation. Some saw his op-ed article as a first step toward re-entering the public arena after a year in the shadows.

But a response published on Thursday in The Washington Post by one of Mr. Porter’s former wives was the latest reminder that in the era of the #MeToo movement, a quiet comeback is complicated and a simple timeout, for many, is not viewed as enough.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>MOSCOW — President Vladimir V. Putin on Monday formally suspended Russia’s observance of a key nuclear arms treaty that the United States withdrew from last month, setting the stage for the return of a long-banned class of weapons.

The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, signed in 1987 in the waning years of the Cold War, had prohibited land-based missiles with relatively short ranges of 300 to 3,400 miles. Because of their quick flight times, such missiles were seen as a hair trigger for nuclear war.

The United States has for years accused Russia of violating the treaty by understating the range of one of its truck-launched missiles. The Obama administration pressed the issue during the crisis over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and President Trump cited it when he announced the United States’ decision to withdraw.

Mr. Trump also pointed out that China, which was never a party to the treaty, has been free to amass its own arsenal of the missiles.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I don’t think it’s a nightmare. For the Asia One project, I visited all these logistics companies, and I even went to workers’ homes. They all understand that they have to endure difficult living conditions. In China, it’s normal. Even if you work in a restaurant or a hotel, it’s the same: every day, you repeat the same actions.

How has China changed since the light bulb film?

China has changed a lot. Everybody can see it. It’s stronger and stronger, and more powerful. They have the power to have trade wars with America. All these international companies want to come to China, because the market is big here.

For the country, it’s more and more challenging. Because they’re stronger, they have more and more responsibility. So let’s see how China plays this role.

My father is 85 years old. He was born in 1933, before the new China, and he has seen a lot of changes in China. He always says to me that any one of us is just a tiny dot in these big waves of history. We’re like nothing, like a very small point. So we have to try not to get affected.

Do you think you will ever make work about a different reality than China?

Maybe, yes. Sometimes I think about making a movie in New York or in another city, because when I stay in other cities, I have ideas. I think emotion is the same. That’s why your work can go to different countries, and people like it and they want to know it.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>About seven years ago, three researchers at the University of Toronto built a system that could analyze thousands of photos and teach itself to recognize everyday objects, like dogs, cars and flowers.

The system was so effective that Google bought the tiny start-up these researchers were only just getting off the ground. And soon, their system sparked a technological revolution. Suddenly, machines could “see” in a way that was not possible in the past.

This made it easier for a smartphone app to search your personal photos and find the images you were looking for. It accelerated the progress of driverless cars and other robotics. And it improved the accuracy of facial recognition services, for social networks like Facebook and for the country’s law enforcement agencies.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Thursday stayed the execution of a Buddhist inmate in Texas whose request that his spiritual adviser be present in the execution chamber had been denied.

In a brief, unsigned order, the court said that Texas may not execute the inmate, Patrick H. Murphy, “unless the state permits Murphy’s Buddhist spiritual adviser or another Buddhist reverend of the state’s choosing to accompany Murphy in the execution chamber during the execution.”

Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil M. Gorsuch said they would have allowed the execution to proceed.

In a concurring opinion, Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh wrote that the state’s policy of allowing only Christian and Muslim chaplains to attend executions amounted to unconstitutional religious discrimination. “The government may not discriminate against religion generally or against particular religious denominations,” he wrote.

“In this case,” he wrote, “the relevant Texas policy allows a Christian or Muslim inmate to have a state-employed Christian or Muslim religious adviser present either in the execution room or in the adjacent viewing room. But inmates of other religious denominations — for example, Buddhist inmates such as Murphy — who want their religious adviser to be present can have the religious adviser present only in the viewing room and not in the execution room itself for their executions.”</TEXT>

Given the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s difficulty running a functional subway system, it might be unrealistic to expect subway stations to have decent bathrooms. It’s not the Metropolitan Restroom Authority.

But subway bathrooms have long occupied an inner ring of the city’s underworld, each grim, battered door a portal to a multisensory nightmare.

Or so we had heard. In 25 combined years in the city, these two reporters had never summoned the courage to enter one.</TEXT>

The police officers who patrol New York City’s transit system are constantly scanning subway stations looking for a familiar set of faces: repeat sexual offenders who have arrest records.

The officers follow them through jam-packed platforms and onto crowded trains, waiting to see if they grope, grind, molest or indecently expose themselves again.

Because only then can the police intervene and make an arrest or eject them from the subway system.

The authorities have long been frustrated by not being able to keep known subway sexual harassers from returning to the scene of their crimes.

But now, lawmakers and police officials are pushing a dramatic measure: On Monday, a city councilman, Chaim M. Deutsch, introduced a bill that would bar repeat sexual offenders from the subway system for life.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Well, O.K.: Data might not be sold. But it is used. And luxury has benefited.

When Ms. Oluwole opened her division four years ago, she said, she faced resistance from the old-school fashion names, long averse to digital novelty. Slowly, she earned executives’ trust — not only because she is a savvy marketer with a master’s degree in business administration from Columbia University, but also because she is a devoted luxury consumer. On the day of the interview, she had augmented her swishy navy Maje minidress with Chanel boots that had a golf-ball-size pearl suspended in each clear Lucite heel, a stainless-steel Rolex Datejust watch and a Louis Vuitton ring adorned with the initial M.

Her iPhone was enveloped by a Goyard case. Her business card holder: Chanel. This season, she attended the Christian Dior and Berluti shows. “Luxury is what I do,” she said, “but it’s also part of my innate life.”

Born in Lagos, Nigeria, to a family of doctors and lawyers, and educated in England, Ms. Oluwole joined Facebook in 2006, when she was a pre-med undergrad at Stanford University and the start-up was still an inter-university network with just 150 employees. In 2013, she saw the potential of the fashion world, and persuaded her then-boss Carolyn Everson, Facebook’s vice president of global marketing solutions, to establish a department focused squarely on the luxury sector.

In 2015, Ms. Oluwole opened her two-person “global luxury hub” in Paris. She rented a small apartment in the hipster neighborhood of Montorgueil (and has since bought a home in the tony 16th Arrondissement) and enrolled in French classes at the Alliance Française.

About the same time, Instagram hired Eva Chen , the well-connected former editor in chief of Lucky magazine, as director of fashion partnerships for the platform in New York. Ms. Chen’s brief has been to consult with fashionable figures, such as models, designers, stylists and celebrities, and help them create posts that increase their followers (her services are free).</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Mac D’Alessandro, the state director of Voter Choice Massachusetts, said it was unfortunately common for candidates in the state to win elections without a majority because of a split vote. The Tuesday election in Fall River, he said, “provides a striking example of the need for a different way of voting, moving past the pick-one plurality system.”

His organization advocates ranked choice voting, a system in which voters rank candidates in the order of preference, and last-place candidates are eliminated one by one until a candidate achieves a majority.

Mr. Correia became Fall River’s youngest mayor when he took office in January 2016 at age 24. He campaigned as a forceful advocate for economic development and revitalizing the downtown area in the city of about 90,000, once home to a flourishing textile industry that declined during the last century.

In October, Mr. Correia was indicted on charges related to SnoOwl, a technology company he founded in 2012.

In the federal indictment, filed in the United States District Court of Massachusetts, Mr. Correia was accused of defrauding SnoOwl investors by “making false representations and diverting a significant portion of the investors’ fund to himself.” He pleaded not guilty and has said that the indictment was politically motivated.

In light of the charges, city councilors gave Mr. Correia a December deadline to resign or else face a recall. The mayor decided to stay in office. “It is because of my strong belief that the choice rests with the people of our city that I ask the public once again to reaffirm their vote for me,” he said in a statement on Dec. 26.

In the buildup to the recall election, Mr. Correia cited achievements including hiring more police officers and firefighters and eliminating unpopular fees for waste disposal services.

It was not enough to win over a majority of the people who cast ballots on Tuesday. But it was enough to keep him in office.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Christina Goldbaum, an immigration reporter in The New York Times’s Metro department, explored Mr. McMahon’s story, and those of migrants who work at farms like his, in an article this week. Read more about it here.

This week, KPBS, a public radio station in Southern California, launched a new podcast, “Only Here,” about life and culture in San Diego and Tijuana — “the art, food, traditions and culture that exists because of the border,” they write. The first episode profiles a young photographer who is gay and undocumented, and you can listen to it, along with other episodes, here.

Podcast creators, like everyone else, have been drawn to stories and conversations about the border. If you prefer your stories in audio form, here are a few more to get you started:
• “The Green Line,” produced by the union of Border Patrol agents. The hosts, Art Del Cueto and Brandon Judd, are Border Patrol agents who have been supportive of President Trump’s policies — and both appeared at his side in the White House briefing room in January when he talked about declaring a national emergency to help build a border wall. (The Times has written about them before.)
• Last spring, WNYC’s Radiolab ran “Border Project,” a three-part series about a Border Patrol policy that most likely led to a rise, beginning in the late 1990s, in the number of migrants who died while crossing to the United States. It also profiles some of the migrants who made the trek despite it. Listen to all the episodes here.
• This episode of PRX’s Radio Diaries, “The Border Wall,” focuses on those strange parts of the border that one woman calls a “no-man’s land,” cut off from their country by a barrier that doesn’t always follow the line it’s meant to.
• Our very own “Daily” podcast has many great episodes from the border. Start with a two-part series, “Dispatches From the Border” (Part 1 here and Part 2 here), which follows Azam Ahmed, the Times bureau chief for Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, and other Times journalists on a trip along the nearly 2,000-mile border with Mexico. Then there’s this episode, “The Scars of Family Separation,” about a migrant father who crossed the border with his daughter. Finally, from last summer, “How Separating Migrant Families Became U.S. Policy” is an interview with Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser who has helped the president frame his immigration policy.

      <TEXT>Re “Appalachia Is Not What You Think” (Op-Ed, March 16):

Robert Gipe is right: Appalachian coal miners need less political posturing and more good jobs. Those jobs are right under the miners’ feet: restoring the natural environment of a region devastated by a century and a half of coal mining that has left streams polluted, mountains leveled and industrial waste choking once-scenic hillsides and hollows.

Miners already have the skills necessary to do the job of returning the most scenic areas of America to its former beauty. They know how to operate and maintain heavy equipment, pour concrete, manage water and do multiple kinds of construction.

With decent pay and benefits, miners will be eager to make coal country a destination for recreation of all kinds and a place that can attract new businesses and rejuvenate those already on the Main Streets of its towns and cities.

Badly needed government initiatives to invest in rebuilding America should not forget coal country and its miners.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>How Did You Get Your ‘Game’ On?

In our last installment, we asked you how and when you started watching “Game of Thrones.” Thank you to everyone who wrote in: We love hearing about your “Thrones” obsessions. Here’s a small selection of reader memories, lightly edited for clarity.

My son Ben, then 16, wanted me to watch “Game of Thrones” with him when it first started. I thought it was about a video game. We had watched “The Tudors” together, with me covering his eyes for the naked parts. I made a plot diagram of the first book, which my son thought was quaint. “You know, Mom, they have those on the internet.” He’s 23 now. It’s been a bonding thing for us.

I watched all of Season 1 with my wife in one day … the day after Super Bowl 46. I’m a Ravens fan, and the Ravens had just lost the AFC Championship in brutal fashion, and in order to get myself through the big game, I drank myself stupid with a friend. Needless to say, my wife and I called out sick on Monday and said, “Let’s try this ‘Game of Thrones’ show.” Ten hours and two food deliveries later, we were done with Season 1.

I kept seeing references to “Game of Thrones” and whether Jon Snow was alive or dead. Then, I read that Barack Obama had approached somebody affiliated with the show at a Hollywood fund-raiser and asked them about Snow. So, that did it. I decided to find out what the fuss was about. I ordered the Season 1 DVDs from Netflix, and soon my husband and I were binge watching. I finally gave in and subscribed to HBO for Season 7, something I had avoided for years and years. Sigh. Now, I’ve read all the books and own a large book of maps of Westeros.

Back in the summer of 2011, as a sophomore in college, I stumbled across “Game of Thrones” when I was staying in an isolated log cabin in Rocky Mountain National Park. I threw on the pilot late at night expecting a medieval drama. I was not expecting a chilling, blue-eyed zombie child. Let’s just say the sound of wind rushing through the pine trees and creaky floorboards did not help me sleep that night.

I started watching it during Season 4 because my friends were raving about the gorgeous scenery from Iceland and Croatia. We are in our late 50s, long past our days of unicorns and princesses. Reluctantly, I started watching. Overall, I was terribly alarmed by the universe of moral ambivalence. It seemed like such a vivid parallel for today’s world. Now the show has become a ridiculous addiction that I dare not admit to my family or friends, but it is so fascinating and chilling that I can’t help myself.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Rockefeller Center has long had a springtime ritual of displaying contemporary art — one work. Last year’s piece was by the German artist Anselm Kiefer.

This year, it will display 20, starting on April 25, through an arrangement with Frieze, the media and events company whose Frieze New York art fair will begin a week later, on May 2. EB Kelly, a managing director of Tishman Speyer, the real estate firm that controls Rockefeller Center, said a shuttle for art-fair patrons would run from Rockefeller Center to Frieze New York on Randalls Island, in the shadow of the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge.

The works bound for Rockefeller Center include several by the Polish-born Goshka Macuga, a set of sculptures by the American artist Walter De Maria, and four pieces by the Brazilian Conceptualist Paulo Nazareth depicting figures from the American civil rights movement: the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.; Rosa Parks, who refused to give up her seat on a segregated bus in Montgomery, Ala.; Tommie Smith, a sprinter who gave a black power salute at the 1968 Olympics; and Ruby Bridges, the first black child to integrate an elementary school in the South, in New Orleans in 1960.

Brett Littman, director of the Noguchi Museum in Queens, will curate the Rockefeller Center display, selecting and placing the works on the site.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>He is clearly a master of writing for orchestra, of exploiting its individual sections and instruments — even the sum of its parts — for maximal effect. But his artistry doesn’t quite match his skill. The music thrills more than it intrigues; it prefers to make blunt declarations, not thoroughly persuasive arguments.

Mr. Cruz’s words, however, are poetic and poignant, reminiscent of Alice Goodman’s librettos for the John Adams operas “Nixon in China” and “The Death of Klinghoffer,” which occupy a dreamy realm between historical fact and ethereal enigma. Although Mr. Cruz took his inspiration from conversations with undocumented students at Berkeley, he describes immigration as if were a story as old as time itself: “It came with the yearn / of a leaf, three clouds, / and a woman who dreamt / she was walking / towards the edge / of the world. / And the right / to migrate / was granted.”

If only the score matched this poetry. The text often gets the treatment of an action-movie soundtrack — frenetic and epic, rarely softer than fortissimo, occasionally taking a turn for the obvious and gimmicky. At one point, Ms. Martínez is made to sing the line “Who has stopped them,” then shout angrily at the audience: “FROM BEING CHILDREN?”

But Ms. Martínez, who had a star turn in “Madama Butterfly” at the Metropolitan Opera in 2016, often rose above the quality of the music, with a sound that penetrated the orchestra and chorus without losing an ounce of its heart. Mr. Salonen and the Philharmonia musicians, too, lifted the score, bringing to this oratorio the same energy and enthusiasm they had in a virtually flawless performance of Schoenberg and Bruckner the evening before, and in Stravinsky’s “Firebird” on the second half of Sunday’s concert.

And they did sometimes have rich material to work with. The opening section comes to life slowly: at first with Ms. Martínez alone, then accompanying her with a cosmic glow as she almost ritualistically describes a time “before the divide of lands.” As she later contemplates the children swept up in the border crisis, the orchestra is tense, dissonant and unsettling.

Mr. López is most creative — and restrained — in the fourth section, “A Dreamer Who Studied Linguistics,” which begins with an eerie buzz that grows like a swarm and, as it reaches a chaotic climax, cuts to silence for an aria about what it’s like to live in silence “with the secret / that I am landless.” Although the vocal line here is lyrical and direct, stormy orchestral interludes suggest inner turmoil.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Here’s what else you need to know today. On Monday, a House committee released testimony from a whistleblower who said that the Trump administration had granted security clearances to at least 25 people who were previously denied such clearances because of concerns about their background. The whistleblower, a manager involved in White House hiring, told a House committee that the original denials had been based on a variety of factors, including conflicts of interest, financial problems, drug use and criminal conduct. The White House is allowed to overturn denials of security clearances. But the whistleblower said she was alarmed by the frequency of the practice in the Trump administration, which she said was not always acting, quote, “in the best interest of national security.” And that’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro.

      <TEXT>Details: Britain, Germany, India and the United Arab Emirates are signaling that they probably will not back the American effort to ban Huawei from building its 5G networks. Although some countries share America’s concerns, they say the security risks can be managed by keeping a close eye on the company and its software.

Here’s what else is happening

Venezuela: President Nicolás Maduro used Cuban doctors, who were in the country on medical missions, to coerce voters. The doctors went door-to-door, warning ill and elderly people that care would be cut off if they did not vote for the governing party.

West Bank: An assailant believed to be Palestinian killed an Israeli soldier in the occupied West Bank. The attack came amid a heated campaign for an April 9 election.

Philippines: The country formally withdrew from the International Criminal Court as it faced a preliminary inquiry into whether President Rodrigo Duterte has engaged in mass murder and crimes against humanity. On Thursday, Mr. Duterte publicly released a new list of people whom he claims are “narcopoliticians” — including many who are his political opponents.

France: In Week 18 of the country’s “Yellow Vest” demonstrations, violence surged as protesters targeted symbols of wealth. They set fires and smashed a high-end restaurant on the Champs-Élysées. Still, the size of the movement has been shrinking.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>For weeks, analysts have speculated that Tesla has seen a marked drop in sales since the beginning of the year, and the electric-car maker’s recent gyrations on price cuts and cost-saving initiatives have only bolstered their suspicions.

Recently compiled data on new-car registrations from a large portion of the United States seems to offer further support for that view. According to the Dominion Cross-Sell Report, a compilation drawn from state motor vehicle records, registrations of new Tesla vehicles fell significantly from January to February in the 23 states the report covers. The states include California, which accounts for about half of Tesla’s sales, as well as Texas, Florida and Washington, three other big markets for the carmaker.

Last month, 6,252 Teslas were registered with motor vehicle agencies in the 23 states, compared with 23,310 in January and a monthly average of 13,000 to 17,000 in the fourth quarter. The totals tend to reflect a lag because cars are often not registered until the month after purchase.

In December, Tesla was scrambling to sell cars before the end of the year because the federal tax credit available to its customers was set to fall by half on Jan. 1, to $3,850. So a surge in January registrations would not be unexpected. The question is whether an ensuing downturn like the one reflected in the Dominion data would prove lasting.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>But the captain of the Max 8 that crashed this month in Ethiopia shortly after takeoff, killing all 157 people on board, never trained on the simulator, according to people close to the airline’s operations . Another Max 8 crashed five months ago in Indonesia in a similar way.

Background: Even after the crash in Indonesia, Boeing had said that pilots experienced with older models of the 737 did not need additional simulator training, and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration agreed. That thinking is set to come under official scrutiny. Also, many pilots were not originally informed of the existence of an automated system suspected of playing a role in both crashes.

Top F.A.A. officials were not aware of the software system and special attention was not paid to it, according to people with knowledge of the safety certification process for the Max 8. The plane is now grounded worldwide as Boeing races to come up with a fix to the system, which can push the plane’s nose down if it approaches a stall.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Were Republican House members enthusiastic or morose as they decided to turn off their own moral circuits, when they decided to be monumentally unconcerned by the fact that their leader may be a moral cretin?

Do they think that having anesthetized their moral sense in this case they will simply turn it on again down the road? Having turned off their soul at work, do they think they will be able to turn it on again when they go home to the spouse and kids?

This is how moral corrosion happens. Supporting Trump requires daily acts of moral distancing, a process that means that after a few months you are tolerant of any corruption. You are morally numb to everything. You end up where Representative Jim Jordan blandly ended up Wednesday, in referring to the hush-money scheme: “I think it’s news we knew about.”

I’ve heard the rationalizations. This is gang warfare. We have to do everything we can to defend our team. The other team leaves us no choice. Those are the sorts of things people say to give themselves permission to yield to their venal ambitions. Those are the sorts of things rookies and amateurs say.

Professionals know that effectiveness in any realm, especially politics, depends on having some guiding and consistent integrity that people can trust, loyalty to something higher than your next appearance on Fox or MSNBC.

Here is the commandment that experience teaches us: Immorality usually bites you in the ass. If you behave in a way that betrays relationship and obliterates the truth and erases your own integrity, you will sooner or later wind up where Michael Cohen has wound up — having ruined your life.

In “East of Eden,” John Steinbeck writes: “Humans are caught — in their lives, in their thoughts, in their hungers and ambitions, in their avarice and cruelty, and in their kindness and generosity too — in a net of good and evil. I think this is the only story we have and that it occurs on all levels of feeling and intelligence. Virtue and vice were warp and woof of our first consciousness, and they will be the fabric of our last. … A man, after he has brushed off the dust and chips of his life, will have left only the hard clean questions: was it good or was it evil? Have I done well — or ill.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Survivors themselves know this. That’s why fully 90 percent of survivors in New York City, when given the chance to choose whether they want the person who harmed them incarcerated or in a restorative justice process — one that offers support to survivors while empowering them to help decide how perpetrators of violence can repair the damage they’ve done — choose the latter and opt to use the services of Ms. Sered’s nonprofit organization , Common Justice.

Ms. Sered launched Common Justice in an effort to give survivors of violence — like herself — a meaningful pathway to accountability without perpetuating the harms endemic to mass incarceration. As a restorative justice program, it offers a survivor-centered accountability process that “gives those directly impacted by acts of violence the opportunity to shape what repair will look like, and, in the case of the responsible party, to carry out that repair instead of going to prison.” The people who choose to participate are victims of serious violent felonies — people who have been shot, stabbed or robbed — and who decide that they would prefer to get answers from the person who harmed them, be heard in a restorative justice circle, help to devise an accountability plan, and receive comprehensive victim services, rather than send the person who harmed them to prison.

Ninety percent is a stunning figure considering everything we’ve been led to believe that survivors actually want. For years, we’ve been told that victims of violence want nothing more than for the people who hurt them to be locked up and treated harshly. It is true that some survivors do want revenge or retribution, especially in the immediate aftermath of the crime. Ms. Sered is emphatic that rage is not pathological and a desire for revenge is not blameworthy; both are normal and can be important to the healing process, much as denial and anger are normal stages of grief.

But she also stresses that the number of people who are interested only in revenge or punishment is greatly exaggerated. After all, survivors are almost never offered real choices. Usually when we ask victims “Do you want incarceration?” what we’re really asking is “Do you want something or nothing?” And when any of us are hurt, and when our families and communities are hurting, we want something rather than nothing. In many oppressed communities, drug treatment, good schools, economic investment, job training, trauma and grief support are not available options. Restorative justice is not an option. The only thing on offer is prisons, prosecutors and police.

But what happens, Ms. Sered wondered, if instead of asking, “Do you want something or nothing?” we started asking “Do you want this intervention or that prison?” It turns out, when given a real choice, very few survivors choose prison as their preferred response.

This is not because survivors, as a group, are especially merciful. To the contrary, they’re pragmatic. They know the criminal justice system will almost certainly fail to deliver what they want and need most to overcome their pain and trauma. More than 95 percent of cases end in plea bargains negotiated by lawyers behind the scenes. Given the system’s design, survivors know the system cannot be trusted to validate their suffering, give them answers or even a meaningful opportunity to be heard. Nor can it be trusted to keep them or others safe.

In fact, many victims find that incarceration actually makes them feel less safe. They worry that others will be angry with them for reporting the crime and retaliate, or fear what will happen when the person eventually returns home. Many believe, for good reason, that incarceration will likely make the person worse, not better — a frightening prospect when they’re likely to encounter the person again when they’re back in the neighborhood.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WASHINGTON — The Senate on Wednesday again rebuked President Trump for his continued defense of Saudi Arabia after the killing of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi, voting for a second time to end American military assistance for the kingdom’s war in Yemen and to curtail presidential war powers.

The 54-to-46 vote, condemning a nearly four-year conflict in Yemen that has killed thousands of civilians and inflicted a devastating famine, sets the foundation for what could become Mr. Trump’s first presidential veto, with the House expected to overwhelmingly pass the measure, possibly this month. The vote also might be the opening salvo in a week where Senate Republicans have the opportunity to hit back at the president’s aggressive use of executive power. On Thursday, the chamber will vote on a resolution that would overturn Mr. Trump’s declaration of a national emergency to secure funding for his border wall.

“The United States Congress is going to reassert its constitutional responsibility over issues of war that have been abdicated for presidents, Democrats and Republicans, for too many years,” said Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont.

Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, encouraged lawmakers on Wednesday to oppose the Yemen resolution, calling it “inappropriate and counterproductive” and warning them not to conflate their displeasure with the administration’s response to Mr. Khashoggi’s death with the broader issue of the conflict in Yemen. But in a show of defiance, seven Republican senators broke ranks to join the resolution: Mike Lee, of Utah; Susan Collins of Maine; Steve Daines of Montana; Jerry Moran of Kansas; Lisa Murkowski of Alaska; Rand Paul of Kentucky; and Todd Young of Indiana.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, explained, “This is a vote for the Constitution and for the balance of powers that is at its core.”

Shortly after the vote Thursday afternoon, Mr. Trump took to Twitter. “VETO!” he wrote.

For the record, the Republican senators voting for the resolution (and against the president’s power grab) were, in addition to Mr. Romney: Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Roy Blunt of Missouri, Susan Collins of Maine, Mike Lee of Utah, Jerry Moran of Kansas, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Rob Portman of Ohio, Marco Rubio of Florida, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Roger Wicker of Mississippi.

It is notable that this brushback of the president came just one day after the Senate voted 54 to 46 to end American support for Saudi Arabia’s brutal, four-year-old military venture in Yemen. Seven Republicans crossed party lines to pass a bill designed to claw back Congress’s responsibility for declaring war. The measure is expected to pass the House as well, provoking a second presidential veto.

In both cases, Mr. Trump lobbied Republicans, publicly and privately, to stand by him — if only to limit his margins of loss. He reportedly dangled funding promises in front of some members, even as he continued his Twitter taunts, including this Thursday gem: “A vote for today’s resolution by Republican Senators is a vote for Nancy Pelosi, Crime, and the Open Border Democrats!”

But neither sticks nor carrots were enough to spare the president back-to-back humiliations.

Senate Republicans were not exactly eager to cross Mr. Trump. In the lead-up to Thursday’s vote, members scrambled to avoid a confrontation. Mr. Lee put together a proposal to reform the National Emergencies Act. His bill, introduced Tuesday, would have automatically ended future declarations after 30 days, unless Congress voted to extend them. As an opening bid, the idea was worth debating, seeing as how the current law is clearly prone to abuse.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Guli is sponsored by Reebok, which gives her gear, a media campaign around her quest and, maybe most important of all, for the logistics of her quest, money. She is not entirely an unknown — she is the founder and chief executive of Thirst, a nonprofit that raises awareness about the global water crisis — but she is hardly a social media star. Her Instagram account has just over 3,000 followers, a pittance in the influencer world.

In other words, Reebok isn’t just throwing products at runners in exchange for pretty pictures on their Instagram feeds. Rather, Reebok and other companies are going after unique narratives they hope will inspire people. They're doing this at a time when participants are as likely to be influenced by what someone who looks like them is wearing as the runner who ends up with a gold medal.

“Ultimately, they want to be able to tell a story,” said Merhawi Keflezighi, founder and president of HAWI Management, which represents athletes like his brother Meb, the long-distance runner, and the Paralympic sprinter Jarryd Wallace.

Meb Keflezighi was second in the Olympic Marathon in 2004 in Athens, and won the New York City Marathon in 2009 and Boston in 2014. Merhawi Keflezighi has been an agent since 2005, and seen the types of sponsorship deals widen in that time. “People can relate to others when it’s not just the fastest person in the world or the strongest person in the world,” he said.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>After putting himself through college by working odd jobs as a dishwasher and overnight dockworker, Mr. Khuzami has had a number of brushes with power, both in the places he worked and the people he prosecuted.

In his earlier Southern District stint, in the 1990s, Mr. Khuzami cut his teeth as a terrorism and financial crimes prosecutor. In perhaps his biggest case, Mr. Khuzami helped secure the conviction of Omar Abdel Rahman and other conspirators in a plot to blow up New York City landmarks.

In 2002, he joined Deutsche Bank, where he ultimately became general counsel for the firm’s American arm. He left in 2009, during the Obama administration, to run the Securities and Exchange Commission’s enforcement division, where he sued Goldman Sachs over financial crisis-era misconduct.

In his role as deputy United States attorney over the past 15 months, Mr. Khuzami has overseen several investigations that Mr. Berman was recused from, but none was more prominent than Mr. Cohen’s case, which burst into public view in April 2018 when the F.B.I. raided Mr. Cohen’s home, office and hotel room.

Four months later, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to breaking campaign finance laws, including for paying $130,000 to the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels to keep her quiet about an affair she said she had with Mr. Trump. Mr. Khuzami’s prosecutors argued that the payment was an excessive contribution to Mr. Trump’s campaign, noting that Ms. Daniels’s silence bolstered his election chances and that campaign finance law caps individual donations to a presidential candidate in the general election at $2,700.

In seeking a stiff sentence for Mr. Cohen, Mr. Khuzami’s prosecutors contended in a court filing that “he acted in coordination with and at the direction of” Mr. Trump. The president later suggested that Mr. Khuzami’s prosecutors used the case against Mr. Cohen to embarrass him.

Even with Mr. Khuzami’s departure, the Southern District is expected to continue its investigation into the hush money payments, which could involve a decision about whether to take any future action against Mr. Trump or others at the Trump Organization, where Mr. Cohen had worked for a decade.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The Food and Drug Administration said on Tuesday that it had approved a new generic version of the widely used blood pressure drug Diovan, or valsartan, which has been in short supply following recalls made because of chemical contamination.

The new version is being made by Alkem Laboratories Limited, based in Mumbai, India.

“The F.D.A. prioritized the review of this drug application to help relieve the recent shortage of this critical medicine as a result of multiple recalls of generic valsartan products from several manufacturers,” the agency said in a statement.

The recalls began in July when the F.D.A. found that some valsartan products contained a potentially cancer-causing chemical, a type of nitrosamine called N-nitrosodimethylamine, or NDMA. European regulators had already made the same discovery. The substance can form during manufacturing if the chemical reactions used to make the drug are not carefully controlled and monitored, the F.D.A. said.

Nitrosamines can cause tumors in the liver and other organs in lab animals and are thought to be carcinogenic in humans as well.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Contrary to his public statements, Trump pursued business in Russia deep into the presidential race.

Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to another charge: lying to Congress about how long Mr. Trump pursued a real estate project in Russia during 2016. His plea demonstrated that Mr. Trump had continued to negotiate over a proposed Trump Tower Moscow deep into the campaign — even as he publicly encouraged the Russians to hack Mrs. Clinton’s emails and the Kremlin kept up its effort to help his campaign.

As the investigations around Mr. Trump intensified at the end of the year, he tried a familiar tactic: He asked his acting attorney general to try to exert more control over the investigations related to Mr. Cohen.

In January, Mr. Mueller continued his pursuit of those around Mr. Trump, indicting the president’s longtime adviser, Roger Stone, on charges of lying to Congress about his contacts with WikiLeaks during the campaign. The indictment contained a curious detail. It said that a senior campaign official “was directed” by an unnamed person to have Mr. Stone inquire from WikiLeaks about the future release of material damaging to Mrs. Clinton.
• None Prosecutors Effectively Accuse Trump of Defrauding Voters. What Does It Mean?

Cohen raises the possibility of additional criminal liability for Trump.

In a daylong appearance before the House Oversight Committee, Mr. Cohen turned on the boss he had once said he would “take a bullet” to protect. He said he had only “suspicions” of a Trump-Russia connection but laid out evidence of a range of possible crimes with no Russian connection.

He displayed a check signed by the president, he said was to reimburse him for hush money payments, that could implicate Mr. Trump in a campaign finance violation. He described how Mr. Trump inflated and deflated the value of his assets to get loans or reduce taxes, actions that could amount to bank fraud, insurance fraud and tax evasion. He said Mr. Trump had indicated, without directly instructing him, that he should lie to Congress. He described how Mr. Trump had used his charity to purchase a portrait of himself, in evident violation of state laws governing charitable foundations.
• None Michael Cohen Accuses Trump of Expansive Pattern of Lies and Criminality
• None Testimony From Cohen Could Compound Legal Issues for Trump

Mr. Mueller delivered a lengthy report to Attorney General William P. Barr last month. Two days later, Mr. Barr announced that Mr. Mueller “did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with&quot; Russia.

A more clouded picture emerged on the question of whether Mr. Trump illegally obstructed justice. Mr. Barr said that Mr. Mueller declined to determine whether Mr. Trump broke the law but also pointedly did not exonerate him. Mr. Barr said that left it to him to make the judgment, and that he and Mr. Rosenstein concluded that Mr. Trump had not violated the law. But some of the special counsel’s investigators told associates that Mr. Barr failed to adequately portray their findings and that they were more troubling for Mr. Trump than his attorney general indicated.
• None Mueller Finds No Trump-Russia Conspiracy, but Stops Short of Exonerating President on Obstruction
• None Some on Mueller’s Team Say Report Was More Damaging Than Barr Revealed

If Mr. Mueller portrays Mr. Trump as intent on using his power to protect himself and his associates from an investigation, the revelations could prompt Democrats to expand their investigations into the president and even consider impeachment. But if the report simply summarizes what is already known, it could embolden Mr. Trump, who has already begun calling for scrutiny of the investigation’s origins.</TEXT>

The Democratic National Committee has selected Milwaukee as the site of its national convention, placing a spotlight on a key Midwestern battleground state that Democrats lost for the first time in three decades in 2016 and see as central to the party’s efforts to reclaim the White House.

The convention will be held next year on July 13-16 in the newly built Fiserv Forum, a 17,500-seat arena that’s home to the N.B.A.’s Milwaukee Bucks.

Milwaukee was selected over a pair of larger Sunbelt cities, Houston and Miami, to host the event.

Milwaukee organizers raised more than $10 million and reassured officials that they had secured sufficient hotel capacity for the event, ameliorating concerns that the city lacked the finances and infrastructure to support an event that regularly draws tens of thousands of out-of-town activists, officials and media.

Wisconsin holds a searing place in the Democratic Party psyche after Hillary Clinton, the party’s last presidential nominee, opted not to campaign in the traditionally blue state during the general election — a decision that some blamed for her 22,000-vote defeat in the state.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>While the details have not been disclosed, Mr. Ghaemi said, at least seven charges are believed to have been lodged against Ms. Sotoudeh. They included collusion against national security, anti-state propaganda, membership in illicit groups, appearing before the judiciary without the required head covering, disturbing the peace, publishing falsehoods to disturb public opinion, and “encouraging corruption and prostitution.”

“Each charge has many years,” Mr. Ghaemi said. “It could be a very lengthy sentence.”

Ms. Sotoudeh’s conviction has not been reported in official Iranian news media. There was no immediate response to a request for comment from Iran’s United Nations mission in New York.

The prosecution of Ms. Sotoudeh has come against the backdrop of a resurgence of influence by the most hard-line elements of Iran’s leadership, particularly since the Trump administration took office two years ago.

President Trump has moved aggressively to ostracize Iran, renouncing the nuclear agreement it reached with the Obama administration and five other world powers, and reimposing sanctions that the accord had eased in return for Iran’s peaceful nuclear development.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, has said the Trump administration’s policies proved his longstanding suspicion that the United States could not be trusted — a view that may have emboldened the hard-liners in the government and weakened President Hassan Rouhani, who is considered a relative moderate.

The National Iranian American Council, a Washington-based group that advocates for improved relations with Iran but is highly critical of the country’s human rights record, said it was appalled by news of Ms. Sotoudeh’s conviction and called for her immediate release.

Jamal Abdi, the council’s president, said in a statement that responsibility for Ms. Sotoudeh’s incarceration “lies squarely with the Iranian authorities.” But he also pointed a finger at the Trump administration.

“As hard-liners seek to match Trump’s bellicosity and undermine moderates and the will of the Iranian people,” Mr. Abdi said, “human rights proponents like Sotoudeh often become the first victims.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Unlike Mr. O’Donnell, Mr. Kohn maintains that Beacon’s newest residents, rather than its oldest, are in favor of buildings like 344 Main Street.

“There’s younger people and older people who want different things,” he said. “You can’t satisfy everybody. It’s a different style, a different era. And for the same reason that we have all of these new apartments in Brooklyn, in Manhattan, in Queens, they want them over here as well.”

The moratorium won by the People’s Committee on Development expired in March of 2018. Since then, the committee has supported an ongoing rezoning initiative taken up by the City Council, which would limit the height of new construction, recategorize commercial, residential, and industrial use areas, and protect historic landmarks.

Amid the dozen new proposals that have since been reviewed by the planning board, projects have appeared that will make 344 Main Street look small, such as Edgewater, a 12-acre, seven-building, 307-unit development on the Hudson River in the northwestern part of the city. The developers behind Edgewater have pitched their project as attracting millennials with amenities like a co-working space, and it is currently making its way through the local planning board.

Whether returning Beacon to its heyday or rebuilding its cityscape in anticipation of newcomers, the developers have a vision to advance. Residents may disagree and continue to fight against what they see as the destruction of their city, but even they recognize that they need to provide a comprehensive alternative for Beacon’s future.

“The culture of development needs to shift in Beacon,” Mr. Aymar-Blair said. “A town with the success that we’ve had has every right to be in the driver’s seat about what gets built in this town and not, and to be influential over what we need and what we want and what is going to serve the public interest. We need a vision. We still lack a vision of what we want Beacon to look like in, say, 15 years.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>A dual citizen of Saudi Arabia and the United States had been imprisoned in the Ritz Carlton in Riyadh for about a week when he heard a knock on his door.

Guards dragged Walid Fitaihi, a Harvard-trained physician, to another room, according to a friend who took down the prisoner’s detailed account of his treatment. Dr. Fitaihi told the friend he was slapped, blindfolded, stripped to his underwear and bound to a chair. He was shocked with electricity in what appears to have been a single session of torture that lasted about an hour.

His tormentors whipped his back so severely that he could not sleep on it for days, his friend said, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid reprisals. The doctor had described the physical abuse, in general terms, to his relatives as well, a person close to them said.

Detained in November 2017 in what was billed as a crackdown on corruption, Dr. Fitaihi, 54, remains imprisoned without any public charges or trial. About 200 prominent Saudis were detained with him, and he is one of dozens who remain in prison.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Over the next three days, she spoke to the authorities at least six times. Although her story sometimes shifted, with different details about what her alleged assailants did to her and who had done it first, her basic account remained unchanged.

The woman said that the former detectives pulled her over at about 8 p.m. the night before, while she was driving with two male friends in Calvert Vaux Park, near Coney Island. After they found drugs in the car, she said, they handcuffed her, placed her in an unmarked van and drove away.

She told the police several times that she was wearing a miniskirt that night, which made it easy, she explained, for the men to sexually assault her as they left Coney Island and drove up the Belt Parkway as far north as Bay Ridge. She also said she remembered the specific route because she recognized some landmarks: the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge and her grandmother’s apartment on Shore Road.

But by 2 p.m. on the first day of their inquiry, investigators found security camera footage showing the woman leaving the police van in sweatpants, not a miniskirt, according to a detective’s report in the court record.

Hours later, court papers said, investigators also found the van, which did not quite match the description she had given. The van had bucket seats, not bench seats, as the woman had repeatedly recounted. She had also recalled seeing a laptop on the dashboard of the van, but there was not one, court papers said.

By Sept. 18, a prosecutor on the case had already “expressed her concern” about these discrepancies, police records show.

On Oct. 19, Mr. Bederow wrote a letter to the district attorney’s office citing “red flags” in the woman’s account and urging caution. Four days later, the lead prosecutor, Mr. DeGaetano, called a detective on the case asking if he could pinpoint the defendants’ “GPS location” through their phones.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand — Abdul Aziz was praying with his four sons in the Linwood Mosque when he heard the gunshots. Rather than run from the noise, he ran toward it, grabbed the first thing he could find — a credit card machine — and flung it at the attacker.

The man dropped a shotgun, and Mr. Aziz picked it up. “I pulled the trigger, and there was nothing,” he recalled. The gunman ran to his car, where he had other weapons, and Mr. Aziz followed, throwing the shotgun at the vehicle and shattering a window.

Mr. Aziz’s actions, which he and others described in interviews, may have prompted the gunman to speed away rather than return to kill more people. Minutes later, two police officers from another town who were in the area rammed the suspect’s car into a curb and took him into custody, ending the worst mass murder in New Zealand’s modern history.

The authorities have not released a detailed account of the police response to Friday’s massacre at two mosques in the city of Christchurch, emphasizing that officers apprehended the suspect only 36 minutes after receiving the first emergency call.

But interviews with dozens of survivors, and an analysis of a video recorded by the attacker as well as one made of his arrest by a bystander, suggest that the violence ended after a near miss by the police at the first mosque — and acts of courage during and after the attack on the second.

If not for the two police officers, who have not been publicly identified, and Mr. Aziz, 48, a ponytailed furniture shop owner who fled Afghanistan a quarter-century ago, the slaughter might have continued. The suspect had two other guns in his car, the police said, as well as two homemade explosives.

“It absolutely was his intention to continue with his attack,” said Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern after the arrest of Brenton Tarrant, 28, a former personal trainer from Australia who allegedly distributed a manifesto of white extremist hatred minutes before the rampage.

The police said 42 people were killed at central Christchurch’s Al Noor Mosque and seven at the Linwood Mosque, and some attributed the lower toll at Linwood to Mr. Aziz’s decision to confront the gunman. (An additional victim died at a hospital.)</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Few lawmakers have any appetite for a second public vote, however, so the march’s main impact may be as a reflection of growing popular frustration over the gridlock.

What’s next? Officials in the E.U. gave the British Parliament until April 12 to decide what it wants to do, so Brexit will not take effect on March 29, the date set two years ago.

On the table is Prime Minister Theresa May’s widely unpopular draft plan. If lawmakers approve it by the E.U. deadline, Britain will leave the bloc on May 22.

If not, Britain has three choices: a no-deal Brexit on April 12, no Brexit at all or a longer delay of possibly two more years. Parliament has strongly opposed all of these options, too.

Today: Lawmakers are to vote on proposed amendments to Mrs. May’s plan, including one that would allow for a rapid-fire round of voting on alternatives.

Analysis: Ellen Barry, our London correspondent, looks at how some Brexit supporters have shifted from the original goal of a less restrictive relationship with the E.U. to willingness to walk away from the bloc with no deal at all.</TEXT>

As a man shopped with his wife in the Belmont neighborhood of the Bronx on Friday, a woman stepped up to them and said she hated white people. Then she attacked, kicking the man and spraying him with pepper spray, the police said.

The next day, the same person, who is black, approached a man and a woman in the same neighborhood, asked the woman if she was white and then immediately sprayed her in the eyes.

On Saturday, police arrested Thomas Heard, a 37-year-old from the Bronx who identifies as a transgender woman, and charged her with multiple hate-crime felonies and misdemeanors in connection with the two attacks.

Police were also questioning Ms. Heard, who also goes by the name Tasha, about seven similar pepper spray attacks in Manhattan on Friday, which were committed by a woman matching her description.</TEXT>

“The book I can’t get out of my head? The haunting, brutal and funny FRANKENSTEIN IN BAGHDAD, by Ahmed Saadawi. I’m a sucker for a good golem story, whether Mary Shelley’s ‘Frankenstein,’ Pete Hamill’s ‘Snow in August’ or Terry Pratchett’s ‘Feet of Clay.’ This creature is not molded from earth, however, but from the body parts of people killed in post-invasion Iraq, scavenged by a garrulous junk dealer. First, this golem kills those who caused the deaths of the original owners of his several parts; he is a creature of revenge. But as those tasks are completed, mission creep sets in; he finds rationalizations to kill even the innocent, collecting new parts to replace the rotting old ones. (In these wasteful days, it’s good to find someone who is into recycling.) Born in death, the creature has become addicted to life. The more prosaically alive characters, inured by the carnage of Baghdad, are, by comparison, walking dead.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>When Melissa Marti saw the email that caused her to sit in her driveway sobbing into her steering wheel, she knew she was going marry Seth Visser. She just didn’t know when.

“We had been talking about it for years — we had even started making plans,” said Ms. Marti, who is from New Ulm, Minn.

But meeting a deadline to present a marriage certificate to the Roman Catholic school where she worked as a dance coach was not something she was willing to do. And so, in June 2018, a few weeks after she got the email that made her sob, she quit.

Ms. Marti, 40, had been coaching the Sonics Dance Team at Cathedral High School for nearly 20 years when New Ulm Area Catholic Schools officials wrote to say her contract renewal was on hold because her living arrangement was under investigation. Cohabitating, the email said, ran counter to Roman Catholic teachings about marriage being a moral prerequisite to living together. A subsequent letter offered two options for preserving her job as head coach, a position she had held since 2002: She could change her housing situation or present a marriage certificate before June 15, 2018.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>But climate change is not “extremely out of the mainstream.” Concern about climate change in the United States is the highest it has ever been. On the heels of a deadly wildfire season supercharged by climate change and a report by 13 federal agencies finding global warming poses a serious threat to the economy, Americans are more convinced than ever that emissions from tailpipes and smokestacks are having an impact on the planet.

In many ways the Green New Deal, with its call to power the country entirely on wind, solar and other zero-carbon energy and ensuring the United States eliminates as much carbon pollution as it creates by about 2030, has injected a new enthusiasm for tackling the problem: Every Democratic presidential candidate has been pressed on his or her support of the plan, and it has helped propel climate change into a top-tier issue for 2020.

But it also has created awkward moments for moderate Democrats. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, for example, was excoriated and mocked on “Saturday Night Live” after she told a group of visiting school children that she opposed the Green New Deal because it wasn’t practical and “there’s no way to pay for it.” Ms. Feinstein has a 90 percent lifetime rating from the League of Conservation Voters, which rates lawmakers on their environmental votes and policies, and has sponsored major climate change legislation for more than 20 years.

Joseph Pinion, a Republican political consultant who advocates a carbon tax, criticized Green New Deal supporters for making it a purity test of support for to address climate change. He called the resolution “possibly the largest setback in terms of getting Republicans to the table certainly in my lifetime.”

By packaging efforts to curb emissions with unrelated issues like promises of a federal job guarantee, vacation pay for all Americans and a single-payer health care system, he said the Green New Deal feeds the belief among conservatives that Democrats are using climate change as a cover to enact a broadly liberal economic agenda.

“The problem with the Green New Deal is that it unifies Republicans,” Mr. Pinion said. “From your never-Trumpers to your Trump skeptics to your Trumportunists, all of these individuals are united in the idea that the policies of a Green New Deal would be disastrous for America.”

But polling on the plan is strong, at least among Democrats. Data commissioned by environmental groups in early primary states found 74 percent of likely primary voters reacted favorably when presented the Green New Deal. A new Iowa poll this week reinforced that, finding 91 percent of Iowa Democrats want a candidate who supports the Green New Deal.

“If anything the Green New Deal has brought energy to an issue that had gone stale,” Mr. Whitehouse said, “and as long as we can stay united and keep making progress, it will work out really well for us.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>President Abdelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria is preparing to announce his resignation, a privately owned Algerian TV network said on Sunday, following weeks of mass protests and the army chief of staff’s call to have the president declared unfit for office.

Citing unnamed political sources, the network, Ennahar TV, reported that Mr. Bouteflika might announce his resignation on Tuesday, according to Reuters.

Also on Sunday night, Algerian national television announced that Mr. Bouteflika and Prime Minister Noureddine Bedoui had named a new government, and that it would keep Gen. Ahmed Gaïd Salah as the army chief of staff and vice defense minister.

General Gaïd Salah shocked the nation with his call last week for the Constitutional Council to set in motion a process to end Mr. Bouteflika’s 20-year presidency. Critics accused the army chief of trying to orchestrate a coup, and he suggested Saturday that unnamed figures were plotting against him as a result of his stand against Mr. Bouteflika’s presidency.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Mike Greco, who was known to connoisseurs of Italian cuisine as “the Salami King” and “the Mayor of Arthur Avenue,” and whose salumeria has catered to old neighbors, visiting politicians and insatiable Bronx expatriates for more than six decades, died on March 20 in White Plains. He was 89.

His death was confirmed by his son David. Mr. Greco, who lived in Yonkers, died in a rehabilitation center at White Plains Hospital.

A Calabrian immigrant, Mr. Greco arrived in New York in 1947 with his 17-year-old twin brother, Joe, each sporting a new suit and carrying $50. Mike went to work in a Bronx butcher shop, married the boss’s daughter and, in the early 1950s, opened a delicatessen nearby in the Arthur Avenue Retail Market, a building housing an array of merchants. His brother became the chef and owner of Joe Nina’s restaurant in the borough’s Pelham Bay section.

Mr. Greco started work at 6 a.m. seven days a week and made Mike’s Deli a place of pilgrimage in the heart of the Bronx’s Little Italy, roughly bounded in the Belmont section by Fordham Road on the north, East 181st Street on the south, Third Avenue on the west and the Bronx Zoo on the east. (The neighborhood’s most famous alumnus is probably Dion DiMucci, whose group, Dion and the Belmonts, plaintively sang in 1959, “Why must I be a teenager in love?”)</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Mr. Avenatti was released Monday evening on $300,000 bond and under several conditions, including restrictions on travel. In a brief news conference after his release, Mr. Avenatti said he was “highly confident” that when all the evidence was presented, he would be “fully exonerated, and justice will be done.”

A veteran plaintiffs lawyer, Mr. Avenatti rose to fame in March 2018 when he filed a lawsuit against Mr. Trump on behalf of Ms. Daniels, who said that she had an affair with Mr. Trump and then received a hush-money payment leading up to the 2016 election.

Mr. Avenatti became a fixture on cable news, leveraging Ms. Daniels’s case to build his own profile as a foil to Mr. Trump. He was even taken half-seriously when he declared that he was interested in making a presidential run in 2020.

Ms. Daniels’s suit, which sought to invalidate a nondisclosure agreement, was dismissed by a federal judge in California this month, and a separate defamation suit Mr. Avenatti filed against Mr. Trump on Ms. Daniels’s behalf was dismissed late last year. The discussion about Ms. Daniels, however, has remained a leading sore point for the Trump administration, as checks made out to her with the president’s signature on them were given to Congress last month by his former personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, who has pleaded guilty to federal charges.

Last September, Mr. Avenatti inserted himself into the confirmation hearings of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. The week before Justice Kavanaugh was confirmed, Mr. Avenatti announced that he had a new client, Julie Swetnick. Ms. Swetnick said that she had witnessed sexual misconduct by Justice Kavanaugh and some of his friends at high school parties in the Washington area in the early 1980s, when she was a college student in Maryland.

As Mr. Avenatti’s national profile grew, so did his legal and financial troubles.

He was arrested in Los Angeles in November on suspicion of domestic violence, which he called an effort to intimidate him, though he was not charged with a crime. His firm, formerly known as Eagan Avenatti, has repeatedly filed for bankruptcy, most recently on March 7, in Santa Ana, Calif.

The charging documents in the Nike case refer to an unnamed co-conspirator, another lawyer who worked with Mr. Avenatti. That lawyer is Mark Geragos, according to people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the continuing investigation.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The good news is that you see this supervisor for who she is. The bad news is that she is an insecure person who might be especially threatened by you, or might just be threatened in general. My advice is to step as far back from this situation as you can. You want to learn this one thing. Set as your goal to learn it. Period. Go into work like a swimmer training for the Olympics or a knight who is about to joust. Don’t think about this boss or spend even a minute more in her head. Once you have taken what you can from this place, quit your job and find another one. You will never succeed in the long run if you work under an ineffective manager. There is just no way around this fact, even if you have a decent lance and a strong horse.

I’m a 40-year-old mom who has spent the last 15 years raising my kids. Fifteen years ago I received my master’s in public policy but I haven’t worked since. I have been on several boards and done substantial volunteer work at my kids’ school. You can see where this is going. What’s the best way for me to jump back into the work force? Should I be taking unpaid internships with recent graduates or applying for entry-level work? How can I get my foot in the door in the competitive New York City environment?

I feel like the only way I’ll get noticed or hired is if someone takes a chance on me. Plus, I feel like I’m both overqualified and underqualified all at the same time. I’m also considering getting another graduate degree that can more easily lead to a job — although I’d rather not.

You have also been working in a zoo. But you don’t want to continue in this career track, I take it, because, let’s face it: Once you have gotten used to animals throwing their feces at you and throwing their food at the wall and screaming in your face every morning that you are a poopy-butt-face, well, you’d be pretty well qualified to keep on working in a zoo, or at least in your grown kids’ junior high school.

In other words, momming prepares you to be patient as hell and to keep yourself from yelling and getting bitten on the leg. Unfortunately, such preparations are good mostly for jobs that are thankless and don’t pay because — yes, this is a tautology and totally messed up — women have historically filled such jobs, and so society undervalues them completely.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>DAYTON, Ohio — Luguentz Dort overcame a hard foul and a leg injury en route to scoring 21 points Wednesday for Arizona State in a long-awaited N.C.A.A. tournament victory in Dayton, Ohio.

The 11th-seeded Sun Devils (23- 10) beat St. John’s, 74-65, and will play Buffalo on Friday in the West Region.

Arizona State earned its first N.C.A.A. win in 10 years and the Pac-12’s first tournament win in two years.

The Pac-12 was 0-3 in the tournament last season, with two teams — Arizona State and U.C.L.A. — falling in the First Four. Arizona then got knocked out in the round of 64. The Pac-12 got three teams in again this year, with Oregon and Washington joining the Sun Devils.</TEXT>

      <TITLE>N.Y. Had a Plan for a ‘Pied-à-Terre’ Tax on Expensive Homes. The Real Estate Industry Stopped It. - The New York Times</TITLE>

      <TEXT>“You do wonder who is writing it,” he added.

Legislative leaders emphasized that they were not backing off from taxing the wealthy, a fact that did appease supporters of the pied-à-terre tax. But they remained disappointed at the apparent ease with which the real estate industry was able to steer the conversation from one policy to another, demonstrating its outsize influence in Albany, even with Democrats in control.

Michael Kink, the executive director of the Strong Economy for All coalition, a group of unions and community organizations, said a pied-à-terre tax “zeros in on the global ultrarich,” while a transfer tax on expensive properties could also affect families in gentrifying areas of Brooklyn or Queens looking to sell their longtime homes.

“If I had my druthers, it would be to do the pied-à-terre tax because it does target nonresidents,” said Ron Deutsch, the executive director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a union-backed think tank.

But others said the argument for a pied-à-terre tax over a transfer tax, for the sake of political optics, proved that the latter was a better idea.

“I’m not sure what the goal of the pied-à-terre was except to say, we don’t like people coming into the city and having a house they don’t stay in all the time,” said Martha Stark, the city’s former finance commissioner.

“I know it has a little bit of appeal in that it’s taxing people who are überrich,” she said. “I just don’t see this as being a feasible and implementable tax in terms of how it was structured.”

Still, Mr. Hoylman said he would claim an increased transfer tax as a victory.

“This would never have happened last year,” when the Senate was controlled by Republicans, he said.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>In fact, the agency advised in 2016 that fluoroquinolones’ potential side effects outweighed their benefits for several common infections. Last year, it added still another warning about ruptures or tears in the aorta, a rare but serious condition for which older people are at greater risk.

Fluoroquinolones are also most implicated in the rampant, difficult-to-cure infection called C. difficile, along with an earlier antibiotic, clindamycin. C. difficile, too, occurs more frequently in older people.

Yet what class of antibiotics did the C.D.C. team determine was most commonly prescribed for older adults? Fluoroquinolones. (The most used single drug was azithromycin, marketed as Zithromax, which isn’t a quinolone.)

More troublingly, doctors often prescribe these medications unnecessarily, studies repeatedly show. Upper respiratory infections — colds, sinus infections, bronchitis — trigger most prescriptions, but those infections are typically viral, not bacterial, and thus impervious to antibiotics.

Nonetheless, a large 2017 study of older adults in Ontario found that almost half were prescribed antibiotics for nonbacterial upper respiratory infections that likely would have cleared up in a few days without them. “Patients usually get better in spite of the drugs, not because of them,” Dr. Alexander said.

As Dr. Kabbani pointed out, “when antibiotics are needed, they are lifesaving drugs.” But because they are so widely misused, with resistance such a menace, the C.D.C. has pushed for more prudent practices for consumers and for hospitals. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, similarly, is phasing in policies for wiser antibiotic use in nursing homes.

“We want patients to get antibiotics when they need them — the right drug at the right time and the right dose — and not when they don’t,” said Dr. Fleming-Dutra. Even when antibiotics prove necessary, she noted, patients may get the wrong ones or take them for too long.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>There were also internal troubles at the S.P.L.C., with dissent and concerns about its treatment of people of color. In one of the letters written by staff members, workers noted the small number of black people in leadership ranks and that many employees had observed that people of color had been “pushed out, fired, removed from positions of leadership” or had to leave “due to discrimination and a lack of opportunities.”

After Mr. Dees’s firing, the center announced a review of its workplace culture — an examination its board ultimately said would be overseen by Tina Tchen, who was chief of staff to Michelle Obama. Even before Ms. Tchen was hired, some employees suggested a review would not be enough and demanded “real leadership change.”

Mr. Cohen is one of several senior S.P.L.C. leaders to depart, or make plans to do so, this month. In addition to Mr. Dees and Mr. Cohen, Rhonda Brownstein, the center’s legal director, submitted her resignation this week. She did not respond to a request for comment.

Meredith Horton, the deputy legal director and among the highest-ranking black women in the center’s history, said this month that she, too, would leave.

In a resignation announcement, Ms. Horton, who has not responded to interview requests, wrote that there was “more work to do” to guarantee that the S.P.L.C. was “a place where everyone is heard and respected and where the values we are committed to pursuing externally are also being practiced internally.”

Mr. Cohen forwarded Ms. Horton’s resignation email to the entire staff. He wrote that executives intended to “ensure that our workplace reflects our values.”</TEXT>

His images were playful and provocative, visually stunning with an underlying sense of vulnerability, sometimes bordering on pornography, but never vulgar. They offered a glimpse into a Chinese youth subculture outsiders rarely got to see.

Mr. Ren ’s career was meteoric, and tragically brief. He took his own life in 2017 at age 29, leaving behind a body of work that is highly personal: There is no mistaking a Ren Hang photograph.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The new series takes an early turn away from naturalism, though. David (J. J. Feild), a childhood friend of Charlie’s who’s become a Hollywood star, returns to London with his wife, Sara (Piper Perabo), a famous D.J., so that their 11-year-old daughter, Gabrielle (Frankie Hervey), can settle down and get the kind of British schooling her father too fondly remembers.

David and Sara’s commitment to full-time parenting is only calf-leather deep, however, which leads to the show’s echt-sitcom contrivance: They recruit the barely employed Charlie as nanny for their holy terror of a daughter. So: “Who’s the Boss” with a washed-up British D.J. instead of a washed-up American baseball player.

And there’s a fair measure of the kind of embarrassing sitcommery this premise would lead you to expect. If you can live without seeing Idris Elba saying “I’m adorbs” to an 11-year-old girl, you can live without “Turn Up Charlie.” In addition to being regularly humiliated by the wiseacre child he has to chase around London and Ibiza, Charlie also has to endure the put-downs of his saucy auntie, Lydia (Jocelyn Jee Esien), who dispenses wisdom about romance to him and parenting to his posh white friends.

Elba is admirably committed to the drab, sentimental material (written by Georgia Lester, Victoria Asare-Archer, Laura Neal and Femi Oyeniran), and his portrayal is unfailingly gracious and warm. He’s a gung-ho, grizzled straight man, readily playing against his superheroic image. (Although Charlie is still fought over by the ladies, and there are some oddly graphic discussions of the size of his cartridge.)

One problem, though: He’s just not funny. Elba’s considerable skills in projecting menace and resolve don’t come into play and he mostly just looks genial and a little lost. With the exception of a few supporting players, like Esien and Guz Khan as Charlie’s stoner buddy, that’s a problem up and down the call sheet — reasonably talented performers with no aptitude for comedy.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>For decades, American art students have learned that the years around 1968 saw the triumph of conceptual art, process-based sculpture, environmental interventions and body-oriented performances — and only now, at half a century’s distance, are we admitting that figurative painting had its place too in the late-60s art world, especially in Western Europe. Gilles Aillaud (1928-2005) was a central actor of Narrative Figuration during Paris’s years of student revolt , as well as a set designer at Europe’s top avant-garde theaters. But “Paintings 1964-1976,” with eight coolly composed portraits of animals in zoos, is the first showcase of his works in New York since a show at Gladstone Gallery in 1982.

Aillaud and two other young painters stormed to scandalous prominence in 1965 with the collective series “Live and Let Die, or the Tragic Death of Marcel Duchamp,” which pictured the young French artists assassinating the father figure of the avant-garde. (They were also, by symbolically murdering a Frenchman who’d become an American citizen, spitting on contemporary Parisian envy of the New York School. ) By 1967 Aillaud had turned to zoos, and before and after the student uprising he painted tortoises, rhinos, porcupines and pythons under heat lamps or beside industrial pipes. In a bare blue cage we see two soporific lions, their eyes vacant, their fur painted with aloof strokes of white. Two hippopotamuses, their thick skin evenly rendered in bronze and burnt umber, float in an aquarium like corpses. The animals never do anything in these zoo paintings. They don’t even meet our gaze; they just laze about on concrete and cinder blocks. It is a stifled view, conversant with the 19th-century tradition of animalier painting, but stripped of any allegorical comfort.

Back in left-wing Paris 50 years ago, Aillaud’s silent, unconsoling art appeared as the antithesis of gestural American abstraction, offering the most alienated view of an industrial capitalist society. They may be more moving today, in an era of climate emergency, when no distinction holds between the natural the man-made. JASON FARAGO</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Michael Gielen, a probing conductor who championed contemporary music and daring opera productions, died on Friday at his home near Mondsee, Austria, east of Salzburg. He was 91.

His death was confirmed by the German broadcaster SWR.

Mr. Gielen was active mostly in Europe, and one of his most important posts was as general music director of the Frankfurt Opera, a job he held for a decade starting in 1977. There he gave the German premieres of works by Luigi Nono and Alban Berg, revived overlooked works by Ferruccio Busoni and Franz Schreker, and invited the most ambitious directors to stage standard repertory.

Working with the dramaturge Klaus Zehelein, Mr. Gielen collaborated with Jürgen Flimm, Harry Kupfer, Hans Neuenfels (including for a pivotal “Aida” in 1980) and Ruth Berghaus, who produced Wagner’s “Ring” in notably symbolic fashion.

In 1987, John Rockwell of The New York Times called the Frankfurt house “the most prominent exponent in the world of radical operatic stage direction and design.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>When the Islamic State raised its black flag over the Syrian city of Raqqa in early 2014, it began its transformation from fringe regional player to fearsome global threat. By the end of that year, it had seized large stretches of territory in Iraq and Syria, creating a rogue state the size of Britain.

Now, the last of that territory — a sliver of land along the Euphrates River in southeastern Syria — has been retaken. Thousands of fighters remain in the region, but they have gone underground, carrying out quick strikes in the region and continuing to promote their ideology worldwide.

Here are some of the major moments in the group’s evolution:

The Islamic State traces its roots to Al Qaeda in Iraq, an offshoot of the terrorist group that attacked the United States on Sept. 11, 2001. The Iraqi affiliate started an insurgency that pushed Iraq to the brink of civil war in 2006 and 2007, before it suffered defeat at the hands of American troops and local militias.

By 2013, remnants of the Qaeda affiliate had rebranded themselves the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, and had identified opportunities in Syria, which was in the third year of its civil war. The Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, an Iraqi, was the architect of the group’s push to seize territory and declare its own state.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor who joined the Democratic Party last year to crusade against President Trump, announced he would not seek the White House himself in 2020, discarding plans to mount a maverick campaign that would have tested the party’s openness to a wealthy centrist with a chameleon-like approach to partisan politics.

Mr. Bloomberg’s decision appears to reflect a recognition of the long odds he would have faced as a moderate newcomer in an unapologetically liberal party, and his own unsentimental calculus about the trade-offs involved in running. After conducting polling and other research, Mr. Bloomberg’s advisers concluded he would have a real but narrow path to the nomination — and that it could all but vanish if Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president, entered the race.

“I believe I would defeat Donald Trump in a general election,” Mr. Bloomberg wrote, in a Bloomberg News column announcing his decision. “But I am clear-eyed about the difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field.”

[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]

Though Mr. Bloomberg is aligned with Democrats on a range of issues like climate change and gun violence, he is also a proudly pro-business centrist in a party that has moved sharply to the left in its rhetoric and policy proposals. And his record on policing as mayor, as well as his generally favorable view of Wall Street, would likely have proven troublesome in a field that is establishing litmus tests on social justice and corporate power.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>To get started, I asked Ken Belson, who covers the N.F.L. for The Times, if he would team up with me to work on the piece. He was busy reporting on the efforts to resolve the matter before the N.F.L. owners’ annual meeting began in Phoenix last weekend. But he spent hours giving me an education in the politics, hierarchies and dramas that exist behind the scenes in the N.F.L.

Then I started contacting everyone I could think of: Mr. Kraft’s lawyers and communications reps, obviously, but also anyone I have seen him linked to in press stories — Michael Rubin, an owner of the Philadelphia 76ers; the rapper Meek Mill; officials at Columbia University, to which Mr. Kraft has given tens of millions; Larry King, who I heard was at least a casual friend of Mr. Kraft’s; and Mr. Kraft’s on-and-off girlfriend Ricki Lander.

That’s a short list, and not everyone called me back. But to those who did, I made a simple pitch. I wanted to tell Mr. Kraft’s story to people like me, who didn’t know much about him beyond tabloid headlines and gossip columns.

I think his friends probably decided that a feature piece written by a woman who is not a football fan could help humanize him. I landed on-the-record interviews with the current and former Patriots quarterbacks Tom Brady and Drew Bledsoe , the musicians Meek Mill and Kenny Chesney, Mr. Rubin, Mr. King and others.

Getting Mr. Brady to call me from his family ski vacation, rather than merely accepting the offer of an email interview, took a lot of pushing and cajoling. I explained to various public relations representatives that I would write in the story that Mr. Brady submitted comments over email through a Patriots spokesman, which doesn’t convey the same level of support of Mr. Kraft as getting on the phone for an actual interview. As Patriots coach Bill Belichick has said, “You get the job done or you don’t.” I did.

Access brings its own concerns. Mr. Kraft’s friends were painting a wholly sympathetic portrait, as you would expect. But I couldn’t publish a story that sanctified Mr. Kraft and ignored the fact that he needed good P.R. to avoid damaging his most cherished and valuable asset, the Patriots. Nor could I ignore the perils of the sex trade, even if his friends made a good argument that Mr. Kraft’s case was being overly amplified by Florida prosecutors .

So I stopped asking Ken Belson to join forces with me, and started begging.

Now he and Mr. Brady both know how persuasive my nagging can be .</TEXT>

      <TEXT>GENEVA — United Nations investigators said on Tuesday that hundreds of men, women and children were slaughtered and thousands driven from their homes in attacks by one ethnic group on another in the Democratic Republic of Congo last year, and that the assaults may have amounted to crimes against humanity.

The attacks took place in December near Yumbi, a town in western Congo, Ravina Shamdasani, a spokeswoman for the United Nations human rights office in Geneva, told reporters on Tuesday, citing the investigators’ report.

Ms. Shamdasani said that villagers of the Batende ethnic group, armed with hunting rifles, machetes, bows and arrows and gasoline, killed at least 535 villagers during attacks on a Banunu community. The death toll was likely to have been much higher, she added, echoing earlier United Nations reports that close to 900 people had died.

In January, United Nations investigators traveled to the region on a two-day mission and interviewed 90 people. They determined that around 19,000 people had fled the violence, about 16,000 of whom crossed the border into the neighboring Republic of Congo, Ms. Shamdasani said. The attackers also destroyed close to a thousand buildings, mostly houses but also including 14 churches, 17 schools and several health centers.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>A little more than a week after prosecutors in Florida charged Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, with soliciting prostitution, what ordinarily would be a minor case has become a legal battle involving some of the most expensive and sought-after lawyers in the country.

To lead his defense, Mr. Kraft, a billionaire friend of President Trump and one of the most powerful owners in the N.F.L., has retained William A. Burck, who was a lawyer in the George W. Bush White House and had a role in the screening of documents related to Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh’s recent Supreme Court nomination. Mr. Kraft has also hired Jack Goldberger, the Florida lawyer who defended Jeffrey E. Epstein, a wealthy New York financier accused of trafficking underage girls for sex.

Mr. Goldberger and Mr. Burck did not return calls for comment, but they could mount an aggressive defense by poking holes in video evidence that may prove that Mr. Kraft did not ask anyone for sex and by arguing that the police violated Mr. Kraft’s Fourth Amendment rights during an improper traffic stop, among other arguments.

Prosecutors in Palm Beach County, Fla., so far have taken a hard line on Mr. Kraft and the two dozen other individuals who have been accused of soliciting prostitution at the Orchids of Asia Day Spa, a massage parlor and salon in a Jupiter, Fla., strip mall about a 30-minute drive from Mr. Kraft’s home in Palm Beach. Last week, they increased the severity of the charges, from second-degree to first-degree misdemeanors.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Though the case is a minor one by legal standards, Mr. Kraft has spared no expense, bringing in sought-after lawyers, including William A. Burck, who worked in the George W. Bush White House, and Jack Goldberger, who defended Jeffrey E. Epstein, the New York financier accused of trafficking underage girls for sex.

A vigorous defense is unusual for a case of this kind. Most defendants take a plea deal, pay a fine and complete community service. They can later petition the court to expunge their record.

Legals experts say that bringing in high-powered lawyers, especially ones from out of state, is unnecessary in misdemeanor cases like the one that Mr. Kraft is fighting. It is often more effective, they say, to hire lawyers who are familiar with state court judges and state attorneys, who are elected in Florida.

“The problem with Kraft is the problem with famous people, which is they think if you bring in famous attorneys, they’ll do a better job,” said Hugh Culverhouse Jr., the son of the former owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and a former prosecutor now in private practice. “In Florida, you don’t walk into state court with an out-of-town attorney. Who are you trying to impress?”

Last week, Dave Aronberg, the state attorney overseeing the cases in Palm Beach County, said that all defendants would be treated equally, regardless of their wealth or fame.

“Our office treats everyone the same, whether you have a lot of money or are indigent,” Mr. Aronberg said last week. “No one gets special treatment in Palm Beach County.”

Mr. Aronberg, a former assistant attorney general and a Florida state senator, is a Democrat who ran unopposed when he was re-elected in 2016.

Mr. Kraft has long been associated with Democratic causes. But he is also close friends with President Trump, who has invited Mr. Kraft to fly on Air Force One and dine at his Palm Beach club, Mar-a-Lago.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The transportation secretary, Elaine L. Chao, called on Tuesday for her agency’s internal watchdog to investigate the process by which the Federal Aviation Administration in 2017 approved designs for the 737 Max. Lawmakers in Congress also are pushing for a review, while Canada is looking into its approval of the plane’s American certification.

The specific allegations that the Defense Department’s inspector general is examining revolve around complaints, first reported in Politico, that Mr. Shanahan disparaged competitors of Boeing during meetings at the Pentagon with senior national security officials and lawmakers, two United States officials said.

Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts and a member of the Armed Services Committee that would consider Mr. Shanahan’s confirmation if he is nominated, said she alerted the Pentagon’s internal watchdog after hearing that he “may have advocated on behalf of his former employer, Boeing, while serving as the acting defense secretary.”

“The American people should be able to trust that government officials are working for them — not for big defense contractors,” Ms. Warren, who is running for president, said in a statement.

While Mr. Mattis resigned in protest of Mr. Trump’s policies — including the surprise announcement that American troops would withdraw from Syria — Mr. Shanahan has held the line for the president.

As the deputy defense secretary, Mr. Shanahan made clear that “we are not the Department of No,” as he told officials after the administration announced plans to create a new stand-alone Space Force at the Pentagon. It has since been moved to the oversight of the Air Force.

Since becoming acting defense secretary, Mr. Shanahan has raised the ire of some lawmakers. Last month, Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said he did not believe Mr. Shanahan shared the “humility” of Mr. Mattis but did not elaborate. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, also clashed with Mr. Shanahan last month over the planned troop withdrawal from Syria.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Should the United States follow New Zealand’s example and ban all military-style semiautomatic weapons in an attempt to prevent future mass shootings? Or would such a ban be unconstitutional or impractical here?

In “New Zealand to Ban Military-Style Semiautomatic Guns, Jacinda Ardern Says,” Damien Cave and Charlotte Graham-McLay write:

CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand — Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand on Thursday announced a national ban on all military-style semiautomatic weapons, all high-capacity ammunition magazines and all parts that allow weapons to be modified into the kinds of guns used to kill 50 people at two mosques in Christchurch last week. “What we’re banning today are the things used in last Friday’s attack,” she said, adding: “It’s about all of us, it’s in the national interest and it’s about safety.” Ms. Ardern is expected to encounter little resistance to the weapons ban in Parliament; the largest opposition party quickly said it supported the measures. Ms. Ardern said her goal was to eliminate from New Zealand the weapons that the killer used in Christchurch. She emphasized that it would require a buyback of banned weapons in circulation now, plus regulation around firearms and ammunition. “The guns used in these terrorist attacks had important distinguishing features,” she said at a news conference at Parliament in Wellington, the capital. “First, big capacity, and also their delivery. They had the power to shoot continuously, but they also had large capacity magazines.” Ms. Ardern’s plan for immediate gun policy changes, announced six days after a mass shooting, stands in stark contrast to the stalemate and resistance to change that has stymied similar calls for restrictions on firearms in the United States. Many Americans can buy a gun in less than an hour. In New Zealand, the process can take weeks or months. Ms. Ardern’s handling of the massacre and its aftermath have resonated around the world and thrust her into the spotlight as a force on the issue of guns. The shooting in New Zealand comes after the United States has experienced an alarming number of mass shootings in recent years, including the Sandy Hook, Conn., school shooting that took 27 lives in 2012; the Orlando nightclub shooting in 2016, which killed 49; the Las Vegas concert shooting in 2017 that left 58 dead; and the Parkland, Fla., school shooting, which killed 17 people in 2018.

Ms. Ardern’s overhauls have been inspired in part by neighboring Australia’s response after a mass shooting in 1996. The article continues:

Mr. Alpers said the challenge for New Zealand would mainly be getting the ammunition and guns that already exist out of circulation. Half of Australia’s states had some kind of gun registration plan in place before the 1996 reforms, making it easier for the authorities to know what weapons were out there and what needed to be brought in. New Zealand only registers 4 percent of its weapons. According to the police, about 250,000 people in the country own an estimated 1.2 million to 1.5 million firearms. It is unclear how many of them would be affected by the ban. “New Zealand is at a considerable disadvantage to countries that have had registries, because there’s no way of tracing the firearms because they don’t know who’s got them,” Mr. Alpers said. “We’re relying entirely on the honesty of the gun owner to turn it in.” Ms. Ardern said that fair compensation would be paid to all those who participate.

Students, read the entire article, then tell us:

— What is your reaction to Prime Minister Ardern’s decision to ban semiautomatic weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines? Should the United States do the same? If not, how should our country address the issue of guns and mass shootings?

When a terrorist massacred 50 people at two New Zealand mosques last week, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern immediately grasped the nettle. “I can tell you one thing right now,” she told a news conference. “Our gun laws will change.” That’s what effective leadership looks like. New Zealand’s cabinet has now agreed in principle to overhaul those laws, experts are reviewing ways to make the country safer from firearms and, Ardern promised, “within 10 days of this horrific act of terrorism, we will have announced reforms.” Contrast that with the United States, where just since 1970, more Americans have died from guns (1.45 million, including murders, suicides and accidents) than died in all the wars in American history (1.4 million). More Americans die from guns every 10 weeks than died in the entire Afghanistan and Iraq wars combined, yet we still don’t have gun safety rules as rigorous as New Zealand’s even before the mosques were attacked.

Do you agree with Mr. Kristof? Has America lacked leadership on the issue of gun violence? How would you assess the quality of leadership by elected officials in the United States?

— New Zealand has a population of 4.6 million and an estimated 1.2 million to 1.5 million firearms. The United States has a population of 327 million people and over 300 million guns. In what ways do you think New Zealand’s weapons ban is relevant to the situation in the United States? Do you think the ban represents a realistic model of legislation that could happen here? Or are there too many obstacles or logistical issues that would make such a ban more difficult to enact?

— Additionally, the United States has an explicit amendment protecting gun rights that New Zealand does not. The Second Amendment to the Constitution reads:

However, the Library of Congress writes, “The meaning of this sentence is not self-evident, and has given rise to much commentary but relatively few Supreme Court decisions.” What do you think these words mean? What relevance should they have for the debate about guns? Do you think a ban on military-style semiautomatic weapons would be constitutional?

— In her announcement on Thursday, Ms. Ardern said, “It’s about all of us, it’s in the national interest and it’s about safety.” Do you think it is possible for the government to find a healthy balance between protecting people’s right to own a gun and public safety? Do you believe the government is currently striking the right balance? Why or why not?

      <TEXT>Of course, six is a ridiculously small number of steps, and the resulting hexagon is a crude caricature of a circle, but Archimedes was just getting started. Once he figured out what the hexagon was telling him, he shortened the steps and took twice as many of them. Then he kept doing that, over and over again.

A man obsessed, he went from 6 steps to 12, then 24, 48 and ultimately 96 steps, using standard geometry to work out the ever-shrinking lengths of the steps to migraine-inducing precision. By using a 96-sided polygon inside the circle, and also a 96-sided polygon outside the circle, he ultimately proved that pi is greater than 3 + 10/71 and less than 3 + 10/70.

Take a moment to savor the result visually:

The unknown value of pi is being trapped in a numerical vise, squeezed between two numbers that look almost identical, except the first has a denominator of 71 and the last has a denominator of 70. By considering polygons with even more sides, later mathematicians tightened the vise even further. Around 1,600 years ago, the Chinese geometer Zu Chongzhi pondered polygons having an incredible 24,576 sides to squeeze pi out to eight digits:

By allowing the number of sides in the polygons to increase indefinitely, all the way out to infinity, we can generate as many digits of pi as we like, at least in principle.

In taming infinity, Archimedes paved the way for the invention of calculus 2,000 years later. And calculus, in turn, helped make the world modern. Archimedes’s mathematical strategy is used in computer-generated movies, approximating Shrek’s smooth belly and trumpet-like ears with millions of tiny polygons. The smooth glide of an Ella Fitzgerald song is digitally represented in streaming audio by an enormous number of bits.

In every field of human endeavor, from reconstructive facial surgery to the simulation of air flowing past a jet’s wing, billions of tiny, discrete elements stand in for an inherently smooth and analog reality. It all began with the computation of pi. Pi represents a mathematical limit: an aspiration toward the perfect curve, steady progress toward the unreachable star. It exists, clear as night, with no end in sight.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Sidney Verba, whose pioneering research comparing political behavior among the world’s democracies became a classic book among students of politics, died on March 4 at his home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 86.

His death was confirmed by his wife, Cynthia Verba.

Professor Verba was also noted for directing the digital evolution of the Harvard University Library, which he led for 23 years in a parallel career while teaching at Harvard, his alma mater.

Beginning with “The Civic Culture: Political Attitudes and Democracy in Five Nations,” which he wrote with Gabriel A. Almond in 1963 when he was Dr. Almond’s research assistant at Princeton University, Professor Verba created surveys into civic participation and political inequality that challenged conventions about American exceptionalism.

“The Civic Culture” sought to find a common denominator among stable democracies by systematically comparing data from multiple nations: two established ones (the United States and Britain); two emerging from autocratic governments (Germany and Italy); and an aspiring one (Mexico).</TEXT>

      <TEXT>NEW DELHI — The planned city of Gurugram, one of India’s industrial hubs, has glass-sided office buildings and swanky, high-rise apartments. But now, according to a new report, it can claim a less desirable distinction: the city with the world’s worst air.

India holds 15 of the top 20 spots in that category, according to the report, which was released this week by Greenpeace and IQAir AirVisual, a software company that tracks air quality data. The Pakistani city of Lahore and Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, also made the top 20, making South Asia — where governments are routinely criticized for failing to limit emissions and coal use — an especially toxic region.

“At a country level, weighted by population, Bangladesh emerges as the most polluted country on average, closely followed by Pakistan and India,” the report said.

Details from the report, which looked at data from more than 3,000 cities around the world, offer more bad news for India’s nascent movement to curb air pollution. Average levels of the tiny, dangerous particles known as PM 2.5, which can penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream, were largely unchanged from 2017 to 2018 in many Indian cities featured in the report.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>It’s been four years since Anna and Matthew broke up, and the charge between them is unmistakable. Meeting in a coffee shop downtown, they are intimate, teasing, comfortable, prickly — people who were once passionately bound and maybe thought they always would be.

In their fractious moments, you can see why the relationship imploded. Still, these two are each other’s one who got away.

Directed by Knud Adams for Blockchain Theater Project, Sofia Alvarez’s “Nylon” — evidently a response, at least in part, to Ibsen’s “A Doll’s House” — is so simmeringly alive in its opening scene that we invest in these characters immediately. Anna (Sheila Vand) is a magazine editor who fled New York for London after they split up, then too swiftly married someone there. Matthew (the excellent Cesar J. Rosado) is a onetime musician who now makes rooftop gardens — a stable and lucrative occupation as he sees it, but evidence of failure in her eyes.

She is in town for a conference, and when they retire to her hotel room to talk some more, they arrive at the aching topic that has been on both their minds — Emma, the daughter they gave up as a newborn to be raised by the mother of a friend. They were in their 20s when Anna had her, and it was her choice not to keep the child. She has been running from that decision, and hating herself for it, ever since.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>NAHA, Japan — He has been called the “emperor of Japanese architecture” by his peers and “visionary” by critics. Now, the internationally renowned architect Arata Isozaki can add yet another tribute: the 2019 Pritzker Architecture Prize.

The announcement on Tuesday of architecture’s highest award was seen by many as a long overdue honor for this 87-year-old architect, urban designer and theorist, who is credited with fusing East and West, modern and postmodern, and global and local in a visually diverse body of work that symbolized Japan’s global influence. Mr. Isozaki’s more than 100 buildings include the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, the Palau Sant Jordi in Barcelona and the Qatar National Convention Center in Doha.

At his modest apartment in Naha, the capital of Okinawa, Mr. Isozaki said he was “overjoyed” to receive the prize.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“They continue to give themselves an unfair advantage at every turn,” Daniel Ek, Spotify’s chief executive, said in a message posted on the company’s website. He said Apple was acting as both &quot;player and referee to deliberately disadvantage other app developers.”

Apple did not respond to a request for comment. The company has said the fees are reasonable given that it must maintain the App Store and is providing access to millions of potential customers who own Apple devices.

Apple’s introduction of the App Store in 2008 revolutionized the mobile-phone industry, creating a new marketplace for consumers to download games, productivity tools and social networking services. There are now more than two million apps available on the App Store.

Companies like Spotify have thrived on Apple’s platform, which typically generates more money for app developers than Google’s Play Store.

Spotify’s overall sales last year rose 29 percent to 5.3 billion euros, or about $6 billion, but the company is not profitable and is under pressure from investors to improve its margins. The company paid about 74 percent of its revenue to cover music rights and related costs.

Spotify has been a formidable competitor to Apple in attracting customers for music streaming. Spotify said that it ended 2018 with 207 million active users around the world, including 96 million who were signed up for a paid subscription that did not include ads. In January, Apple said that its Apple Music service had 50 million paying users.

Apple’s control over the App Store has been an increasing source of tension as the company has focused more on online services that compete with many of the apps sold on its platform. As iPhone sales have leveled off, Apple has relied more on sales of software and services. The largest driver of that sort of revenue is the App Store.</TEXT>

The New York attorney general’s office late on Monday issued subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and Investors Bank for records relating to the financing of four major Trump Organization projects and a failed effort to buy the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League in 2014, according to a person briefed on the subpoenas.

The inquiry opens a new front in the scrutiny of Deutsche Bank, one of the few lenders willing to do business with Donald J. Trump in recent years. The bank is already the subject of two congressional investigations and was examined last year by New York banking regulators, who took no action.

The new inquiry, by the office of the attorney general, Letitia James, was prompted by the congressional testimony last month of Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s former lawyer and fixer, the person briefed on the subpoenas said. Mr. Cohen testified under oath that Mr. Trump had inflated his assets in financial statements, and Mr. Cohen provided copies of statements he said had been submitted to Deutsche Bank.

The inquiry by Ms. James’s office is a civil investigation, not a criminal one, although its focus and scope were unclear. The attorney general has broad authority under state law to investigate fraud and can fine — or in extreme cases, go to court to try to dissolve — a business that is found to have engaged in repeated illegality.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>A fifth-grade student in South Carolina has died after a fight at her elementary school this week, a devastating outcome that left her community shocked with grief and spurred a discussion about how to handle painful issues of bullying and violence in the classroom.

The student, Raniya Wright, had gotten into a fight with another fifth-grade student at Forest Hills Elementary School on Monday and collapsed, according to officials in Colleton County, about an hour west of Charleston.

Emergency workers who responded to a 911 call found Raniya “unconscious but breathing” at the school nurse’s station and rushed her to the hospital, the authorities said. By Wednesday morning, her mother said in a Facebook post, her “baby girl” had gotten her “wings.”

It was unclear what led to the fight. The other student was suspended, school officials said, and the authorities were investigating. An autopsy was scheduled for Friday.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Dear Simon Branson: Today is going to be a good day, and here’s why.

But a person could be forgiven for momentarily confusing “Superhero,” the new musical about a withdrawn teenager and his anxious mother, with “Dear Evan Hansen,” the hit musical about a withdrawn teenager and his anxious mother.

It’s not just that the boys’ names scan so similarly. Or that both shows are about fatherless families: Evan’s the result of divorce; Simon’s the result of an accident. The opening songs (“Anybody Have a Map?” in “Dear Evan Hansen” and “What’s Happening to My Boy?” in “Superhero”) have nearly identical emotional setups, including nearly identical phrases about mothers finding their way back to their sons.

More fundamentally, both “Superhero” and “Dear Evan Hansen” show how damaged people try to use stories, whether fictional or outright false, to rebuild themselves after trauma — and how they may create new traumas in the process.</TEXT>

So why are some “plays like this” quite engaging when this one is not? You can’t blame the cast members, who ride the hairpin turns of their characters with nearly convincing finesse. Nor is the subject of gun violence and its aftermath unworthy — at least when addressed, as in many recent dramas, sincerely. If only that were the case here.

But the violence in “After” feels opportunistic. Because it happens entirely offstage, and because its resolution is delivered secondhand, it makes us suspect that the play we are watching is really about something else. Exactly what is hard to say, though I think it may mean to ask what responsibility parents bear for the moral and psychological health of their children. Tate is a hothead; Julia, neurotic; Connie and Alan give helicopters a bad name. Only Val (Jolie Curtsinger) seems to be a sensible adult, so naturally her son gets into Dartmouth.

Even if those traits were persuasively related to the plot, there would be the problem of the plot itself, which is about as subtle as that deer head. It’s a drawback shared, if less detrimentally, by Mr. McKeever’s play “Daniel’s Husband,” which had Off Broadway runs in 2017 and 2018. “Daniel’s Husband,” about the problem of gay couples who lack adequate legal protection in the event of a catastrophe, was moving but manipulative; the characters were little more than chessmen arranged to produce a devastating checkmate.

Likewise here, except that “After” is moving only to the extent we may feel obliged to honor the enormous exertions of the actors trying to gin up tears. The story is too baldly engineered — too bullying, in fact — to engage the audience in the manner necessary to produce empathy.

The enervating production exacerbates the problem. Joe Brancato, who directed “After” as well as “Daniel’s Husband” after developing both at his Penguin Rep Theater in Rockland County, N.Y., seems more interested in simplifying than in complicating the play’s schematic conflicts. You could follow the action almost perfectly with the sound turned off.

Actually, that might be a good idea. The saving grace of problem play authors like Yasmina Reza (“God of Carnage,” “Art”) and Terence Rattigan (“Man and Boy,” “The Winslow Boy”) is their artful, witty dialogue, scoring points and defining characters while tickling the ear. Mr. McKeever’s dialogue sounds as if it were lifted from a concordance of morose clichés: “You think I don’t know that?” “Don’t for one second!” “And the last thing I need is. …” “Now if you’ll excuse me. …” “Never step foot in this house again.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>What do black people do, exactly, when their melanated glow is lost to winter?

Beauty questions rarely give me pause, but I wasn’t sure what to suggest when a friend showed up to dinner a few weeks ago looking much paler than usual. A passing joke — “Well, damn, Casper!” — was all I had to offer.

We chuckled, lamented her lightness and shrugged, as if to say, “Meh, what can you do?”

I considered the problem later and realized that it’s not culturally resonant for us to tan (outside of a beach vacation) or self-tan. Some black women do both, of course, but it doesn’t leap casually to the mind as a solution (and sunbathing is bad for black skin, too, to be clear). We’re not as likely to consider color as something we need because we just have it!

And of course, colorism has always been and still is a major feature of the black experience. Though many of us reject the notion that proximity to whiteness is preferable, societal racism and colorism (within and outside our community) have undoubtedly shaped our culture as it relates to skin color — and purposely darkening our skin.

We’re obviously not here for any of that in 2019, though. And so in order to not be caught off guard again on how to get a bronzed look, I consulted two experts: Cheryl Burgess, a dermatologist in the Washington, D.C., area who is black and treats many black patients; and Saisha Beecham, a makeup artist whose clients include Logan Browning, Gabby Douglas and Sanaa Lathan.</TEXT>

We welcome and encourage all voices and points of view as long as they include an openness to respectfully discussing this issue with others.

Have you, or someone close to you, been a victim of gun violence? Are you a teacher who wants to be trained to shoot, or a mother who feels more comfortable with a gun in the home? Do you collect guns, but support a national registry? We want to hear from a diversity of voices in this debate.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Mr. Hope continued, “The strange thing now is we know who killed Mum, the evidence is there and we know how it happened, but we can’t get them to face justice.” In the absence of a trial, he said, “it’s going to upset me for the rest of my life.”

At the time of the poisoning, Ms. Sturgess was living in a state-run shelter that houses people with drug and alcohol problems. Other residents spoke fondly of her, describing her as a maternal figure who propped her door open with a sock so that her friends could stop in to see her at any time.

She had been buoyed by her relationship with Mr. Rowley, who was recovering from a heroin addiction.

“I trust Charlie with my life and he gets me the best gifts ever,” she wrote on Facebook.

It was one of those gifts, a vial with a counterfeit label identifying it as Nina Ricci perfume, that killed her.

Ms. Sturgess is believed to have sprayed the substance on the inside of her wrist on July 1. A friend who was with Ms. Sturgess and Mr. Rowley said that their condition rapidly deteriorated. Ms. Sturgess lived for a week after her exposure.

Her family said little at the time, but expressed anger as the anniversary of the poisoning approached.

Her mother, Caroline, recalled that she was allowed to touch her dying daughter only if she was wearing protective gloves. At one point, she said, she reached up to wipe away a tear and was warned by an official not to touch her own face.

Her son, Mr. Hope, also recalled touching her as she lay in the hospital.

“I touched her hair through the gloves and told her: ‘I love you, Mum. I just want you to get better,’” he told The Mirror before she died. “I’m worried I’m going to lose my mum.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Virginia officials asked the Supreme Court to review that ruling, noting that the state’s Supreme Court had come to the opposite conclusion on the legal question in the case.

The United States Supreme Court also agreed to decide whether the Constitution allows non-unanimous verdicts in criminal cases.

The case, Ramos v. Louisiana, No. 18-5924, concerns Evangelisto Ramos, a Louisiana man who was convicted in 2016 for killing a woman in New Orleans. The jury’s vote was 10 to 2, which was enough under the state’s law at the time. Louisiana has since amended its state Constitution to bar non-unanimous verdicts, but the move came too late to help Mr. Ramos.

Oregon is the last remaining state that allows non-unanimous verdicts in criminal cases.

In a pair of decisions in 1972, one each from Oregon and Louisiana, the Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution does not require states to insist on unanimity. Critics say the decisions ignored the historical record and made assumptions about jury behavior that have been called into question by more recent research.

The court also agreed to decide whether states may abolish the dominant version of the insanity defense. The case concerns James Kahler, who was sentenced to death for killing four family members. His lawyers said he suffered “from depression so severe that he experienced extreme emotional disturbance, dissociating him from reality.”

“Although he knew that he was shooting human beings,” Mr. Kahler’s lawyers said of their client, “his mental state was so disturbed at the time that he was unable to control his actions.”

Kansas is one of five states in which defendants cannot avoid criminal punishment by showing that their mental illness prevented them from knowing their actions were wrong. In their petition seeking review in the case, Kahler v. Kansas, No. 18-6135, lawyers for Mr. Kahler wrote that the state’s approach “defies a fundamental, centuries-old precept of our legal system: People cannot be punished for crimes for which they are not morally culpable.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>LONDON — Britain can be an insular place. A parlor game here involves trying to list as many famous Belgians as possible, on the basis that few people know any. An equivalent exercise with French rappers would be even tougher. France is one of the world’s largest rap music markets, but its neighbor on the other side of the English Channel pays little attention.

The lack of interest is reciprocated. French rap is full of borrowed English words: The F-bomb is often detonated in lyrics, especially in “le rap hard-core.” But the prevailing influence is American; British rappers struggle to command attention. Stormzy, probably Britain’s highest-profile M.C., topped the British charts when he released his debut album in 2017. In France, he did not even make the top 200.

Can the differences between these opposing citadels of European rap be bridged? The answer lies not just in Britain and France, but also in Europe’s former colonies in Africa.

West and Central Africa contain numerous English- and French-speaking nations that reflect the presence of Britain, France and Belgium as colonial powers until the 1960s. Imported styles of pop music from sub-Saharan Africa have been adopted and transformed by British and French musicians who have roots there.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>HALF MOON BAY, Calif. — See if you can get to the end of this article without being interrupted by another piece of technology.

Tristan Harris, a former Google executive, said it could be a challenge, and he compared phones and apps to slot machines that command attention and endlessly distract.

In an unusual twist, Mr. Harris discussed electronic addiction at the recent New York Times New Work Summit on a stage set with candles, as the electricity in the Half Moon Bay area had gone out.

When Mr. Harris worked at Google in 2013, he created a 141-page slide show that acted as a reckoning for the internet giant. What was first shared with around 10 colleagues was later viewed by tens of thousands of employees and others.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>For watches that can go underwater, salt water and chlorine can be corrosive, so a rinse in clean water after a swim is also advised by many brands.

Other sports could also create problems: Cartier’s watch care instructions advise against sports like golf or tennis — presumably in part because of sweating, although it doesn’t specify, as well as exposure to extreme temperatures.

At-home ultrasonic cleaners — the machines that clean dirt from items like jewelry with water or a liquid solvent and ultrasonic waves — typically aren’t suitable for most timepieces. (Some cleaners can work for truly waterproof watches, or for metal bracelets that have been detached from a timepiece; it’s key to follow each machine manufacturer’s directions.) Ultrasonic cleaners cannot be used to clean smartwatches; care directions for the Apple Watch, for example, recommend avoiding such machines, as well as soap, cleaning products or anything abrasive, but say the model can be cleaned with a damp cloth or even a small splash of water.

Specialists say that keeping a watch away from anything that could leech through its case is advisable as well, especially if it’s vintage. “You don’t want to expose it to perfumes, or hand creams, or any greasy substance that may intrude onto the dial and soil it — by that, I mean leave a stain,” said Edward Faber, the co-founder and chief executive of the Aaron Faber Gallery, a boutique in midtown Manhattan that cleans and repairs watches, and sells mostly vintage ones. “Many of these watches, especially the earlier ones before 1980, are not completely hermetic, so that oil or cream could seep into it.”

When they are not being worn, watches should be stored much like fine jewelry: away from anything that could scratch them and, ideally, in a case with a soft interior surface.

Mr. Surratt keeps his collection in a Hermès woven-leather-covered watch box, which has interior compartments lined in supple suede (it was a gift). Wolf, a company that has specialized in jewelry and watch boxes since 1834, offers a wide selection of cases with internal divisions, starting at around $50. The small pouches that high-end brands use to return watches after they have been repaired — Patek Philippe’s, for instance, are soft brown leather with a suede interior — are also an option, as are the boxes that watches come in at purchase.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The media frenzy over Will Burrard-Lucas’s stunning photos of a rare black leopard in Kenya underscores the world’s fascination with these mysterious creatures.

While the conservation community weighs whether the new data actually serves as the first evidence of a black leopard in Africa in a century (at least half a dozen others have been reported), we are missing a more important point: All leopards are increasingly rare, having lost 75 percent of their historical range, and several subspecies in Southeast Asia hover at extinction.

I hope that these exceptional sightings provoke not just a viral media moment, but also a movement to protect and preserve these magnificent animals that so capture our imagination.

      <TEXT>If literary realism attempts to hold a mirror to the world, then Leila Aboulela’s “Elsewhere, Home” is an especially vivid reflection in a pond, as accurate as glass’s gaze but rippled to capture life as a thing shivering and fluid even when seemingly still.

Born in Cairo, Aboulela grew up in Sudan and is now living in Scotland. “Elsewhere, Home” encompasses some of her earliest work from the late ’90s through to her most recent, and 11 out of the 13 entries have been published before. And yet there is a freshness here, in part due to the scarcity of Muslim European voices in America.

But the force of Aboulela’s writing exceeds its representational significance: She animates so many well-rounded characters who not only honor, but also dare to challenge, the cultures they come from. There are no simple bad-good, European-Muslim dichotomies here. Each individual portrait — and the book operates best as a study in portraiture — is complex, but not gratuitously so. These intricacies of bicultural families and friendships carry a delicate strength that doesn’t just resemble life, it is life, for readers who believe more in the shifting pond reflection than in the static mirror image.

One marvels at a sort of uniformity in this quiet collection that transcends theme, setting, subject. Critics sometimes speak of writers as having “found their voices,” but this book is a testament to one who’s always had hers. Moving gracefully between scenes, that consistent voice familiarizes us with not just the characters, but the author herself.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>NAHA, Japan — He has been called the “emperor of Japanese architecture” by his peers and “visionary” by critics. Now, the internationally renowned architect Arata Isozaki can add yet another tribute: the 2019 Pritzker Architecture Prize.

The announcement on Tuesday of architecture’s highest award was seen by many as a long overdue honor for this 87-year-old architect, urban designer and theorist, who is credited with fusing East and West, modern and postmodern, and global and local in a visually diverse body of work that symbolized Japan’s global influence. Mr. Isozaki’s more than 100 buildings include the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, the Palau Sant Jordi in Barcelona and the Qatar National Convention Center in Doha.

At his modest apartment in Naha, the capital of Okinawa, Mr. Isozaki said he was “overjoyed” to receive the prize.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>As befits a show about the Temptations, the most infectiously rhythmic of chart-topping R&amp;B groups, “Ain’t Too Proud” keeps time in style. I don’t mean that solely in terms of a beat that makes you feel like dancing.

Of course, as you watch this latest entry in Broadway’s ever-expanding jukebox musical sweepstakes, you will no doubt find your legs twitching, as if from muscle memory. That’s the urge being translated with such sublime grace by those five natty men on the stage, Platonic ideals of stepping high and looking fine.

But it is also true that time, unforgiving and unstoppable, is cannily presented as the shaping element in “Ain’t Too Proud: The Life and Times of the Temptations,” which opened on Thursday under the shrewd direction of Des McAnuff, with sensational choreography by Sergio Trujillo. As the show charts the changing fortunes of men who became synonymous with Motown’s glory days, the years keep moving forward with the relentlessness of a conveyor belt in an auto-making assembly line.

[Read about Cholly Atkins, the real-life choreographer for the Temptations.]

It’s enough to wear a strong man down. And more than any of the (oh so many) pop-songbook shows that have befallen Broadway since the Abba-spouting behemoth “Mamma Mia!” opened in 2001, “Ain’t Too Proud” is a story of attrition. We watch as the core lineup of the original Temptations is whittled down to the last man standing. That’s the group’s leader and show’s narrator, Otis Williams, played with anchoring gravity by Derrick Baskin.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“I don’t think the split is as much between progressives and more conservative Democrats,” Mr. Green said. “I actually think the bigger split is between Democrats who just ran and had competitive races in 2018 and a bunch of old-timers who didn’t experience the dynamic of 2018 and are still operating in yesteryear, where Medicare for all was seen as more of a fringe position.”

Many Democrats focused their election campaigns around protecting people with pre-existing conditions, and they want to move quickly to votes on proposals to do that — in part to test Republicans who made similar pledges during their campaigns. The full House has yet to vote on legislation on pre-existing conditions, though in the first 10 days of the new Congress, it voted twice to intervene in a lawsuit that threatens to eliminate the Affordable Care Act’s protections for people with such conditions.

The three House committees with jurisdiction over health care — Energy and Commerce; Ways and Means; and Oversight and Reform — have channeled their energies into numerous hearings on how to lower prescription drug costs, how to expand coverage and protect people with pre-existing conditions and how to override actions by the Trump administration.

Legislation is coming. Democrats are considering restricting the sales of short-term insurance policies, approved by the Trump administration, that do not have to comply with the Affordable Care Act, which means they do not have to provide essential health benefits and can discriminate against those with pre-existing conditions. Democrats are also looking for ways to cooperate with Republicans on proposals to lower prescription drug prices and to outlaw tactics used by brand-name companies to delay competition from generics.

Hearings on Medicare for all will begin as early as April, according to Representative Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington, who is leading the push for the Medicare for All Act.

Under the bill sponsored by Ms. Jayapal and Ms. Dingell, the secretary of health and human services would establish a “national health budget,” specifying the total amount to be spent each year, and a national fee schedule for health care providers. Republicans have recently been demanding hearings on it, in the belief that they can score political points by showing that the proposal would be immensely expensive and disruptive.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>A new round of labor upheaval hit the classical music world on Sunday night, when the musicians of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, one of the finest ensembles in the nation, went on strike in an effort to preserve their defined-benefit pension plan.

The players — who are among the best-paid in the field, earning a minimum annual salary of $159,000 last season, and often more — began walking a picket line outside Orchestra Hall on Monday morning.

In recent years, ticket sales have covered an ever-smaller portion of the cost of putting on classical performances. That has put pressure on orchestras to raise more money from donors — but also to try to cut expenses, leading to tensions with their unions. This fall, the Lyric Opera of Chicago’s orchestra went on a brief strike and wound up agreeing to a contract guaranteeing fewer weeks of work. Two seasons ago, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Pittsburgh Symphony and the Fort Worth Symphony found themselves on strike simultaneously.

There are several areas of dispute in the negotiations in Chicago, which have gone on for 11 months without an agreement, but the pension is the main sticking point. The orchestra’s management and board have warned that the growing expense of the current pension plan, which guarantees a set benefit for life after retirement, is unsustainable. They said in a statement that the orchestra contributed $3.8 million into the musicians’ pension fund this year — up from $803,000 just two years ago because of new federal requirements — and that those annual contributions were projected to continue rising sharply.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Daniel K. Elwell, acting administrator of the Federal Aviation Authority, originally said the Boeing 737 Max 8 plane would continue to fly because there were no known “systemic performance issues ” (other than the fact that two of the same type of plane crashed within six months of each other ). It is exactly for that reason that you don’t allow the planes to fly. The prudent thing to do would be to act on the side of caution and ground the planes.

Let’s face it. The main reason the planes were not grounded sooner is that Boeing is an American company and the Trump administration was greatly concerned about the financial hit to the economy that would inevitably follow. There was no concern about passenger safety . Mr. Trump views everything in terms of the bottom line. He always has and he always will.

As a lifelong safety engineer, I am horrified by the events leading President Trump and the F.A.A. to finally ground the 737 Max 8 fleet.

The relationship of the regulatory oversight guaranteeing the safety of travel and the companies involved — the regulated — represents a failure to establish and maintain an adequate safety culture.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Investigators at the crash site of the doomed Ethiopian Airlines flight have found new evidence that points to another connection to the earlier disaster involving the same Boeing jet.

The evidence, a piece of the Boeing 737 Max 8 jet that crashed in Ethiopia last weekend killing 157 people, suggests that the plane’s stabilizers were tilted upward, according to two people with knowledge of the recovery operations. At that angle, the stabilizers would have forced down the nose of the jet, a similarity with the Lion Air crash in October.

Although the crash investigations are still in the early phases, the new evidence potentially indicates that the two planes both had problems with a newly installed automated system on the 737 Max jet intended to prevent a stall.

This evidence ultimately contributed to American regulators’ decision to ground the 737 Max this week, according to the two people who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The Federal Aviation Administration said it had found physical evidence from the Ethiopian crash that, along with satellite tracking data, suggested similarities between the two crashes.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Study art history, make your rounds of the galleries, and you can quickly develop your taste — but if you truly want to understand art today, master the tax laws. Under Section 170 of the Internal Revenue Code, a collector can take hefty deductions by moving art from a personal collection to a private museum, and the last decade has seen a flare-up of single-collector art institutions like the Broad and the Marciano Art Foundation, in Los Angeles; Glenstone, outside Washington; and the newly opened Brant Foundation, in the East Village.

Now comes J. Tomilson Hill — a veteran of Lehman Brothers and the Blackstone Group, and a trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art — whose net worth of about $1.4 billion includes several hundred million dollars in art. The financier has been forthright about the tax advantages of his new Hill Art Foundation, housed on two floors of a Chelsea tower: “I can shelter capital gains,” he said in an interview with The New York Times in 2016 . He’s also been outspoken about his desire to share his collection (from which he almost never sells), which uncommonly includes both contemporary art and Renaissance bronzes.

The foundation's inaugural show, “Maybe Maybe Not,” presents more than a dozen paintings, works on paper and photographs by Christopher Wool, the painter who wrenched abstraction into the No Wave era. In a stenciled painting from 1989 , the drippy black letters of the word SPOKESMAN are arranged three by three, filling the white aluminum background with the same deductive logic as Frank Stella’s early stripes. After making layered, silk-screened floral patterns in the 1990s, Mr. Wool became more gestural; three extraordinary paintings here from the 2000s, with cloudy spray-gun loop-de-loops and merciless erasures, exhibit a simultaneous love and doubt of abstraction that recalls the best of Albert Oehlen. His enthrallingly difficult later silk-screens cannibalize his own archive, discordantly remixing earlier works and treating paint as both material and information.

Single collectors have founded some of this country’s greatest museums: the Frick, the Gardner, the Barnes, the Getty. And money’s nice, too, though it does not occupy Mr. Wool. The most radical work of art in this exhibition, sitting on a conference table upstairs, is a recent issue of the German newspaper Die Welt, for which Mr. Wool replaced every single editorial image with his resolute, speechless whorls of gray and red. You could buy one for $3. JASON FARAGO</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Good Friday morning. Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today.
• Internal memos reveal that President Trump ordered his chief of staff to grant Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser, a top-secret security clearance last year, overruling concerns from intelligence officials. The memos contradict statements made by the president, who told The Times in January that he had no role in Mr. Kushner’s clearance.

      <TITLE>Seatbelts Required in the Back Seat? This and Other Surprises in Cuomo’s Budget - The New York Times</TITLE>

      <TEXT>The new budget would reduce state funding to hospitals by more than $500 million — a gross loss of more than $1 billion after the loss in federal matching funds, according to Bea Grause, president of the Healthcare Association of New York State.

Overall healthcare spending would still rise by $200 million.

Still, advocates said the budget would make the biggest cuts to hospital spending since Mr. Cuomo took office. But Ms. Grause said she was confident her group could talk the cuts down.

“It’s the opening play in a larger negotiation,” she said.

If this sounds somewhat familiar, that’s because it is. Mr. Cuomo last year signed a law requiring opioid manufacturers and distributors to pay into a $100 million annual fund, which would be used to pay for substance abuse treatment programs.

But in December, a state judge shot that down, ruling that the law as written would obstruct interstate commerce.

So this year, Mr. Cuomo is trying again. This time, he is structuring the fee as a tax rather than a fund, and more important, explicitly allowing manufacturers to pass the cost on to patients — a provision that last year’s law prohibited.

That has raised concerns about hurting people who genuinely need the medication. “The proposed tax is effectively a tax on pain,” said Lewis Davis, an economics professor at Union College who studied the proposal at the request of a group of pharmaceutical research companies.

But Senator Peter Harckham, the Democratic chairman of the Senate’s Committee on Alcoholism and Substance Abuse, said he supported the change as a necessary concession to the goal of fighting the opioid epidemic.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>With Connecticut struggling on offense, Crystal Dangerfield took over.

Dangerfield, the Huskies’ junior guard, scored 11 of her 15 points in the fourth quarter, 9 of them during a game-changing spurt that started the period, and No. 2 seed UConn went on to beat sixth-seeded U.C.L.A., 69-61, on Friday night in the Albany Region semifinals. Napheesa Collier led the Huskies with 25 points and 10 rebounds.

“I don’t think there’s anything that came easy, from the very opening tip,” UConn Coach Geno Auriemma said. “It was a struggle.”

He added: “We had to work really, really hard for everything we got. There was a tremendous amount of pressure on our guys to make plays. Every pass was contested. Every cut was contested. Every shot was difficult to come by. There were a lot of opportunities in the second half because we only played four and a half players, so to speak. We just found a way somehow when we really needed to make some shots.”

Trailing by 50-49 entering the fourth quarter, the Huskies scored the first 6 points of the run. Dangerfield had a nifty lefty-handed layup high off the glass during the spurt.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>PARIS — French security forces fanned out across Paris and other cities on Saturday as the country faced a 19th weekend of “Yellow Vest” demonstrations, following a surge of violence last week that caught the authorities by surprise after months of dwindling numbers and calmer protests.

Though sporadic clashes erupted late in the day, violence dropped on Saturday as protesters marched peacefully in the French capital and elsewhere.

Nearly 6,000 police officers were out on the streets of Paris, especially around the Champs-Élysées and the Arc de Triomphe, which have become the focus of protests and where the authorities this past week banned demonstrations.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>No matter how big your bed is, sharing that space with someone else can make it feel cramped.

Joy Osmanski lives in a one-room loft in downtown Los Angeles and shares a bed with her husband as well as their two toddlers. Depending on how everyone is sleeping, the California-king mattress can feel like it shapeshifts. “There are some nights when the bed feels enormous, where literally, I’m like, ‘Where are you?’” Ms. Osmanski said. “Other nights, I can’t even wedge myself in.”

Ms. Osmanski’s situation may be unique, but sharing a bed with at least one other person is common. A 2012 National Sleep Foundation poll conducted with 1,004 Americans aged 25 to 55 years old found that 63 percent of respondents slept with a partner. A 2014 FiveThirtyEight survey of 1,057 American adults with a partner reported that less than 20 percent of respondents slept separately a few times a week or more.

Wendy Troxel, a senior behavioral and social scientist at the RAND Corporation, noted that although studies show that people sleep better alone, those same participants say that they preferred to sleep with a partner. “What this suggests to me is that the psychological benefits that we get from feeling close and protected and connected to our partner, particularly at night, trumps even those objective consequences of sharing a bed,” Dr. Troxel said.

The comforts of being close to a partner during sleep don’t have to come at the expense of getting a solid night’s rest. Here are some solutions for common crowded-bed complaints, from duvet tug-of-war matches to early-rising kid invasions.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“And it looked like this: 10 feet wide, 13 and 1/2 feet tall. It’d construct itself to be a 12-foot finished wall, just like that.” That’s Representative Steve King — “We do that with livestock all the time.” — pitching the idea of building a wall between the U.S. and Mexico, more than a decade before it became President Donald Trump’s central immigration policy. “The wall’s going to get built folks, just in case anybody has any question. The wall’s going to get built.” King has been a Republican member of Congress from Iowa for the past 16 years. “The gentleman from Iowa is recognized.” He’s made a name for himself as a hard-line opponent of illegal immigration and for his inflammatory, sometimes racist, statements — “We are the immigrants!” — like when he disparaged so-called “Dreamers,” children brought by their parents as undocumented immigrants, in 2013. “For every one who’s a valedictorian, there’s another hundred out there that — they weigh 130 pounds and they’ve got calves the size of cantaloupes because they’re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert.” King was an early and fervent supporter of Donald Trump. “He’s a quick study. He’s an astute study. And if you explain something to Donald Trump, he’s listening carefully, and you need to get it right.” And the feeling has been mutual. “He may be the world’s most conservative human being.” [cheering] Trump’s election in 2016 gave King a staunch ally in the White House. These days, the president’s statements sound like echoes of things King said years earlier. “It’s our job, here in this Congress, to decide who will be citizens, not someone in a foreign country that can sneak into the United States and have a baby and then go home with a birth certificate.” King’s ideas and public statements, which once seemed fringe, now appear in the national discourse. His views are central to the white identity politics that heavily influence the Trump administration. The Iowa congressman’s ultra-conservative ideas have been a long time in the making. “Preventing babies to be — from being born is not medicine. That’s not constructive to our culture and our civilization. If we let our birth rate get down below the replacement rate, we’re a dying civilization. And right now —” King has denied that his statements are racist and often invokes the idea of protecting our civilization. It’s a concept of national identity and racial superiority that’s a common talking point among white nationalists. In an interview on MSNBC, King himself explained. “Where did any other subgroup of people contribute more to civilization?” “Than white people?” “Than Western civilization itself, that’s rooted in Western Europe, Eastern Europe and the United States of America and every place where the footprint of Christianity —” “What about Africa?” “— settled the world.” “What about Asia?” “That’s all of Western civilization.” “But what about Africa? And what about Asia?” He’s even gotten close to white nationalists outside of the U.S., appearing with far-right Dutch politician Geert Wilders. King has also been to Austria several times since 2013, where he’s cozied up to the far-right Freedom Party. Back at home, King has been re-elected eight times and is considered a party kingmaker in Iowa. But the 2018 midterms were his toughest contest yet. He won by just three points. And days before the election, a member of his own party called King out as a white supremacist. After more than a decade in Congress, his rhetoric may be finally catching up with him.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Tejshree Thapa, a human rights lawyer who helped to expose the scope of mass rapes in the war-torn Balkans and South Asia and to build the legal arguments for the prosecution of those rapes as crimes against humanity, died on Tuesday in Manhattan. She was 52.

Her family said she died at Mount Sinai Hospital of multiple organ failure.

Ms. Thapa, who was born in Nepal and based in The Hague, had spent 11 years, including the last nine, as a senior researcher with the nongovernmental organization Human Rights Watch. In 2017, she was among the first human rights workers to travel to the Bangladesh-Myanmar border and document the Myanmar military’s ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims.

She made her mark in the 1990s as an investigator with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. She headed a unit that investigated mass rape and sexual enslavement in Bosnia and Herzegovina and helped win the landmark Foca cases, named for the Bosnian town where sexual crimes were committed against Muslim women in 1992 and 1993.

Her work resulted in the convictions and imprisonment of eight Serb paramilitary leaders and their supporters. The Foca convictions upheld a precedent set in 1998 by a similar tribunal after the Rwandan genocide, which established rape as a crime against humanity, and they expanded the definition of crimes against humanity to include “sexual enslavement.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>As the investigation continues into the fatal crash of a 737 Max 8 in Ethiopia on Sunday, regulators in China and Indonesia are grounding the planes, and some airlines in other countries are voluntarily pulling their fleets from service.

In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration, which certified the latest version of Boeing’s best-selling jet as airworthy in 2017, has not taken that step despite mounting questions about the plane’s safety record. The agency released a memo, known as a Continued Airworthiness Notification to the International Community, on Monday night that made no mention of plans to ground 737 Max planes.

Robert W. Mann, an airline industry consultant in Port Washington, N.Y., described what a grounding entails and the factors regulators consider when making the decision to order one. His responses have been condensed and edited for clarity.

A grounding occurs when the relevant safety regulator (the F.A.A. in the United States, or the European Aviation Safety Agency in Europe) removes the airworthiness certificate for a certain kind of plane. Effectively that makes those airplanes unusable in that jurisdiction, and also in other jurisdictions that have accepted a particular regulator’s authority.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Representative Lloyd Doggett, the Texas Democrat who questioned Mr. Mnuchin on the tax issue, found the response to be unpersuasive.

“What he said today was little more than mumble jumble double talk,” Mr. Doggett said after the hearing.

The Ways and Means chairman, Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, says his staff is working closely with the House general counsel, Doug Letter, to prepare documentation to make a request in the coming weeks. But as Democrats anticipate a legal challenge from the Treasury Department, he has been exceedingly tight-lipped about even his most basic plans.

Democrats argue that the law’s intent does, in fact, support requesting the president’s tax information, and held a hearing last month in part to bolster that interpretation. The provision in question, they point out, was born out of the Teapot Dome scandal of Warren G. Harding’s administration and aided another congressional committee in an investigation of President Richard M. Nixon’s tax positions in the 1970s.

Though the law does not require the chairman produce a rationale for a given request, Democrats believe it will help bolster their case in an eventual legal fight. In addition to the public hearing, Mr. Neal has asked other House committees to give him their own reasoning for why the documents are relevant to Congress’s work.

But the deliberative approach taken by Mr. Neal, a veteran Democrat who prefers striking legislative deals to the flash of oversight battles, has drawn the ire of liberal activists and some members of his own caucus who do not understand why he has not yet filed a request. They have tried to push Mr. Neal toward making a longer list of demands and to do so quickly — though their effect is uncertain.

Mr. Neal has repeatedly declined to answer key questions about what he will seek, including how many years worth of Trump returns he will request and whether he will try to obtain tax information on Mr. Trump’s myriad businesses.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“I understand the concern,” he said, citing the Boston University study. But he said more attention should be paid to the work that is being done to make the sport safer since the “knuckle-dragging days” when “you would hit hit hit, and run until you were puking” during practice.

He said his team had invested in new equipment, like foam tires that minimize player contact during practices, and introduced shoulder-tackling techniques developed by U.S.A. Football.

Mr. Stanton acknowledged that he might not be as influential as the Patriots’ head coach, Bill Belichick, adding that he is not “a political guy.”

“But,” he said, “I’ll definitely be calling my rep to let him know how I feel.”

In recent years, tackle football has lost some of its luster among middle and high schoolers, and their parents. In 2017, about 2.4 million athletes from ages 6 to 17 regularly played the sport, down slightly from the year before, according to the Sports &amp; Fitness Industry Association. Rugby is gaining popularity because its tackling techniques appear less risky, which increasingly appeals to coaches who are leery of concussions.

There have been moves in some parts of the country to further address player safety for tackle football at the high school level. This month, the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association adopted new guidelines intended to sharply reduce the amount of contact allowed during high school practices.

But several efforts last year to pass statewide legislation governing youth leagues were quashed by grass-roots movements led by parents and coaches.

When Assemblywoman Valerie Vainieri Huttle of New Jersey proposed banning tackle football for children under 12, parents, coaches and players threatened to vote her out of office, she said in an email.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>But perhaps the most damaging leak of all was discovered around the time of Mr. Martin’s arrest in August 2016, when a mysterious group calling itself the Shadow Brokers announced an online auction of a long list of software exploits the N.S.A. used to break into foreign computer networks. The Shadow Brokers eventually made the stolen cyberweapons public, and other countries and criminal groups began using them for hacking and theft around the world.

F.B.I. investigators focused on Mr. Martin after getting a tip from Kaspersky Lab, a Russian cybersecurity company. Two Kaspersky employees had gotten cryptic messages from Mr. Martin — calling himself “HAL999999999” — via Twitter that seemed to be offering secrets, as Politico first reported in January. The assistance was a bit ironic, because American intelligence officials have sometimes accused Kaspersky of being too close to Russian intelligence, charges the company denies.

“Shelf life, three weeks,” Mr. Martin wrote in one of his cryptic texts, seeming to suggest that he was offering material on a time-limited basis. But shortly after sending the messages, he blocked on Twitter the two Kaspersky employees he had just contacted, so they could not respond.

The F.B.I. quickly linked the HAL999999999 Twitter account to Mr. Martin, and agents were soon searching his modest house in Glen Burnie, a Baltimore suburb. They discovered a staggering total of 50 terabytes of government data, a virtual library’s worth, much of it classified at a high level.

Investigators at first believed Mr. Martin might be the Shadow Brokers, who had posted their first announcement of their auction of N.S.A. hacking tools a half-hour after Mr. Martin blocked the two Kaspersky workers on Twitter. They found the same N.S.A. exploits in Mr. Martin’s vast collection of stolen material.

But the Shadow Brokers continued to post taunting manifestoes and stolen software for months after Mr. Martin was jailed. It appears that the investigators eventually concluded that Mr. Martin was not the source of the Shadow Brokers’ material, at least not wittingly.

Government officials have never charged anyone in the Shadow Brokers breach, and speculation has centered on two possible perpetrators: Russian intelligence or disgruntled N.S.A. insiders. If F.B.I. and N.S.A. security officers have made progress in solving the case, they have not said anything about it in public.

According to court filings, Mr. Martin first agreed to plead guilty in January 2018. But negotiations subsequently fell apart, and the plea came more than a year after it was first expected. Mr. Martin has been incarcerated since his arrest, and the two and a half years he has served will be counted toward his sentence.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>SEOUL, South Korea — North Korean officials returned to work at a joint inter-Korean liaison office on Monday, just three days after North Korea pulled its staff members from the office it has operated with South Korea since last September.

North Korea abruptly withdrew workers from the liaison office, located in the North Korean border town of Kaesong, last Friday, raising fears that its was hardening its position toward the South weeks after the summit meeting between its leader, Kim Jong-un, and President Trump, ended without a deal.

But several North Korean officials showed up in the office on Monday, telling their South Korean counterparts that they have returned to work “as usual,” the South’s Ministry of National Unification said in a statement. The North Koreans returned to the office two days after Mr. Trump tweeted that he had ordered his government to withdraw “additional large scale sanctions” against the North, though it was not clear whether the two moves were connected.

The unification ministry said it expected the operation of the inter-Korean official to return to normal. But the North Koreans did not explain why they withdrew from the office on Friday, or why it then reversed its decision.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>An intractable minority of humans are filled with hate, resentment and a will to do harm to those they perceive as different. Nothing is likely to change that core malignancy. Yet the modern world gives those intent on harm the tools to carry out their deeds and the means to recruit and incite others to the same — a billion guns, a worldwide system of instant, unlimited communication through the internet, and leaders who gain power by stoking hate and differences, leaders such as President Trump.

There is no way to stop these increasing outbreaks until all nations decide for the common good and survival of humanity to severely regulate or even ban guns; to limit internet speech that incites violence and hatred; and to reject overwhelmingly candidates whose core message elevates one people over another. Attempts to identify likely perpetrators and keep guns out of their hands are as foolhardy as attempts to kill or imprison all of the terrorists.

Regarding Charlie Warzel’s opinion piece about the shooter’s video of the New Zealand massacre going viral (nytimes.com, March 15):

I must admit that I am of two minds about the rapid viral spread of video of a mass shooting and attempts to stop its distribution. On the one hand, it is horrible that someone can not only commit such senseless snuffing of lives but also record the horror in real time, so that others can experience the suffering and terror and be traumatized at a remove.

But — and I realize this likely won’t be a popular viewpoint — should we so quickly attempt to censor and muzzle such recordings? Should they not be there to remind us of the depths to which we can sink, and to remind us what we’re up against? Should we not be able to view it in the same way we view pictures and video taken of the World War II concentration camps, so we can all bear witness and never forget?</TEXT>

      <TEXT>NEW DELHI — When an Indian fighter pilot who had been captured by Pakistan was released on Friday, it capped a humiliating episode for India and a surreal week for him.

First the pilot, Wing Cmdr. Abhinandan Varthaman, was soaring through the sky in a MiG-21 on Wednesday. Then he was shot down by Pakistani forces.

After parachuting into enemy territory and being surrounded by a mob, he tried to eat some of the documents he was carrying, according to Indian news media reports. He was then badly beaten before being rescued by Pakistani troops.

But that wasn’t the end of it. Over the next few days, videos of him being interrogated in Pakistani custody spread on social media around the world.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>We at Day One agree with Andrea Barrica ’s assessment of sex education. Teaching students about consent, teenage dating violence and bodily autonomy is critical to prevent abusive and coercive relationships.

While statistics vary, nationally nearly 1 in 11 female teenagers and about 1 in 15 male teenagers experienced physical dating violence within the last year. In New York, about 1 0 percent of t eenagers reported experiencing physical dating violence.

New York has the chance to pass a bill that for the first time would mandate statewide, medically accurate health education teaching consent, the intersection of technology and dating violence, and other related topics.

Day One assists young people 24 and younger who are experiencing some form of intimate partner abuse. Throughout our organization we interact with tens of thousands of young people citywide each year.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WARRI, Nigeria — More than 50 people were missing after a leaking oil pipeline exploded and caused a stampede in southern Nigeria, a local official said on Saturday.

Nengi James-Eriworio, a spokesman for the Nembe Chiefs Council, told The Associated Press that the blast on Friday caused a massive oil spill in the Nembe Kingdom in Bayelsa State.

There was no immediate word on injuries or other casualties beyond those missing.

The Nembe trunk line is operated by the Port Harcourt-based Aiteo Group and carries crude to the Bonny export terminal. The pipeline is jointly owned by Agip, Oando and Shell Petroleum Development Company.

Aiteo has not yet commented on the explosion. It was not immediately clear whether the pipeline had been shut down.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, and its owners, the Sackler family, agreed to pay $270 million to avoid going to a state court trial over the company’s role in the opioid addiction epidemic that has killed more than 200,000 Americans over the past two decades.

The payment, negotiated to settle a case brought by the state of Oklahoma, was far larger than two previous settlements Purdue Pharma had reached with other states. It could jolt other settlement talks with the company, including those in a consolidated collection of 1600 cases overseen by a federal judge in Cleveland.

“Purdue appears to have concluded that it was less risky to settle the Oklahoma case than have the allegations publicly aired against it during a televised trial and face exposure to what could have been an astronomical jury verdict,” said Abbe R. Gluck, a professor at Yale Law School who directs the Solomon Center for Health Policy and Law.

“That said,” she continued, “the settlement does put a stake in the ground for the other cases. It telegraphs what these cases might be worth and makes the elephant in the room even larger — namely, do Purdue and the Sacklers have sufficient funds to give fair payouts in the 1600-plus cases that remain?”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>When Michael Cohen testified in Washington for seven hours on Wednesday, he accused President Trump of lying, cheating, stealing and racism.

But the hearing had another main character: New York, the city that gave rise to both Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen.

Here are the seven most New York moments from the hearing.

Mr. Cohen said Mr. Trump fudged finances: Mr. Cohen said Mr. Trump misrepresented the value of his properties. At times, he undervalued his assets in New York to avoid paying taxes, Mr. Cohen said. At other times, he inflated them — like when he claimed $4 billion in “brand value” — in hopes of securing a bank loan, Mr. Cohen added.

How Mr. Cohen learned so much about Mr. Trump: In 2006, residents in Mr. Trump’s condo near the United Nations threatened to remove the Trump name from the building. Mr. Cohen, a personal injury lawyer living there, squashed the rebellion. Mr. Trump later hired him.

Mr. Cohen’s voice: The Long Island-raised Mr. Cohen spoke in a drawl common to anyone who grew up, say, east of Bayside, Queens. It also was a source of pride, and anxiety, for many who watched.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>People in parts of Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi are now picking through the wreckage left behind by Cyclone Idai, a category four storm that brought weeks of rain, floods and high winds to a swath of southeastern Africa.

Mozambique was hit especially hard. About 450 people died in Mozambique, 260 in Zimbabwe and 55 in Malawi, according to preliminary estimates from officials. Rescue workers say that thousands more in coastal areas of Mozambique may have been swept out to sea as the floodwaters rose. Their bodies may never be found.

At least three million people were affected by the devastation, said Antonio Guterres, the Secretary General of the United Nations. He called it “one of the worst weather-related catastrophes in the history of Africa,” and urged the international community to send relief and funds quickly. He called Cyclone Idai an “uncommonly fierce and prolonged storm” that is “yet another alarm bell about the dangers of climate change, especially in vulnerable, at-risk countries.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>DUBLIN — The British cabinet minister for Northern Ireland apologized on Thursday after causing widespread anger by asserting in Parliament that killings by soldiers and the police during the decades-long conflict there “were not crimes.”

The remarks from the minister, Karen Bradley, made on Wednesday, were particularly inflammatory because they came a week before prosecutors in Northern Ireland were scheduled to decide whether to charge British former soldiers over their roles in one of the conflict’s deadliest days: Jan. 30, 1972, known as Bloody Sunday. On that day, members of the Parachute Regiment fatally shot 13 unarmed protesters and bystanders in Londonderry. A 14th died months later.

Within hours of making her comments, faced with widespread condemnation in Ireland and elsewhere, Ms. Bradley returned to Parliament and said that she wanted to “clarify,” adding that her earlier statement “was not referring to any specific cases but expressing a general view.”

On Thursday, she offered a further, written statement, declaring that she was “profoundly sorry” for “the offense and hurt” caused by her words.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court announced Monday that it would not hear a case about whether a New Jersey county could allow churches to participate in grant programs for historic preservation even though the State Constitution forbids using tax money “for building or repairing any church.”

From 2012 to 2015, Morris County, N.J., gave more than $4.6 million to 12 churches to fix facades, stained-glass windows and aging roofs under a historic preservation program limited to local government, charitable conservancies and religious institutions.

Last year, the New Jersey Supreme Court halted payments to the churches, saying the State Constitution specifically prohibits them. The court also ruled that the prohibition in the State Constitution did not run afoul of the federal Constitution’s guarantee of free exercise of religion.

As is the United States Supreme Court’s custom, its brief order gave no reasons for turning down appeals from a county board and a church. Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh filed an opinion agreeing with the court’s decision not to hear the case but noting his view that “the decision of the New Jersey Supreme Court is in serious tension with this court’s religious equality precedents.”</TEXT>

The Clash of the ‘Star Wars’ References

Senator Mike Lee of Utah on Wednesday gave a speech on the Senate floor that was sarcastic to the point of absurdity. In a sendup of the Green New Deal, a sweeping climate proposal put forward by left-wing Democrats, Lee used an image of Luke Skywalker riding a Tauntaun in a “Star Wars” film, as well as a painting of President Ronald Reagan on a dinosaur.

Stephen Colbert mimicked his technique, breaking out an easel, pictures and his own “Star Wars” reference. “Senator Lee, you’re the most embarrassing part of a storied American institution. You, sir, are the Jar Jar Binks of the Senate,” he said, unveiling a picture of the reviled character.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>While other presidents and prime ministers have been close, the Trump-Netanyahu relationship has no precedent in their countries’ history, veteran diplomats say, encompassing deep parallels in their politics, similar struggles with scandals and outright copycatting in how they denigrate opponents. And the relationship has also benefited Mr. Trump, with Mr. Netanyahu’s policies alienating Jewish Democrats and helping Mr. Trump depict the Republicans as Israel’s only reliable source of unconditional American support.

But the prelude to the April 9 election in Israel could well be their last hurrah together.

Mr. Netanyahu’s defeat is now a serious possibility. His party is trailing that of a popular former army chief, Benny Gantz, in the polls. Even if Mr. Netanyahu wins, he may be unable to form a government because Mr. Gantz has vowed not to enter a coalition with him while he faces indictment. And if Mr. Netanyahu could forge a governing majority, it is likely to be so far right as to complicate or even derail the Trump administration’s long-awaited peace plan to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

In the United States, Mr. Netanyahu’s new alliance with a racist Israeli fringe party is already freeing Democrats to denounce him with fewer concerns about Republican blowback. And in a matter of months, the criminal case against Mr. Netanyahu could dislodge him from power once and for all.

For now, however, the administration’s favors keep on coming: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo just announced a stop in Israel on a Middle East swing beginning March 18. The political backup is almost certain to reach its peak a few days later, when Mr. Netanyahu is expected to get an Oval Office meeting, if not a formal White House dinner, during the yearly gathering of Aipac, the powerful pro-Israel lobby.

It’s gotten to the point that analysts tracking the American assistance to Mr. Netanyahu’s campaign have taken to guessing what Mr. Trump might toss his way next: merely more plaudits, or perhaps a meatier bone, like endorsing Republican-sponsored legislation to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WASHINGTON — Federal regulators moved on Wednesday to ease oversight of the country’s largest banks and other financial firms, continuing a push by the Trump administration to reverse rules that were put in place following the 2008 financial crisis.

The Federal Reserve said it would adjust the structure of its annual “stress tests,” which measure the ability of leading banks to withstand a potential economic or financial storm. The changes are likely to make it easier for banks to get regulatory approval to pay higher dividends or buy back their own shares.

Separately, a federal oversight panel announced that it planned to no longer designate big, non-bank financial institutions — insurers, asset managers and the like — as “systemically important.” The classification subjected such firms to more intrusive government regulation.

Taken together, the announcements on Wednesday represented a big win for the financial industry, which has been arguing since the Obama administration that a flurry of regulations imposed following the financial crisis were onerous and made it harder for banks to make loans and support economic growth. Bank executives also argue that because the industry is much financially stronger than it was a decade ago,many recent regulations are now unnecessary.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Since 1851, obituaries in The New York Times have been dominated by white men. With Overlooked, we’re adding the stories of remarkable people whose deaths went unreported in The Times.

Through fire and shock, the Great San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 destroyed more than 80 percent of the city’s buildings. The grand Fairmont Hotel, only days from opening, was gutted by flames, leaving only a shell.

The hotel’s owners, determined to rebuild, turned to a young architect, Julia Morgan. Only three years earlier she had built a bell tower on the campus of Mills College, and it had withstood the earthquake unscathed — proof that Morgan was as experienced in reinforced concrete as she was in European design.

But word that a woman had been hired to renovate the luxurious hotel was met with astonishment. Was the building really in the charge of a woman? Jane Armstrong, a reporter for The San Francisco Call, asked the project’s foreman in 1907 on a visit to the hotel’s ballroom after Morgan had restored it to its original splendor.

Yes, the foreman answered, it was in the charge of “a real architect, and her name happens to be Julia Morgan, but it might as well be John Morgan.’ ”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>One of YouTube’s biggest celebrities found himself entangled early Friday in news coverage of the mass shooting at two mosques in New Zealand.

A gunman who had broadcast part of the attack that left at least 49 people dead urged those watching to “subscribe to PewDiePie,” referring to the alias used by Felix Kjellberg, a Swede whose channel has long dominated YouTube and courted controversy along the way.

Mr. Kjellberg was quick to distance himself from the shooting.

“I feel absolutely sickened having my name uttered by this person,” he said on Twitter. “My heart and thoughts go out to the victims, families and everyone affected by this tragedy.”

Mr. Kjellberg is no stranger to controversy. In recent years, he has been embraced by some on the far right and faced criticism for his use of anti-Semitic imagery and racist and sexist language. Here is a closer look at PewDiePie and the New Zealand gunman’s words.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“Please join me in taking a collective breath to acknowledge that we’re all in this together.”

That solicitous invitation, issued by a cast member from the stage, is part of the preperformance ritual at “Good Friday,” a drama about rape culture and gun violence, at the Flea Theater. Warned that the play evokes strong reactions, spectators are assured that it’s O.K. to leave mid-show if they have to.

It’s all very supportive, in keeping with requirements that the playwright, Kristiana Rae Colón, outlines in a note in her script. Set in a college classroom during a campus shooting, “Good Friday” is activist theater, and it’s meant to unsettle and provoke. Ms. Colón just wants to do that responsibly.

But if a drama is really going to get under your skin, it needs to pulse with life. Sherri Eden Barber’s production — starring the Bats, the Flea’s resident company of young actors — does that only fitfully.

The show begins promisingly enough, with a video montage of young women getting ready for the day. The music is upbeat, the images animated yet ordinary. Then comes a tight shot of a torso, purpled with bruises. Some serious trauma has happened here.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WELLINGTON, New Zealand — As the release of a new documentary detailing abuse accusations against the singer Michael Jackson has prompted debate about his legacy, the public response to its contents is also leading radio stations across the globe to stop playing his music.

A radio network in Quebec pulled Jackson’s music from its nearly two dozen stations, according to The Canadian Press. In Britain, Variety reported that the BBC was forced to deny imposing such a ban after it was reported that the singer’s music had been “quietly dropped” from one of its stations.

And the backlash has led to an almost complete removal of the singer’s music from the airwaves in New Zealand, after the two largest radio networks — which own most of the country’s commercial stations — said Wednesday that they would no longer play Jackson’s songs.

In the New Zealand and Canadian cases, radio networks cited a change in public opinion about Jackson that was tied to the documentary “Leaving Neverland,” a two-part mini-series focusing on the accusations of two men who say Jackson abused them as children, as the reason for the ban. The program is scheduled for broadcast in New Zealand on Sunday and Monday.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>A yearlong investigation has found allegations of sexual misconduct, including male teachers having sex with students, at Saint Ann’s School, a Brooklyn private school known for its experimental educational approach and artistic culture.

In a letter sent Monday to parents, employees and alumni, school leaders said witnesses in interviews identified 19 former Saint Ann’s faculty and staff members who had potentially engaged in sexual misconduct or inappropriate behavior with students over the span of three decades.

Some of those cases were known to Stanley Bosworth, the eccentric headmaster and iconic figure who guided the school and was both beloved and controversial.

In one instance, the letter said, Mr. Bosworth himself was alleged to have “rubbed the leg of a female high school student during a one-on-one meeting in his office.”</TEXT>

Scouts BSA Troop 222 gathered last month at the Aspen Knolls Estate clubhouse on Staten Island for its annual induction ceremony. One 13-year-old recruit stepped across the ceremonial bridge, recited the Scout Law and swore the Boy Scouts of America oath, right hand lifted into the three-fingered salute .

Lora Panepinto, an eighth grader, is one of the first girls in New York City to be officially welcomed into the club that for more than a century had been called the Boy Scouts.

“I didn’t necessarily think about it as creating history — because it’s not always about being first,” Lora said. “It’s about being involved.”

As of Feb. 1, the Boy Scouts of America began accepting girls into all its ranks, including Boy Scouts, the 11- to 17-year-old age group that’s been rebranded as Scouts BSA. In New York City, at least 77 girls have registered so far. Eight all-girl troops have been fully formed in Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island and Westchester County, according to Boy Scout officials, and 20 other troops are in various stages of formation.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Nicole Marie Rivera and Sumit Khatod were married March 23 at Vizcaya Museum and Gardens in Miami. Naoko Miyamoto, a friend of the couple who became a Universal Life minister for the occasion, officiated. On March 22, the couple took part in a traditional Hindu ceremony led by Pandit Vinod R. Mehta at Maps Backlot Wynwood, an events space, also in Miami.

The bride and groom, both 32, met at the University of Pennsylvania, from which each received an M.B.A.

The bride is a director of global marketing at Clinique in New York. She graduated cum laude from Harvard.

She is the daughter of Terri L. Grosselin and Carlos E. Rivera of Miami. The bride’s father, who is retired, was a director of Latin America Tax and Finance at Procter &amp; Gamble in Panama. Her mother is an executive director of Ernst &amp; Young, the accounting firm, specializing in Mexican and Latin American tax advisory.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>It’s not just the historic setting (the building dates to 1927), the walls of reading material or the sun-drenched courtyard and cafe. There’s also a warmth and satisfaction in all that it represents. That’s the vision Mitchell Kaplan had in 1982 when he first opened the doors to what was a much smaller operation back then.

Thirty-seven years, an international book fair and eight additional locations later, Kaplan is celebrated as the man who turned Miami into a book town, and one of the foremost literary centers in the world, starting at a time when nobody took it seriously.

“I came of age on South Beach in the late ’60s, when Miami was seen as a fairly irrelevant place,” Kaplan said. Authors were his heroes: “To me, being a writer was always the highest calling one could have.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>LONDON — “I like it very much,” Verdi wrote of “La Forza del Destino” a few months before his opera was to open. “I don’t know if the public will feel the same, but it is certainly something quite out of the ordinary.”

The public, it turns out, often hasn’t felt the same. Even today, “Forza” struggles for affection more than practically any of Verdi’s mature works. It’s unwieldy and weird, with creaky plot twists and jarring shifts of mood.

Yet when it is taken seriously, staged intelligently, cast carefully, and conducted with energy and polish, it can indeed be something quite out of the ordinary. And at the Royal Opera here, in a production that opened on Thursday, it is fully extraordinary.

The central draw is the starry, comet-rare pairing of the soprano Anna Netrebko, 47, and the tenor Jonas Kaufmann, 49, the major singers of their generation. They have come together in a staged opera only once before: “La Traviata” here in London, 11 years ago.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“They’re taking all these susceptible kids and taking them out of circulation, in effect,” he said.

Officials are particularly worried because measles is among the most contagious of the infectious diseases. The virus can live for up to two hours in the airspace where an infected person has breathed, coughed or sneezed, and up to 90 percent of nonimmunized people who are exposed to the virus will also become infected, according to the C.D.C.

The M.M.R. vaccine, when given in two doses, is about 97 percent effective against measles.

Daniel Salmon, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said the risk that the unvaccinated children would spread the disease to people who could not, for medical reasons or age, be vaccinated made Rockland County’s order reasonable.

“One could even argue they’re compelled to take action because they’re responsible for protecting the public,” he said.

Rockland County officials, Mr. Day said, do not plan on “chasing people down” and asking for proof that they are vaccinated. The prohibition will be enforced retroactively, with parents facing up to six months in jail or a fine of up to $500, or both, if they are found to have allowed unvaccinated children in public spaces.

Rabbi Yakov Horowitz, the founding dean of Yeshiva Darchei Noam in Monsey, N.Y., a community at the center of Rockland County’s measles outbreak, said he strongly supports vaccinations, but he is worried that the county’s declaration might lead to potential harassment, attacks and discrimination against ultra-Orthodox Jews.

Some public health law experts also expressed concern that the county’s order could infringe on civil liberties.

Lawrence O. Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University, said he found Rockland County’s emergency order deeply problematic.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The 192 member schools of the New York State Association of Independent Schools share your well-founded concerns regarding the health and educational welfare of students enrolled in a subset of chronically underperforming nonpublic schools who have now been endangered by a measles outbreak.

Existing education law gives the New York State Education Department the authority to intervene whenever a credible complaint is made about a school. We are fully in favor of such oversight and urge the department to make better and more proactive use of this authority rather than burdening the resources of hundreds of local public school districts as well as the nonpublic schools.

The proposed regulations requiring oversight by local school boards are unnecessary and have the real potential to adversely affect the educational programs and independence of all nonpublic schools throughout New York State.

For many decades, state law has required nonpublic schools to provide education substantially equivalent to public schools while allowing each school the flexibility to determine the type of program that best enables it to carry out its established mission statement.</TEXT>

WASHINGTON — The decision by New York State to ban single-use plastic bags from retail stores makes it a good time to revisit everyone’s favorite environmental quandary: paper or plastic?

Unfortunately, there’s not a simple answer on whether paper or plastic bags are better for the environment. They both have downsides, but there are a few broad lessons to keep in mind when you’re hitting the grocery store.

Plastic bags, which often take centuries to decompose, can create a dreadful waste problem even though they’re far from the largest source of plastic waste in America — about 12 percent of the total.

On the other hand, paper bags typically require more energy and greenhouse gas emissions to produce, which isn’t great from a global warming standpoint.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>AMSTERDAM — An art crimes investigator in the Netherlands said Tuesday that he had recovered Pablo Picasso’s 1938 painting “Portrait of Dora Maar,” which was stolen from the yacht of its Saudi Arabian owner in the south of France in 1999.

Arthur Brand, an independent art detective based in Amsterdam, handed the painting over to an insurance company two weeks ago, he said. Mr. Brand had been trying to track down the Picasso painting since 2015, but all of his leads went nowhere.

Earlier this month, he said, he was contacted by “two persons with good contacts in the underworld,” who said the painting was in the Netherlands.

“They told me, ‘It’s in the hands of a businessman who got it as payment, and he doesn’t know what to do with it,’” Mr. Brand said in an interview. “I talked to the two guys and we made a plan to get it out of his hands.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>When the choreographer Martha Graham added men to her company, it struck many as a contradiction in terms. Her all-female troupe, founded in 1926, had powerfully demonstrated women’s independence. The only men with whom Graham regularly collaborated were designers and composers: above all, the composer Louis Horst and the sculptor-designer Isamu Noguchi.

She introduced a male dancer, Erick Hawkins, to this troupe in 1937, causing dismay among several of her dancers, colleagues and devotees. But Graham was not to be stopped. Further complications soon arose: Hawkins, 15 years her junior, became her partner, her lover and, eventually, her husband. How is it for a woman with a younger man? What challenges are involved in marriage? How is it for an original female artist in a male-dominated society? These were now among her themes.

She added a second man to the company in 1939, Merce Cunningham. A series of her most remarkable works followed — notably “Deaths and Entrances” (1943), “Appalachian Spring” (1944) and “Cave of the Heart” (1946) — several with the Graham-Hawkins relationship at their center.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>I think they’ll be less interest from the public, because the public will say, O.K., we know there’s been this investigation for the past two years. We think it was done by this guy that everyone seems to trust. He found that the president didn’t break the law. So why are all these other investigations going on? You have to think of it from the view of the person who hasn’t been following every whiff and blow of this. Well, what about the security clearance for Jared Kushner — and from the average perspective, they’ll say, look, all this stuff was looked at. It’s nothing here, so why am I still paying attention to this? [MUSIC]

Yeah. And they impeach him in the House, without the political backing of Mueller saying the president broke the law, and it goes to the Senate, and no Republicans come along. And it dies. And Donald Trump runs on, look at the witch hunt that impeached me in the House. And they couldn’t get it done in the Senate, and here I am running for re-election in 2020. They arm him with the ability to say, look at what they did to me. [MUSIC] And you have to remember that, of course, there’s stones out there that Mueller may not have looked under, but ultimately, Congress does not have the powers that Mueller had for his investigation. Mueller had a grand jury. He could use wiretaps. He could dip his hands into whatever the intelligence community had. Jerry Nadler, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and his investigators have a limited subpoena power, and they’re seen as political investigators. So it’s hard to think that if Mueller, in nearly two years of rummaging around Trump’s life, didn’t find it, that Nadler will.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The company’s chief executive, Peter Trepp, showed how stores could send automatic text messages to shoppers and receive their profiles to assist them better. He showed an example of a profile, which contained a shopper’s visit history, the minutes she spent in the store on her last trip, what she bought during that visit and the sum of her online purchases with the store’s chain.

In an email exchange after the conference, Mr. Trepp emphasized that the company was focused on the privacy and security of customer data. He said that “most of what we’ve sold in the past is related to loss prevention and mitigating organized retail crime,” meaning the technology has been used to identify shoplifters and known criminals.

“However,” Mr. Trepp said, “we see our business shifting toward providing solutions for improving the customer experience and believe that opt-in solutions like these will become the largest part of our business in the future. We are working with several large retailers on this today.”

The challenge of gathering more information from stores — which lack the reams of customer data collected by retailers online — was further highlighted in a presentation from Orbital Insight, a company that uses satellite imagery for a variety of analysis, including counting cars in parking lots to help gauge traffic to retail chains.

James Crawford, the company’s founder and chief executive, said that within the last year, the company had added geolocation data from cellphones to its offerings. While the data is anonymous, a unique number is associated with each phone so the company can study traffic patterns within malls or other “trade areas,” he said. Mr. Crawford said that while retailers knew the foot traffic in their own stores, they weren’t typically aware of what was happening in front of their stores or elsewhere in a mall or community.

Orbital Insight can gather geolocation data from 10 to 20 percent of phones in any mall, he said, with pings every 15 minutes on average. The company said in an email that it gathered information from vendors that draw data from “a combination of safety, social, family and weather apps,” and that it worked only with those that required consent for location services.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Republicans hate deficits. Or at least that’s what they claim.

Republicans in Congress spent the entire Obama administration inveighing against budget deficits, warning incessantly that we were going to have a Greek-style fiscal crisis any day now. Donald Trump, on the other hand, focused his ire mainly on trade deficits, insisting that “our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us.”

But over two years of unified G.O.P. control of government, a funny thing happened: Both deficits surged. The budget deficit has hit a level unprecedented except during wars and in the immediate aftermath of major economic crises; the trade deficit in goods has set a record.

What’s the significance of this tide of red ink?

Let’s be clear: Neither the budget deficit nor the trade deficit poses a clear and present danger to the U.S. economy. Advanced countries that borrow in their own currencies can and often do run up large debts without drastic consequences — which is why the debt panic of a few years ago was always nonsense.

Yet Trump’s twin deficits tell us a lot about both the tweeter in chief and his party — namely, that they’re both dishonest and ignorant.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Officials inside the Justice Department are preparing for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, to deliver his confidential report on the investigation’s findings to William P. Barr, the attorney general, according to multiple people inside the department who have been briefed on the planning. Mr. Barr will then summarize those findings and present them to Congress.

But the White House legal team and others have incorrectly predicted an imminent end to the investigation for more than a year. And Democratic lawmakers have vowed to obtain Mr. Mueller’s full report, no matter what Mr. Barr presents to them, guaranteeing that the submission of the report will not end debate over the Mueller inquiry and its findings. The House voted overwhelmingly on Thursday to pass a bipartisan resolution calling on Mr. Barr to release the full findings of the special counsel’s investigation to the public.

Mr. Weissmann, 60, has been considered a key player on Mr. Mueller’s team and one of its most aggressive prosecutors.

A graduate of Princeton University and Columbia Law School, Mr. Weissman previously worked as general counsel at the F.B.I. while Mr. Mueller was the director.

He gained a reputation as one of the most relentless prosecutors in the case against Enron, the energy company implicated in a widespread accounting fraud. Not only did he secure indictments of the company’s top officers, Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey Skilling, he also charged the wife of the company’s chief financial officer with tax fraud and won a case against Enron’s accounting firm, Arthur Anderson, which helped lead to the firm’s demise. The Supreme Court eventually overturned the decision in the Arthur Andersen case.

Within Mr. Mueller’s team, Mr. Weissmann maintained his own office, a sign of his seniority.

He helped construct the cases against Mr. Manafort, Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager, and Mr. Gates, who was Mr. Manafort’s business partner and later deputy on the Trump campaign.

Mr. Manafort was convicted on financial fraud charges stemming from his political consulting work in Ukraine and pleaded guilty to conspiracy and obstruction of justice in two separate court cases.

This Friday there will be a status hearing for Mr. Gates, whose sentencing has been delayed four times. He pleaded guilty to charges of financial fraud and lying to investigators and has been cooperating with the special counsel.</TEXT>

The caller said he saw two people pointing a gun at another person whose hands were duct taped near a black BMW sedan.</TEXT>

He will play a seven-night engagement at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater from May 2-11, becoming the latest high-profile musician to take the Broadway stage since Bruce Springsteen last year. According to a news release on Monday, the shows will serve as a career retrospective for Morrissey, and will come weeks before the release of a new record, “California Son,” an album of covers.

Broadway stages have become increasingly friendly to pop music, particularly jukebox musicals featuring songs with already built-in popularity. Cher, Donna Summer, the Go-Go’s and Jimmy Buffett are just some recent examples of artists whose music has been featured recently on Broadway. “Ain’t Too Proud: The Life and Times of the Temptations” will officially open later this month. “Springsteen on Broadway,” a show mixing songs and storytelling, earned an honorary Tony Award and was filmed for a Netflix special.

Tickets for the Morrissey shows will go on sale Friday, and many fans will have two hopes: that they will be able to get seats, and that the performances actually happen. The singer has had a penchant for canceling shows on short notice; in late 2017, the music site Consequence of Sound counted more than 120 that he had scrapped or postponed since 2012. (In one particularly infamous example, Morrissey canceled a 2017 performance in Paso Robles, Calif., because it was too cold.)

Last year, Morrissey, 59 — whose real name is Steven Patrick Morrissey — postponed European tour dates following inflammatory comments he made in an interview posted on his own website. Multiple quotes from the interview were thought too Islamophobic, including: “Halal slaughter requires certification that can only be given by supporters of ISIS,” and “This is the Mayor of London! And he cannot talk properly!” referring to Sadiq Khan, the city’s first Muslim mayor.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Bob Schildgen, who writes the Mr. Green column for the Sierra Club, said the main labels he trusts for coffee are the United States Department of Agriculture organic certification and the Fairttrade seal. He said Smithsonian Bird Friendly and Rainforest Alliance Certified also offer at least some assurances that the beans are produced with care.

Once you’ve found beans with a lower environmental impact, what else can you do?

Ditching single-serving pods is one step. Not only do they require more packaging, but single servings also take significantly more energy to brew than traditional drip methods.

Even John Sylvan, one of the founders of Keurig, says he wishes he he’d never introduced coffee pods to the world. “I feel bad sometimes that I ever did it,” he told The Atlantic, in 2015. “No matter what they say about recycling, those things will never be recyclable.” (A Kuerig representative disputed that, saying many of the company’s pods were already recyclable and that it aimed to make all of them recyclable by 2020).

You can skip the pods, and the electric coffee machine, by opting for pour-over preparations. You might also consider a metal or cloth filter instead of paper (though the metal allows more acid to pass through). Or, eliminate the filter altogether by pressing your coffee. Best yet, try cold brew. No boiling water, and thus no electricity, needed. And some aficionados say it delivers better flavor with less acidity.

Once you’ve made your coffee, some of the things that go with it can be just as important as the brew itself. Milk, for instance, accounts for more than half the emissions footprint of the average coffee (and that percentage is drastically higher for dairy-heavy orders like lattes).</TEXT>

ALBANY — The speed cameras that were installed around many New York City public schools several years ago seemed like an unqualified success: Traffic deaths near the cameras fell by more than half, and speeding was reduced by more than 60 percent.

And yet, last summer, the cameras went dark, a casualty of partisan politicking in Albany and a potent reminder of the capital’s reputation for dysfunction.

Now they are being revived, and then some: The newly Democratic-led State Legislature on Tuesday voted to renew and vastly expand the speed camera program, in a nearly fivefold increase that city officials say will cover every elementary, middle and high school in the city.

City officials said the authorization to place cameras in 750 school zones would make New York’s school speed camera program the most robust in the nation.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>BANGKOK — A Thai political party that nominated the sister of Thailand’s king as its candidate for prime minister was dissolved on Thursday by the constitutional court for “hostile action” against the nation’s political system and constitutional monarchy.

Under Thai law, members of the royal family are considered above politics. Ubolratana Rajakanya Sirivadhana Varnavadi, 67, the elder sister of King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun, was born a princess but gave up her royal titles when she married an American in 1972.

Nevertheless, within hours of Ms. Ubolratana’s nomination by the Thai Raksa Chart Party last month, King Vajiralongkorn, 66, deemed her candidacy “inappropriate,” effectively ending her brief political career.

“Involvement of a high-ranking member of the royal family in politics, in any way, is against the nation’s traditions, customs and culture and is therefore considered improper and highly inappropriate,” the king said in a royal communiqué on Feb. 8.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand — Hoping to limit the spread of hateful ideas attributed to the suspect accused of the Christchurch killings, New Zealand classified his so-called manifesto as “objectionable” on Saturday, making it a crime to possess or distribute it anywhere in the country.

“People who have downloaded this document, or printed it, should destroy any copies,” said David Shanks, the chief censor in New Zealand’s Department of Internal Affairs.

“There is an important distinction to be made between ‘hate speech,’ which may be rejected by many right-thinking people but which is legal to express, and this type of publication, which is deliberately constructed to inspire further murder and terrorism,” Mr. Shanks said. “It crosses the line.”

The ruling is part of a wider strategy by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to undermine the attempts by the suspect, Brenton Harrison Tarrant, to gain global notoriety. She has pledged never to utter his name publicly, and to press platforms like Facebook to deny access worldwide to the manifesto, which was published just before the slaughter of 50 people in two mosques, as well as the video the gunman apparently livestreamed of part of the attacks.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“Braving Heat and Coyotes to Be Raped at the Border” (front page, March 4) rightly shines a spotlight on this underrecognized issue.

As the article details, some sexual violence at the border is committed by private actors, like smugglers, but some is committed by federal actors, li ke Border Patrol agents . One of the lessons from the #MeToo movement is that accountability starts at the top, and that top management should make clear that sexual violence, harassment and other forms of discrimination will not be tolerated.

Yet under current law, th e United States government bears no direct civil rights accountability for sexual violence committed by its agents, and the Supreme Court in recent years has narrowed the circumstances in which federal agents themselves may be liable.

Both the government and individual agents should be held to account to recognize the ways that sexual violence violates civil rights, both at and away from the border.</TEXT>

The surge in Central Americans seeking asylum in the United States is straining facilities across the Southwest border, with Border Patrol processing facilities this week handling thousands of people in excess of the system’s capacity. President Trump threatened to close the border next week if Mexico did not halt “all illegal immigration” into the United States.

El Paso, the Texas border city where the president held a rally in February calling for his wall with Mexico, is emerging as a flash point. Border Patrol agents in the city have begun holding migrant families in an area under a bridge, surrounded by fencing and razor wire.

Photos of the conditions drew attention this week on social media and in news reports. Here’s a look at where the migrants came from, and how they came to be detained under the bridge.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>SEATTLE — Microsoft took control of 99 websites that it said Iranian hackers had used to try to steal sensitive information from targets in the United States, according to court documents unsealed Wednesday.

By taking over the sites, Microsoft can stop future cyberattacks and monitor how previously infected computers were compromised, the company said.

The hackers “specifically directed” their attacks on people in Washington, Microsoft said in the filing. The hacking group typically has targeted the personal email accounts of people working in both the public and private sectors, including dissidents and workers in government agencies, Microsoft said in court documents.

People working in the Treasury Department and similar agencies in other Western governments were among those targeted, according to a person with knowledge of the attacks who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Nearly two weeks after basketball players at the University of Mississippi knelt during the national anthem in protest of a pro-Confederate rally that ended on campus, the student government voted unanimously to move a prominent statue of a Confederate soldier.

The resolution passed, 47-0, to thunderous applause in the Associated Student Body senate on Tuesday night. The faculty senate unanimously passed a similar measure on Thursday evening.

The student resolution “allows us to remember history, and remember the role the university played during the Civil War, without giving the statue the same power,” said John Chappell, the president of the university’s College Democrats.

Mr. Chappell was one of six students who spent months researching legal opinions involving the movement of Confederate monuments and consulting with legal and academic experts to write the resolution, which received bipartisan support.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>But because of a real estate blunder involving a storage facility and crippling rent, those stores went out of business.

“I had chosen the locations for my stores and had negotiated all my leases,” said Ms. Podell, who is now in her 70s. “And a friend and mentor who worked in the furniture business told me, ‘If you can do it for yourself, you can do it for others.’”

Well, sure she could, but first someone had to give her the chance. “Coming up was harder than it needed to be,” said Ms. Podell, who has been in the business for more than 25 years. “The problem was that everyone teamed up. It was a boys’ club, and it’s not that different today. I had no one to talk to and no one to mentor me. I had to learn on my own.”

In particular, she remembers looking at a building with a school on the ground floor. “I thought, ‘Wow, that’s prime real estate. Maybe we can ask the school if it wants to move.’ How naïve to get involved with the Department of Education.”

Because Ms. Podell failed to appreciate the complexity — and futility — of such an undertaking, she spent days and weeks calling people. “I wasted all that time on something I couldn’t realistically realize,” she said. “And for a broker, all you have is time.”

Back then, the only real advantage to being a woman in the business was that there were very few women brokers, “and landlords would remember me,” she said. “The retailers had no problem with my being a woman. I had been a retailer; I understood the great risk they were taking, and they knew I was interested in doing the right thing for them.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>During the Obama administration, he warned that the Fed was sowing the seeds of hyperinflation. “Zero interest rates haven’t helped the economy,” Mr. Moore told The Washington Post in 2015. Following Mr. Trump’s election, Mr. Moore executed a quick U-turn. He began to insist that lower interest rates were just what the economy needed. Mr. Trump reportedly settled on Mr. Moore after he was shown an article Mr. Moore co-wrote earlier this month making that case.

Mr. Moore has not argued that he changed his mind because he realized he was wrong, or because the facts changed. Indeed, on another question of public policy, he has maintained a politically convenient position despite the accumulation of facts to the contrary. He is a stalwart evangelist for the unsupported belief that tax cuts cure slow growth.

The state of Kansas took Mr. Moore’s advice on fiscal policy in 2013, adopting a set of tax cuts recommended by Mr. Moore and his longtime collaborator Arthur Laffer. The two men promised a “near immediate” increase in economic growth. Instead, the state’s economy languished and the state government fell into a funding crisis. In the course of the subsequent debate, the editorial page editor of The Kansas City Star announced that Mr. Moore had misstated so many facts that she would no longer publish his contributions in the paper.

There is a legitimate debate to be had about the level of interest rates. Many economists, both liberals and conservatives, shared Mr. Trump’s concerns about the Fed’s move toward higher rates last year. The Fed itself has decided to suspend further rate increases.

But that is no reason to let Mr. Trump install a loyalist at the Fed. The public interest is best served by appointing thoughtful and experienced policymakers to the Fed’s board, and then standing back and letting them do their best. Politicians, always looking to the next election, tend to want faster economic growth in the near term without particular regard for the long-term consequences. Mr. Trump reportedly has dismissed concerns about the rise of the federal debt, for example, by telling advisers, “Yeah, but I won’t be here.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>But that’s not the only meaningful result. If a state civil investigation turned up more evidence of criminal fraud, state and federal prosecutors could use these findings to indict the Trump Organization and its officials, including Mr. Weisselberg.

In addition to allegations of campaign finance felonies, Mr. Cohen also alleged that Mr. Weisselberg, along with the Trump Organization officials Mr. Lieberman and Mr. Calamari, engaged in insurance fraud, bank fraud and tax fraud by dishonestly inflating and then deflating the valuation of Trump assets for insurance, banking and tax advantages. Keep in mind that the Southern District of New York, when it was headed by Rudolph Giuliani in 1988, indicted a state legislator for overvaluing property and submitting false financial statements.

In the current situation, the proceeding would start with a civil investigation of fraud, not a criminal investigation. In such a civil investigation, many Trump family members and Organization officials would probably invoke the Fifth Amendment’s privilege against self-incrimination, because testimony in a civil deposition could lead to criminal implications. But the investigation could turn up clear evidence of crimes, leading some of these officials to make cooperation deals with state prosecutors and perhaps waive their Fifth Amendment claims. That would allow them to admit their crimes and testify against higher officials.

Mr. Weisselberg is more likely to cooperate if the New York attorney general and state prosecutors have already begun to investigate his conduct. President Trump cannot use a pardon to rescue Mr. Weisselberg from state prosecution; presidential pardons do not affect state criminal liability. Moreover, unlike federal prosecutors at the Southern District of New York or in Robert Mueller’s office, Mr. Trump cannot fire or interfere with them.

The window for these prosecutions to move forward is closing. The states are a complementary law enforcement system, and they can do what Mr. Mueller might not be able to do: Send a message that the president is not above the rule of law.

This state investigation might turn up evidence that President Trump committed crimes himself. If the Justice Department will not indict a sitting president, we must ask what is worse: the potential distraction of states indicting presidents, or the crisis for the rule of law of presidential immunity, especially during a re-election when those crimes may recur with the goal of four more years of impunity. If the specter of state indictments is unsettling, that is a reason to allow federal prosecutors to bring indictments instead, perhaps building on state officials’ findings.

Indictments, even if trials are long delayed, at least serve an important message from law enforcement to society about legal norms. Even if justice is delayed, no one will be above the law.</TEXT>

Earlier on Sunday Taiwan scrambled aircraft to drive away the two Chinese planes, the self-ruled island’s defense ministry said.

China’s move “seriously impacted regional safety and stability,” the ministry said in a statement.

There was no immediate reaction from Beijing, which views Taiwan as part of its territory.

Huang Chung-yen, a spokesman for Taiwan’s Presidential Office, said China “should stop behavior of this sort, which endangers regional peace, and not be an international troublemaker.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>North Korea expects the Spanish authorities to “bring the terrorists and their wire pullers to justice in conformity with the relevant international law,” he said.

The raid at the North Korean Embassy took place five days before the start of President Trump’s summit meeting in Vietnam with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un.

Ten suspects attacked embassy employees with knives, machetes, metal bars and fake pellet guns, a Spanish judge investigating the case said last week. After holding the employees hostage for several hours, the assailants fled with a cellphone, two pen drives, and two computers and two hard drives that probably contained security footage, the judge reported.

The judge identified the leader of the gang as Adrian Hong Chang, who he said was a Mexican man who lives in the United States. Mr. Hong Chang escaped to the United States and got in touch with the F.B.I., offering to share “audiovisual material” obtained during the embassy attack, the judge said.

An international arrest warrant has also been issued for an American identified as Sam Ruy.

A mysterious organization that describes itself as a dissident group dedicated to toppling Mr. Kim’s regime in Pyongyang has since claimed responsibility. The group, known as Cheollima Civil Defense, or Free Joseon, said on its website that its action at the embassy had not been “an attack,” that no one had been beaten and that no weapons had been used.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>A federal judge on Thursday dismissed a lawsuit brought against President Trump and his former lawyer by Stormy Daniels, a pornographic film actress who was paid to keep quiet about an alleged affair with Mr. Trump before the 2016 election.

The suit, brought a year ago in California, had sought to release Ms. Daniels from the nondisclosure agreement she had signed. As part of her arrangement, she received $130,000 in hush money through the president’s personal lawyer at the time, Michael D. Cohen.

As he tossed out the case this week, Judge S. James Otero, of United States District Court in Los Angeles, called the legal argument moot, given that Ms. Daniels had not been held to the terms of the agreement.

Indeed, Ms. Daniels and her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, have spoken freely about the arrangement since the filing last March. The lawsuit led to escalating national attention that culminated in Mr. Cohen’s pleading guilty to related campaign-finance crimes last summer.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>President Trump’s former lawyer and personal fixer, above, painted a damning picture of life inside the president’s inner circle.

While Democrats are not likely to immediately pursue impeachment, Michael Cohen’s statements may open a new phase of political turbulence for Mr. Trump heading into the 2020 election.

Here are five takeaways from Mr. Cohen’s testimony.

We also reported that Mr. Trump ordered in May that Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser, be given a top-secret security clearance, overruling officials’ concerns. House Democrats are demanding more information about the matter.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>A little more than a week after prosecutors in Florida charged Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, with soliciting prostitution, what ordinarily would be a minor case has become a legal battle involving some of the most expensive and sought-after lawyers in the country.

To lead his defense, Mr. Kraft, a billionaire friend of President Trump and one of the most powerful owners in the N.F.L., has retained William A. Burck, who was a lawyer in the George W. Bush White House and had a role in the screening of documents related to Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh’s recent Supreme Court nomination. Mr. Kraft has also hired Jack Goldberger, the Florida lawyer who defended Jeffrey E. Epstein, a wealthy New York financier accused of trafficking underage girls for sex.

Mr. Goldberger and Mr. Burck did not return calls for comment, but they could mount an aggressive defense by poking holes in video evidence that may prove that Mr. Kraft did not ask anyone for sex and by arguing that the police violated Mr. Kraft’s Fourth Amendment rights during an improper traffic stop, among other arguments.

Prosecutors in Palm Beach County, Fla., so far have taken a hard line on Mr. Kraft and the two dozen other individuals who have been accused of soliciting prostitution at the Orchids of Asia Day Spa, a massage parlor and salon in a Jupiter, Fla., strip mall about a 30-minute drive from Mr. Kraft’s home in Palm Beach. Last week, they increased the severity of the charges, from second-degree to first-degree misdemeanors.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>What seemed like a relatively slow news days decelerated further when Fox News took a moment to declare that the 94-year-old Jimmy Carter had become the oldest former living United States president in history, surpassing the first President George Bush.

Then, at last, came the news that the special counsel’s work was done.

After all the buildup, the anchors had one new development to gnaw on: the fact that, according to a Justice Department official, the Mueller report recommended no new charges. (Before the report was submitted, the special counsel had filed 199 charges against 34 people and three companies.)

On NBC, after the main news had hit, the veteran Justice Department reporter Pete Williams reported that “there will be no more indictments from the special counsel.” Others seemed reluctant to go there, at least at first. “Nobody knows anything,” MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough cautioned on Twitter. And the Fox News anchor Bret Baier said, “We don’t have the meat of what’s in this report at this hour.”

Appearing as a guest on Mr. Baier’s show, the Fox News host Chris Wallace said: “The fact that that investigation is over is a big milestone, even if we don’t know what the final conclusion of the special counsel was. We will have to wait and see.”

He continued: “And I do think that if — and I repeat if — it should be the president is cleared of the basic fundamental charges of the special counsel, whether it was, one, collusion or, two, obstruction of justice, that is a major victory for the president.”

And before you knew it, television was populated, as it had been earlier in the day, with talking heads spinning out various possibilities that could fill the news maw in the days to come.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>He talked about how he arranged for students to take their SAT or ACT exams at special sites where he had bribed the proctors on those tests to basically correct the student’s answers. He talked about how he encouraged the parents to get their children tested for disabilities so that they could have more time to complete the exam. He talked about how he would sometimes even have a man — an adult — pose as the students at the test centers that he, quote, unquote, “controlled,” and that adult would take the test for the kids. And this guy was so good at it, he could basically get any score that they wanted.

Cutting out the middleman or cutting out the pretense of anything other than paying people off and bribery. And I think the reason why this case is so fascinating, and we’re sitting here talking about it and everybody is so interested in it, is the difference between these two doors — the side door and the back door. Now, if you’re the F.B.I., that line is very clear. It’s clear that it is completely illegal to simply bribe somebody to get your kid into the college of your choice. But if you’re one of these parents, where you’re operating in a world where you know many people are paying tens of thousands of dollars or hundreds of thousands of dollars to universities in an often successful attempt to get your kid into the college, then maybe this doesn’t seem so strange.

They’re already wealthy, and studies have shown that people who go to colleges and are already coming in with wealth do not necessarily see a huge jump in their income over a lifetime. On the other hand, that’s not true for kids who come from poorer families. There is a lot that shows — especially if you go to a highly selective college and if you’re successful, there’s lots of things that show your income potential goes way up. It is a path to the middle class. That’s what we’ve always thought of college as being — a path to the middle class. But it’s not clear that if you’re already part of the most-upper class, that you need to go to some specific college to stay in that upper class.

I don’t think it’s about economics. That might be part of it, or they might tell themselves that it’s part of it. But it is obviously at least somewhat about status, about maybe being able to put that sticker on the back of your car that says, my student goes to Yale University. Maybe it’s that you want to give your kid some perfect social experience that you think they’re going to have at this right school. Or maybe you just want to save your kid embarrassment. Clearly these parents didn’t have a lot of faith in their kids. And what’s also really fascinating here is that it’s not just Ivy League schools. Yale is, of course, the one that is sort of eye-popping. And there’s Stanford, and there’s all sorts of elite schools. There’s also U.C.L.A. But there’s also schools like Wake Forest University and University of Texas at Austin — all schools that they might have been just fine getting into on their own, and are not schools that we think of as holding a lot of cachet in these elite circles. So what was that about? Why were they so willing to spend so much money and so much effort and break the law to get into schools? We really don’t know the answer to that yet.

Another way to look at it from the point of view of the parents is that no matter what their motivations are, whether they be social or whether they want an education for their children that they believe is the best education that money can buy, they have this feeling that the kids face really long odds. College has never been more competitive. I think that Harvard accepted about 5 percent of all of the students who applied last year. And they understand that colleges are also looking for a wide array of students as well. They don’t want a class just packed with all of the people who can pay full tuition, donate a million dollars to a development fund and continue to give for the rest of their lives because they’re extremely well-heeled. They’re looking for something more. And they might worry that their students are not extraordinary enough to get in. And so they’re going to use the money that they have to try to offset not a systemic inequity, like socioeconomic inequities or racial inequities, but to offset their children’s own inability to get in.

A lot of it seems to be about the certainty of it, about the security. It’s not a question of maybe you will or won’t get into this school. It’s, I’m going to make sure that you have a spot at this specific school that you want to be at, that I know I can get you into. And I am going to be able to breathe a sigh of relief or celebrate or congratulate you much earlier, with much more confidence, than I would if I had gone through the front door, or even if I had gone through the back door.

They’ve been operating under the assumption that they earned their spot. They deserve it. And I think this is forcing us to have a conversation, to think about, what does deserving it really mean? What this has done is really laid bare, for all of us to see in plain view, how unequal the system truly is — that if you have enough money, you can buy your way in. But at the same time, there are thousands of students who are taking out massive loans to come in and are desperate to get into higher education, which our country has long believed is the way to get into the middle and upper class. It’s supposed to be this system based on your academic merit that’s going to give you a path to get from wherever you started from to where you want to be. But what we’ve seen is that’s not true. If you believe that education, and that a college education specifically, is the great equalizer or can be the great equalizer of our country, what this shows you is that that system is completely broken.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>It’s generally not a good sign for an actor when the first night of performance is also the last.

But that’s the conceit behind “Nassim,” a charming play running Off Broadway, in which a different actor each night performs, without rehearsal, a script written by Nassim Soleimanpour, an Iranian playwright living in Germany. At each show the game performer and the droll playwright forge a relationship of sorts, navigating barriers of language and life experience before a live audience.

The conceit behind these New York Times “exit interviews” is that artists can talk about what they experienced, and what they learned, as a run comes to a close. But we decided in this case to bend the structure, just as the play does, to reflect the experience of an actor who exits a play after just 75 minutes.

Tracy Letts is an enormously accomplished performer and writer — a longtime member of the Steppenwolf Theater Company ensemble in Chicago, in 2008 he won a Pulitzer Prize and a Tony Award as the author of “August: Osage County,” and in 2013 he won a Tony Award as an actor in a revival of “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” He has also written for, and performed on, television (“Homeland,” “Divorce”) and film (“Lady Bird”).

Mr. Letts lives in Chicago but is in New York for a Broadway revival of “All My Sons,” in which he’ll star opposite Annette Bening. He performed in “Nassim” at the request of one of its producers, Scott Morfee, who has also presented plays which Mr. Letts has written (“Bug”) and acted in (“Orson’s Shadow”).</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Much of this success results from policies that would most likely be in jeopardy should the Rifle and Pistol Association case go against New York — for instance, restrictions on where people can carry guns and prohibitions on tourists’ bringing weapons into the city. Perhaps most important, regulations governing how people carry guns in New York City differ from those applied in parts of the state that have long and respected traditions of firearm ownership, such as in upstate New York.

At stake in cases like Rifle and Pistol is the possible nationalization of disastrous policies from pro-gun states — not just loosened gun laws but also pre-emptions of how state or local governments can decide what works best. If the Supreme Court rules in favor of the plaintiffs in any one of these types of cases, the decision could signal that more significant gun control laws might not withstand legal challenges. Additionally, the justices could expand Second Amendment protections beyond the home, an issue left open in previous Supreme Court decisions, and could open the door to overturning longstanding laws governing concealed-carry, gun permitting and other restrictions enacted at the local and state levels.

The current composition of the court suggests we should brace for decisions that upend local and state regulations in favor of nationally mandated policies that make it ever easier for people to purchase and carry guns. The nomination of President Trump’s first court appointee, Neil Gorsuch, was buoyed by a $1 million ad campaign by the National Rifle Association. And his second appointee, Brett Kavanaugh, wrote a 2011 circuit court dissent in which he argued that Washington, D.C., could not ban semiautomatic rifles on its streets because the right to bear arms superseded its interest in public safety.

Missouri, Tennessee and Washington are not New York City. People are generally not allowed to carry guns around New York City, to safeguard the delicate and at times tense choreography that gives the city its charm. New Yorkers cram into crowded subway cars, brush by one another on busy sidewalks and drive haltingly through traffic-filled streets. This bustle of the everyday builds on often unspoken communal understandings of neighborliness and trust.

But imagine a New York where more and more of your neighbors carry guns. If the Supreme Court sides with the complainants in Rifle and Pistol, you won’t need to imagine.

      <TEXT>Six new paperbacks to check out this week.

GOD SAVE TEXAS: A Journey Into the Soul of the Lone Star State, by Lawrence Wright. (Vintage, $16.95.) Wright, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and longtime resident of the state, explores Texas’ foibles, ironies and contradictions with affection. Given the state’s booming population and economic growth, Wright’s book seems to say, America’s future runs through Texas — whether the rest of the country likes it or not.

HOW IT HAPPENED, by Michael Koryta. (Back Bay/Little, Brown, $16.99.) In this murder mystery, Rob Barrett, an interrogation specialist with the F.B.I., is sent to investigate a double homicide that’s rattled the town of Port Hope, Me. He believes the confession by a young addict, who directs him to where she says the bodies can be found. But when the details don’t seem to pan out, he’s kicked off the case.

UNEASY PEACE: The Great Crime Decline, the Renewal of City Life, and the Next War on Violence, by Patrick Sharkey. (Norton, $16.95.) What’s the downside to falling crime rates nationwide? In Sharkey’s analysis, what was done to make those rates plunge included increased incarceration rates and violent policing tactics. This book admirably connects the story of how the country became safer with why many communities are wary of the police.

A LONG WAY FROM HOME, by Peter Carey. (Vintage, $16.95.) A married couple and their bachelor neighbor set out on a 10,000-mile endurance contest around Australia in the hopes of eventually opening their own auto dealership. Our reviewer, Craig Taylor, praised this shape-shifting, propulsive novel, writing: “With all its inventive momentum, all its pleasurable beats, the fast pace of the race, the scenery unfurling, the novel ends up far from where it started, in a place of historical reckoning and colonial guilt.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Good Thursday morning. Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today.
• How did President Trump come to support a court-ordered demolition of the Affordable Care Act? It happened after a heated Oval Office meeting, in which Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff, prevailed over the vice president and the White House counsel. Many Republicans are worried that a health care fight could empower Democrats, like it did in the midterm elections.
• A decade ago, Senator Cory Booker was the rising-star mayor of Newark with a problem: crime. The way he handled it may offer insights into what kind of president he would be. Here’s a look at Newark’s police department under Mr. Booker.
• Days after Attorney General William P. Barr wrote his summary of the still-secret report by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, a pressing mystery remains: Why did Mr. Mueller take no position on whether the president obstructed justice?</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WASHINGTON — If Zack Wheeler, the Mets’ third starter, needed any reminder that his 10-1 record during the second half of last season meant nothing in the new campaign, the Nationals were happy to provide one on Sunday.

With the Mets on the verge of collecting a series sweep, Wheeler surrendered a single on his first pitch. By the bottom of the third inning, he gave up a three-run homer to Nationals shortstop Trea Turner. Wheeler, whose fastball topped out at 98 miles per hour, was removed from the game after the fifth, having given up four earned runs.

“I think I just got a little fastball-happy,” he said.

It was a mistake that Mets reliever Justin Wilson repeated in the ninth. While the Mets had rallied to tie the game at 5-5 in the eighth, it was another fastball, this time from Wilson in a full count, that Turner rerouted into the stands for a walk-off win, 6-5.

The Mets (2-1) lost the game but won the series. Manager Mickey Callaway maintained that his team’s late rally left the Nationals (1-2) a message.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>We also asked YouGov Blue to survey the Green New Deal. Our YouGov survey asked, “Would you support or oppose a Green New Deal to end fossil fuel use in the United States and have the government create clean energy jobs? The plan would be paid for by raising taxes, including a tax on carbon emissions.” With this framing, 43 percent of registered voters expressed support, with 38 percent opposed and the rest unsure.

Not all parts of the Green New Deal are popular. In our polling with Civis, a full shift to electric cars by 2030 and the phasing out of all power plants by 2035 were both underwater. And there is no doubt that some additional parts will lose support after facing a right-wing onslaught. On the other hand, policies like green jobs, drinking water infrastructure and reforestation were wildly popular. Clean water had net support in every state in the country, and reforestation is underwater in Wyoming only. In other words, there is no part in the country where at least some aspects of the Green New Deal will not be winning issues.

New polling from 350 Action and Data for Progress conducted by YouGov Blue shows that rejecting fossil fuel money is popular (49 percent support their representatives refusing campaign contributions from fossil fuel PACs, with 19 percent opposed and the rest unsure). A “keep it in the ground” approach to energy policy that would phase out fossil fuel infrastructure in favor of renewable alternatives garnered even more support (56 percent in support, 26 percent opposed). “Climate policy might befuddle Democratic leadership, but the grass roots knows what’s up,” Julian Brave Noisecat, a policy analyst for 350 Action, told me.

The core challenge the Green New Deal faces is not so much on the merits of the concept or even its political feasibility; it is that many of its Democratic supporters have met an aggressive and one-sided onslaught from the right with very little by way of response. According to data shared with The Times from Navigator, a progressive polling project, 37 percent of Republican viewers of Fox News had heard “a lot” about the Green New Deal, compared with 14 percent of all registered voters. Only 6 percent of non-Republican, non-Fox viewers had heard “a lot” about the Green New Deal, and 40 percent had heard nothing at all (compared with 14 percent of Republican viewers of Fox News).

Across all registered voters who had heard about the Green New Deal, 32 percent reported seeing mostly negative coverage, 12 percent mostly positive, 42 percent a mix and the rest couldn’t recall. (Among Fox-viewing Republicans, it’s 68 percent, 4 percent, 24 percent and 4 percent.)

We’re seeing in real time the impact of right-wing attacks. When asked simply, “Based on what you know, do you support or oppose the Green New Deal?,” 22 percent of respondents are in support, 29 percent are opposed and 49 percent are not sure. But 74 percent of Fox-viewing Republicans oppose the Green New Deal (65 percent strongly), and only 21 percent have not formed an opinion. Among people who are not Republicans and not Fox viewers, 32 percent support the Green New Deal, 8 percent oppose it and a whopping 61 percent have not formed an opinion. (Navigator polling shows that Fox News viewers are also far more likely to deny climate change.)

Though many components of the Green New Deal are popular, the Republican propaganda machine has already reshaped the narrative, and it has done so with virtually no coordinated pushback from progressives, or certainly nowhere near enough, a worrying pattern. Tuesday’s Senate vote, where Democrats were urged by their leaders to take no stance at all and vote present, however expedient, is indicative of the broader trend — a defensive crouch from Democrats in response to an onslaught from the right.

The Green New Deal is the future of the Democratic Party: Among likely Democratic primary voters in our Civis polling, 71 percent supported the Green New Deal and 14 percent opposed it. Democrats should not be afraid to embrace it, and Republicans who mess with it — despite the temporary success of their aggressive tactics — will do so at their own risk.

      <TEXT>PHILADELPHIA — Alexandar Georgiev made 29 saves, and Ryan Strome scored in a third straight game, leading the Rangers past the Philadelphia Flyers, 3-0, on Sunday.

Pavel Buchnevich and Brady Skjei also scored for the Rangers, who won consecutive games for the first time since mid-January, and Brett Howden had two assists.

Strome scored late in the first period, giving the Rangers a 2-0 lead when he went top shelf on Flyers goalie Carter Hart, who had only one defenseman helping him defend against an odd-man rush.

The goal was Strome’s 17th of the season for the Rangers and his 18th over all. He leads the N.H.L. in goals for his new team after being acquired from Edmonton in November.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WASHINGTON — The Senate will vote Wednesday on whether to cut off American military assistance for Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen, preparing again to rebuke President Trump for his continued defense of the kingdom after the killing of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

The Yemen vote sets up something of a one-two punch for senators hoping to defy the president. The second punch may land Thursday, when the Senate has the chance to give final passage to a resolution overturning the president’s declaration of a national emergency to secure funding for his border wall.

Passage of the measures would prompt the first vetoes of Mr. Trump’s presidency.

“The resolution we will vote on in the Senate tomorrow to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen is enormously important and historic,” Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, said Tuesday in a statement. “This war is both a humanitarian and a strategic disaster, and Congress has the opportunity to end it.”

Supporters of the Yemen resolution have faced a long and grueling road to get the legislation onto the president’s desk. The Senate — led by the resolution’s authors, Mr. Sanders, Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, and Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut — first passed the measure 56 to 41 in December, but Paul D. Ryan, the speaker at the time, refused to take up the resolution.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The plan was simple: Take the train to the ski slopes.

Why? Trains are romantic. Trains are relatively climate-friendly. And I had recently spent an hour and a half on a perfect powder day sitting in traffic, trying to drive up Little Cottonwood Canyon to Snowbird, near Salt Lake City.

So I decided to swear off car travel for a weekend of skiing and snowboarding via the rails.

Two developments in Denver made the scheme possible: In 2016 the city opened the A line train, which runs from Denver International Airport to Union Station, an exquisitely restored Beaux-Arts terminal and the city’s main transit hub, in 37 minutes.

The following year, Amtrak launched its service on the Winter Park Express, a snow-season train that leaves Union Station each weekend and delivers passengers to the base of the Winter Park Resort, a burly, 3,000-acre ski mountain about 70 miles outside Denver.

Getting to the mountain, and the other resorts west of Denver by car is increasingly an issue. On a snowy weekend, traffic on I-70, the main route to the mountains, can turn an hour-and-a-half drive to Winter Park into a four-hour ordeal. Perhaps not surprisingly, many of the Winter Park Express’s trips sell out, with 400 passengers choosing to ride the rails each trip.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WASHINGTON — A Republican senator’s revelation of her sexual assault while serving in the Air Force is likely to renew debate over how to best get justice for victims, an issue that seemed settled several years ago when Congress adjusted conduct codes that dictate military justice.

Long before the #MeToo movement brought sexual violence and harassment to the fore, women in the military and their advocates had highlighted such misconduct in the armed forces. In 2005, Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and at the time a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, questioned a top Army official about the issue, and he dismissed her with annoyance.

In the intervening years, Congress has sought to address the matter, which leaves a large number of veterans — women and men alike — in despair long afterward.

But it stopped short of a plan championed in 2013 by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, that would have taken sexual assault cases outside the military chain of command. Military prosecutors, rather than accusers’ commanders, would have the power to decide which cases to try.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“I have to use this umbrella to protect myself from the torrent of illegal leaks.” Roger Stone. He’s a Republican political consultant and a self-described — “Agent provocateur.” He was an adviser to longtime friend Donald Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign. “Trying to stop Trump is like stepping in front of a hurtling freight train.” Now, Stone is back in the spotlight. He’s been charged as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation over his communications with WikiLeaks, the organization that released Clinton campaign emails stolen by the Russian government to help Trump win. In 2016, Stone said he had an in with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. “I actually have communicated with Assange.” “We have a mutual acquaintance who is a fine gentleman.” But now, he says it was all part of his political game. “I set a Google News alert for ‘Julian Assange.’ I read every interview he gave. And I used that information to posture and to bluff and to punk the Democrats.” Stone has built a reputation on winning at all costs, even if it means bending the truth. “I assumed he was lying. It’s something Roger does.” “Posture and bluff. That’s politics.” Stone started his career as a political operative at a young age. At 19, he was an entry-level trickster for Nixon’s re-election campaign. His name later came up in the Watergate investigation. “I paid $100 to Mr. Roger Stone on one occasion to leave a leaflet, I believe, at Senator McGovern’s headquarters.” Stone and Trump have been friends and associates since the 1980s, when Stone was working as a political consultant with Paul Manafort. Yes, that Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign manager, who has since been convicted of financial fraud. Stone says he has been encouraging Donald Trump to run for president since 1988. “I would say that I would have a hell of a chance of winning.” “Between his outspokenness, his national name identification and his issue positions, he could be a formidable candidate.” “I guess we’re looking at it very seriously.” After he got into some trouble working for Bob Dole in 1996, he bounced back — but has largely worked outside of political campaigns. Stone has a unique personal brand: a mix of provocation, politics and fashion. He can often be found discussing some of his favorite topics: the Clintons, how L.B.J. was behind the assassination of J.F.K. and “fake news.” “Fake news.” Stone strongly denies any wrongdoing in 2016. “I haven’t done anything illegal. I’ve been targeted for one reason and one reason only: I am loyal to the president of the United States.” But emails and interviews suggest that he sold himself to the Trump campaign as a conduit to WikiLeaks. He is also connected to a web of associates, some of whom have been interviewed as part of Mueller’s investigation. Stone has been charged with seven counts, including obstruction of an official proceeding, making false statements, and witness tampering.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>VANCOUVER, British Columbia — On a recent afternoon, a Chinese politics student at the University of British Columbia waited outside a seven-bedroom mansion, worth roughly 16 million Canadian dollars, in Vancouver’s exclusive Shaughnessy neighborhood, hoping for a glimpse of Huawei’s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, Canada’s most famous detainee.

But Ms. Meng, who is out on bail awaiting possible extradition to the United States on fraud charges, did not appear. She is holed up at her other Vancouver home, a six-bedroom house worth approximately 6 million Canadian dollars in the wealthy Dunbar neighborhood, while this one is being renovated.

“Meng is a source of national pride in China, and I wanted to see a superrich Asian lifestyle,” said the student, Parker Li. “Many Chinese people from mainland China feel she is being unfairly bullied by the United States.”

Three months after her arrest, Ms. Meng has become both a subject of curiosity and a polarizing figure in Vancouver, which has had a significant concentration of Asians stretching back to its founding in the 19th century.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Trump and Republicans seek to turn the tables

As the president declared victory in the wake of the Mueller report, he and Republican allies vowed to pursue and even punish those responsible for the Russia investigation.

He called his adversaries “treasonous” and said they should be investigated. “Those people will certainly be looked at,” he said. Many of his allies agreed, while Democrats weighed whether to shift their focus entirely.

Republican response: Senator Lindsey Graham, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, announced that he would investigate whether there is any anti-Trump bias at the F.B.I. and Justice Department, and called for a new special counsel inquiry to look at the origins of the last one.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“Unforeseen things are going to happen,” he said. “That’s just the reality of baseball.”

Outfielders have not been immune to the rash of injuries. Jeff McNeil, slated to start in left field, was scratched from the lineup two days after scraping his left wrist while diving for a batted ball during a game. Center fielder Brandon Nimmo missed action because of an upset stomach after cooking chicken for himself.

“We’re going to have to teach him how to cook so he doesn’t miss any more games,” Callaway said.

The unfortunate has been familiar to the Mets of late. Last spring, outfielder Tim Tebow tripped on a sprinkler head during his first workout. Over the summer, pitcher Noah Syndergaard received a diagnosis of hand, foot and mouth disease. In the fall, David Wright retired because of chronic neck and shoulder ailments. All were reminders that the best plans can go sideways quickly.

With opening day less than a month away, here is how the roster looks.

Infielders: Who’s at first? It depends on the day. Alonso led off the exhibition season with a solo home run in his first at-bat, and Davis, who can play first or third, countered by blasting a two-run homer as he went 3 for 5 as a designated hitter.

The Mets are sure-handed up the middle, with Robinson Cano bringing his nifty fielding and a smooth stroke to second base. Shortstop Amed Rosario will be a running threat on the bases, and Adeiny Hechavarria, a late pickup who previously played with the Yankees, “covers us in so many ways,” Callaway said.

When healthy, Lowrie, who has primarily played at second base and shortstop but is expected to start at third for Mets, will provide versatility. So will Frazier, a veteran whose experience is valued in the clubhouse.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>LONDON — Long before there was such a thing as “Big Data,” there was Tim O’Donovan, a retired insurance broker who has meticulously tabulated the British royal family’s engagements with pencil and paper every day for 40 years.

In a row of old-fashioned leather-bound ledgers, in a wisteria-fringed house in the village of Datchet, just west of London, he has amassed an extraordinary collection of raw data. The Autumn Dinner of the Fishmongers’ Company, convened in October by Princess Anne? It’s in there. The opening of the Pattern Weaving Shed in Peebles, Scotland? Of the Dumfries House Maze? Of a window at the Church of St. Martin in the Bull Ring? Noted.

Mr. O’Donovan, 87, is not part of the hurly-burly of royal commentary. Not only is he not active on social media, he claims never to have seen it. (“I am glad to say I don’t have anything to do with it,” he said, a bit starchily. “Everything I’ve heard about it is negative.”)

Every year, Mr. O’Donovan releases a comparative table listing the number of engagements attended by the highest-ranking royals, setting off a flurry of barbed commentary in the British news media. The feeding frenzy comes because Mr. O’Donovan, intentionally or not, has effectively invented a metric of how much the members of the royal family work.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Chinese aviation administrators, for example, have already approved drone deliveries by the e-commerce giant JD.com and delivery giant SF Holding Co. But in the United States, it will depend on whether regulators eventually allow drone companies to have autonomous systems in which multiple aircraft are overseen by one pilot and whether they can fly beyond the vision of that pilot. Current regulations do not permit multiple drones per operator without a waiver. Operators like Wing, the drone-delivery company owned by Google parent Alphabet, have that capability.

But the immediate economic return isn’t clear yet. According to the chief executive of Wing, James Burgess, “scale doesn’t concern us right now. We strongly believe that eventually we will be able to develop a delivery service for communities that will enable them to transport items in just a few minutes at low cost.”

The company, whose drones can now travel round trip up to 20 kilometers — just over 12 miles — is participating in various stages of testing on three different continents. Its first pilot program is in a suburb of Canberra, Australia, where it is working with local merchants to deliver small packages, including over-the-counter medicine, as well as food. The Australian regulators have issued a permit to allow one pilot to operate up to 20 drones at a time with virtual oversight.

“We’ve tried to keep expectations to a minimum and stayed humble. We didn’t have a lot of preconceived notions,” Mr. Burgess said. The Wing drone is a hybrid that includes, yes, wings for horizontal flying, as well as miniaturized propellers — like a helicopter’s — that allow for hovering over a destination. Somewhat surprisingly, the most popular item ordered in the Australia pilot is coffee, which can be received — still hot — in as little as three minutes from the time the order is placed.

This spring, the company will begin a new trial in Helsinki, for which it is soliciting views as to what should be delivered.

Mr. Burgess also said that, separate from drone tests, the company and others were working on a so-called unmanned traffic management system. Akin to virtual air traffic controllers, the system will be designed to permit multiple aircraft — manned and unmanned — to fly safely in the airspace simultaneously. Wing is also one of several companies participating in a pilot program in Virginia. As with its testing in Finland and Australia, Wing will focus on the delivery of consumer goods, including food.</TEXT>

The second big cause is an investment slump. Despite all the savings available to be invested, companies are holding back. Some have grown so large and monopoly-like that they don’t need to invest in new projects to make profits. Think about your internet provider: It may have terrible customer service, but you don’t have a lot of alternatives. The company doesn’t need to invest in new technology or employees to keep you as a customer.

Beside a lack of competition, the investment slump stems from what Summers calls the de-massification of the economy. Developers aren’t building as many malls and stores, because goods now go straight from warehouses to homes. Offices don’t need as much storage space. Cellphones have replaced not just desktop computers but also cameras, stereos, books and more. Many young people have decided they’re happy living in small apartments, without cars.

For all of these economic problems, there are promising solutions. But the United States is not giving those solutions a try.

The 2017 Trump tax law is a useful case study. It is a dreadful piece of economic policy — essentially a giant effort to aggravate income inequality. Tax cuts that benefit the wealthy most are huge and permanent. Tax cuts focused on everyone else are smaller and temporary.

But the law still pumped money into the economy last year, thanks largely to those temporary tax cuts for the middle class and poor. And guess what? G.D.P. growth finally met some forecasters’ expectations, as you can see from the first chart above. The economy expanded 2.9 percent in 2018. Unfortunately, the boost seems to have been temporary. In the first quarter of this year, growth has slowed markedly, probably to about 0.5 percent. It will most likely grow faster over the rest of 2019, but not 3 percent. Once again, economists have started downgrading their expectations.

A better policy response would start with a tax cut focused on the majority of Americans, not the wealthy. And there are many other ways to take on secular stagnation. When I spoke to Summers last week, he rattled off a list:

Infrastructure projects, to jump-start investment. The retirement of coal-fired power plants, which would also lead to new investment. Stronger safety-net programs, including Social Security, to reduce the savings glut. More aggressive antitrust policies, to combat monopolies. And a Federal Reserve that, at long last, stopped making the same mistake — of overestimating both growth and inflation.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The director Peter Sellars believes that Bach wrote his “St. Matthew Passion” not as a concert work or theater piece but as a “transformative ritual reaching across time and space.” That’s the way he presented it in a revelatory performance with Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic at the Park Avenue Armory in 2014. The orchestra and chorus, each divided into two groups, as Bach stipulated, here became like combating forces in a searing story of faith and doubt, trust and betrayal, community and mob chaos.

Of course, the “St. Matthew Passion,” which tells of Christ’s last days on earth, is a church piece, a sacred oratorio. But how would Bach have presented it at the church where he worked in Leipzig? An affecting answer was suggested on Thursday at St. Peter’s Episcopal Church in Chelsea when Tenet Vocal Artists and the early-music ensemble the Sebastians, who have a string of remarkable collaborations to their credit, performed this masterpiece. It’s likely, many scholars believe, that under Bach the choruses would have been performed with one singer per part. These singers would have also shared the solo arias and even taken the crucial roles of the Evangelist and Jesus.

In its intimacy and directness, this beautifully small-scale performance by Tenet and the Sebastians was just as shattering as the Berlin Philharmonic’s near-operatic approach. In the somber, steady opening piece, the choristers of one group beseech the daughters of Zion to join the lament. “Behold!” they sing. “Whom?, the others ask. The “Bridegroom!” the first group explains. Here, the music was performed by just eight singers, four in each chorus, standing in front of the pews, one group to the left, the other to the right.

In other performances of the passion, you can be swept along by the choral majesty of Bach’s music. In this one, you heard the individual lines — and the individual qualities of the voices — with striking clarity. So, the desperate pleas and the confused responses came through like personal utterances.</TEXT>

I’ve been targeted for one reason and one reason only: I am loyal to the president of the United States.” But emails and interviews suggest that he sold himself to the Trump campaign as a conduit to WikiLeaks. He is also connected to a web of associates, some of whom have been interviewed as part of Mueller’s investigation. Stone has been charged with seven counts, including obstruction of an official proceeding, making false statements, and witness tampering.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“I didn’t know what kind of sound I wanted to make. I didn’t have no influences,” he said. “I just heard my voice in the microphone and was like, damn, I like that.” He posted a handful of songs to SoundCloud, each with a different style. The one that stuck was “Deadlocs,” a casual, boastful talker with a spooky beat from an old friend, Scum Beatz. He set goals for daily play counts, and for when he would shoot a video. Then he started creating viral moments — taking informal polls on Instagram about which high school’s students were following him the most, then driving to that school and performing an impromptu concert atop his car. Rather than goof off to gain followers, he wanted to be sure his face was connected to his song: “Putting it from your ears to your eyes.”

IN TODAY’S HIP-HOP ecosystem, distribution and starmaking systems are well-oiled; the fans are there before the artist ever shows up. Memes get disseminated quickly (and mostly discarded quickly too). Snippets of songs are used as soundtracks for selfie or dance videos. The music — the musician — is often merely an accent.

That makes social media a necessary evil and a savage tease for upstart musicians of this generation: You have to cultivate a viral-friendly image, but not let it swallow your art. “People be famous for everything other than music and that’s what they really trying to do,” Blueface said. “But they don’t know once you get famous for being this funny guy, nobody’s going to take you serious as a musician.”

Still, if it’s virality the kids want, then virality Blueface will give them. Last year, when he wasn’t yet able to Crip walk (a footwork-heavy dance pioneered by Crips), he was mocked online. So he taught himself, filming his progress. However he doesn’t always identify when the winds aren’t going his way, like when he faced backlash for recently referring to a transgender woman as “it.” He shrugged off questions about the matter.

As for his living-meme Ben Franklin tattoo, he insists he was sober when he got it, not long after he’d decided to become a rapper, but long before fans had really taken to him. “The people that went with me was like, ‘Nah, don’t do that. Do not do that.’” Blueface said. But he was determined: “This is going to be the never-forget-it,” he told them. No turning back.

Eventually, Blueface collected several songs he’d posted on his SoundCloud on “Famous Cryp,” which he initially released independently and has gone as high as No. 29 on the Billboard album chart. He is also signed to Cash Money West, and his new music, including the singles “Bleed It” and “Studio,” will be released via Republic, a division of the Universal Music conglomerate. “I’ve got two labels going full throttle with two singles,” Wack 100 said. Add to that guest appearances on songs by G-Eazy, Tyga and others, creating, he said, “so much traffic.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>BERLIN — A potential merger between Germany’s two biggest banks, Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, has generated a lot of debate, but Chancellor Angela Merkel sees no role for herself, or her government, in the discussions.

In a speech on Tuesday, Ms. Merkel urged her government “not to interfere” in the exploratory talks that were announced on Sunday. A merger would aim to create a German banking giant capable of competing globally, but the talks have drawn criticism from unions and opposition lawmakers.

The German government holds a 15 percent stake in Commerzbank, which it acquired as part of a bailout in 2009. But the chancellor insisted that is not large enough to justify involvement in the process.

“It is a small stake, therefore, this is an absolutely private decision with all of the challenges, opportunities and risks that only those involved can and must weigh,” said Ms. Merkel, a member of the conservative Christian Democratic Union, speaking at the Global Solutions Summit, a policy forum, in Berlin.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>A politician from the Popular Party, Rafael Hernando, went a step farther. “We Spaniards went there and ended the power of tribes that assassinated their neighbors with cruelty and fury,” he said on Twitter.

Spain’s far-left and third-largest party, Podemos, sided with Mexico’s president and promised to offer restoration to victims of colonialism if elected. Mr. López Obrador is “very right to demand that the king ask for forgiveness for the abuses of the conquest,” Ione Belarra, a Podemos politician, said on Twitter.

Whatever Mr. López Obrador’s political intent, his call exposed the contradictions of Mexico’s identity.

While Mexico officially celebrates the idea of mestizaje — a new race formed from the union of the European colonizers and the indigenous peoples they conquered — modern Mexico has done little to right the wrongs inherited by the brutal history of conquest. To this day, Mexico’s upper classes are predominantly white and its indigenous communities continue to suffer discrimination.

Mr. López Obrador has paid tribute to indigenous cultures. His many critics may argue that his devotion to them is a stunt, but he is the first modern Mexican president who has worked directly with people in indigenous communities.

Despite the blowback that followed his demand for an apology, Mr. López Obrador has defended his letter as necessary. And he said there was no risk of hurting relations with Spain. Indeed, Mr. López Obrador has a strong connection to that country.

In January, Mr. Sánchez, the Spanish prime minister, was the first foreign leader to visit Mexico after Mr. López Obrador took office. Among his gestures of friendship was a gift to the new Mexican president: the birth certificate of one José Obrador, born in 1893 in the Spanish region of Cantabria.

In 1917, the Spaniard did what generations of Spaniards had done before him. He went to seek his fortune in Mexico. A century later that immigrant’s grandson, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, was elected president.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>On Tuesday, the three companies said they would set up a new operating board that would replace a cluster of organizations that currently manage different aspects of the alliance. One of those organizations, a company called Renault-Nissan B.V., is the subject of a joint investigation by Nissan and Renault into potential misuse of alliance funds for Mr. Ghosn’s personal use.

The new board will have four members and seek to operate on the basis of consensus, according to a memorandum outlining the decision. It will be weighted toward Renault: Mr. Senard and Thierry Bolloré, its chief executive, will fill two of the slots. Nissan and Mitsubishi will each fill one slot.

The new organization is likely to do little to resolve questions about whether Renault would push Nissan to develop closer ties. While Renault has argued that closer ties would help them better work together and share costs, some Nissan executives and others in Japan have worried about the company’s independence and cultures. Renault owns a 43 percent stake in Nissan, which in turn owns a 15 percent stake in the French automaker, though the Japanese company doesn’t have voting rights.

The new arrangement “has nothing to do with the shareholdings and the cross-shareholdings that are still in place,” Mr. Senard said, responding to a question from Japanese news media about whether he would be able to guarantee that Nissan would not be subsumed by the French company.

Still, Mr. Senard pledged that he would “not seek to be chairman of Nissan.”

“I will respect, of course, the new governance of Nissan,” he said.

The chief executives of the three companies and Mr. Senard, a top executive at the tire-maker Michelin with a reputation for having a soft touch in handling industrial relations, sought to assuage concerns about the group’s future.

“The potential is huge,” Mr. Senard said. “The three companies together are going to increase dramatically the way they are able to efficiently work together.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>When winter is at its coldest, when everything is frozen and still, that is when I prefer to run.

After my husband has left to take our 10- and 4-year-old sons to school, I pull on two pairs of running pants, two old, knitted wool hats, two thin jackets, a thick pair of mittens, slather my face in shea butter and then I go out into the weather. The more inhospitable, the better: Once this winter, when I was running in a torrential slush storm of huge, wet, frothy chunks that were sluicing through the sky, my neighbor Bill drove by. Later he told me that he said to himself, “What idiot goes running in this? Oh that idiot!”

Though I am slow, I run as if my life depends on it. Because it does: With two children, the younger one in preschool only two mornings a week, I have almost no time or space for myself. Or for my writing, which must happen around the edges of our busy, chaotic family life.

But when I am running, I find a room of my own. In the wind and bright sun, in the cracking ice echoing through the salt marsh, in the flight of the blue heron up above, in the scratch of my ratty running shoes on the sandy, icy shoulder of the road, I am free. And mostly alone, as few runners join me on the slippery roads of winter.

So, it is there, moving slower than a granny, that I do my writing in my head. On a run, ideas will bubble up. Bits of dialogue for a novel I’m slowly piecing together from notes I have been making since 1998 will loosen from my brain. Like little ice floes in warming waters, they’ll drift unencumbered until I can see them gleaming in the sun. Plots for more novels or children’s stories, bits of poems and, sometimes, when I’m lucky, just beautiful, intact sentences will come to the fore.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — Stephen M. Ross swears he is not embroiled in a third-set tiebreaker with Larry Ellison, the billionaire co-founder of Oracle who bought the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif., a decade ago and transformed it into a tony desert party for tennis players and fans.

Still, when the moved and improved Miami Open begins this week at Hard Rock Stadium, home of Ross’s Miami Dolphins, it will not be hard to imagine Ross, a billionaire real estate developer, keeping a tiny scorecard in his back pocket.

“Larry’s done a great job,” Ross said. “He set the bar high, and it’s all great for tennis. But for us, it’s more natural not to compete, or at least to do so in our own way.”

Ross, who bought the Dolphins in 2008 and spent $550 million renovating the stadium, stepped in when IMG, which owns the Miami Open, found itself at an impasse with a Key Biscayne resident who controlled the land where the tournament had been played since 1987.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Even sharing a stage with a naked Alan Cumming, the swimming pool steals the show in “‘Daddy,’” the turgid new play by the seriously talented Jeremy O. Harris, which opened on Tuesday night at the Pershing Square Signature Center. This elegant, limpid rectangle runs across the front of Matt Saunders’s David Hockney-style evocation of a California pleasure palace.

And though it never speaks a word, the appropriately named infinity pool — filled with water that sloshes into the front rows of the audience — ripples with eloquent promises of endless fluidity, hidden depths and boundary-crossing danger. It embodies, in other words, the same exciting traits that characterized Mr. Harris’s dazzling “Slave Play,” seen earlier this season at the New York Theater Workshop.

Such elements are otherwise lacking in this portrait of a corrosive love affair between a young black artist (Ronald Peet) and an older, richer white man (Mr. Cumming, in Mephistophelean mode). This no doubt comes as surprising news to theatergoers rattled and roiled by “Slave Play,” which assessed the warping grasp of America’s slave-owning past on latter-day interracial sexual relationships.

On paper, “‘Daddy’” — directed by Danya Taymor and featuring the formidable Charlayne Woodard as an avenging mother — seems like it could surpass the outrageousness of “Slave Play.” It features what may be the strangest karaoke performance in New York right now: A sopping wet Mr. Cumming, holding a hand mic and backed by a gospel trio, sways in the middle of the pool while delivering a smoky-voiced rendition of a George Michael pop hit.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Saturn has more than 60 moons, but a handful of them do more than spangle the planet’s skies.

Snuggled close to Saturn, these innermost moons are small — Epimetheus, one of the largest, stretches just 72 miles across. But they are hefty enough to help sculpt Saturn’s rings. Orbiting at the edges of some of the planet’s main rings, or within gaps between them, these shepherd moons wield enough gravity to herd icy ring particles into place. Some like Atlas tend the bangles by pruning and neatening their edges. Others, like Pan and Daphnis, mow lanes between the rings.

“These moons kind of sweep out cavities within the rings,” said Bonnie Buratti of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who described the mini-moons in a study published Thursday in Science.

But the rings sculpt the moons, too, coating them with colorful mounds of ice and crafting some unusual shapes.

“They’re quite different than the rest of the moons,” said Carly Howett of the Southwest Research Institute, a co-author. “Some of them look absolutely crazy.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Megan Kathleen McCarthy and Edward Thomas McLaughlin were married March 9 in a self-uniting ceremony at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia. Bill Robling, an actor portraying Philadelphia’s Benjamin Franklin, led the couple in their vows.

Ms. McCarthy, 37, is the vice president for major gifts at the Academy. She was, until 2018, the director of major gifts at the New Museum, and until 2017 the senior development officer at Museum of Modern Art, both in New York. She graduated from Columbia, from which she also received a doctorate in 19th- and 20th-century German art and its perception in America. The bride also received a master’s degree in German art and cultural politics from the Courtauld Institute of Art in London. She is on the alumni board of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Columbia.

The bride is a daughter of Robin McCarthy Froehlich and John F. McCarthy III, both of Princeton, N.J. Her father is a lawyer in private practice, and is the Princeton Municipal Court judge. Her mother is a residential sales associate at Callaway Henderson Sotheby’s International Realty in Princeton. She is a stepdaughter of Susan G. Anable and Ted Froehlich.

Mr. McLaughlin, 36, who goes by Ted, was, until 2018, a real estate asset manager, focusing on commercial real estate at Cushman &amp; Wakefield in New York. He graduated from Wagner College in Grymes Hill, Staten Island.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“He’s there,” I said calmly, as though any excitement in my voice might startle him away. “Yes, yes,” my stepson whispered approvingly. And then, as we slowly moved along at 30 miles per hour with our windows down, we shouted praise at the owl for his commanding presence. Doesn’t he look majestic? Isn’t he handsome? Overjoyed and laughing, I was still conscious every moment of who I was and was not. This is not my child, in this car.

But when we saw the owl, this boy and I were of the exact same skin: pink in the cheeks and bright in the eyes. It was not quite 9 a.m., and frankly, anything seemed possible.

Then, suddenly in November, the owl was not there. Our winter coats were zipped up high on the ride to school. The tree seemed whiter, ghostly; the grass in the field was straw-brown. Fall in the Midwest often leaves as quickly as it comes.

And just like that, the owl, too, was gone.

Without him, the imminent possibility in our days seemed to fall away. Soggy green beans on the foam lunch tray, rejections from editors who once praised every word, and no one to sit with on a long field trip bus ride.

Without the owl, we were just two strangers in the car, brought together in the shadow of divorce.

When a month had passed without seeing him, I googled, “Do owls hibernate?” and searched the library books for clues.

My step son stared at me skeptically from behind his dark framed glasses. “Maybe he’s dead,” he said flatly.

In late November, he started crying suddenly in the back seat as we drove down Meadowbrook Road. “I think my mom is going to get married again.” I stopped the van near the old, dead tree and scrambled over the seat to put my arms around him.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>MOBRIDGE, S.D. — Harold Labrensz spent much of his 89-year life farming and ranching the rolling Dakota plains along the Missouri River. His family figured he would die there, too.

But late last year, the nursing home in Mobridge, S.D., that cared for Mr. Labrensz announced that it was shutting down after a rocky history of corporate buyouts, unpaid bills and financial ruin. It had become one of the many nursing homes across the country that have gone out of business in recent years as beds go empty, money troubles mount and more Americans seek to age in their own homes.

For Mr. Labrensz, though, the closure amounted to an eviction order from his hometown. His wife, Ramona, said she could not find any nursing home nearby to take him, and she could not help him if he took a fall at home. So one morning in late January, as a snowstorm whited out the prairie, Mr. Labrensz was loaded into the back of a small bus and sent off on a 220-mile road trip to a nursing home in North Dakota.

“He didn’t want to go,” said Mrs. Labrensz, 87, who made the trip with her husband. “When we stopped for gas, he said, ‘Turn this thing around.’ ”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Ms. Hargrave also has a card game, Tussie Mussie, about the Victorian language of flowers, launching in May, and a game about monarch butterflies, with the working title Mariposas, due for release next year. She is among the few women in game design — which was something she planned to research, until last December, when she noticed a newly published study exploring exactly that: “Assessing Gender and Racial Representation in the Board Game Industry.”

During the hundreds of Wingspan play tests, some gamers scratched their heads and said, “Birds? Really!?” They expressed concern that our feathered friends might not resonate with a community usually drawn to zombies, dragons, spaceships, farming, civilizations and (of course) trains.

But during the pre-order period in January, more than 5,000 games sold in a week; the game is now on its third print run, with a total of 30,000 games in English, and 14,000 in various foreign-language editions. On official release day, demand so exceeded supply that the publisher issued a public apology. Between birders and gamers, and the birder-gamer hybrid, Wingspan has found its followers — especially, naturally, on Twitter.

Ms. Hargrave’s home habitat, which she shares with her landscape-designer husband, Matt Cohen, is its own nature reserve, with vegetables in the backyard and a row of blueberry bushes out front. Inside, her watercolor paintings, of mushrooms and wildflowers, hang on the walls, complemented here and there with shells, snake skins and animal skulls.

The idea for Wingspan came to her after a game night with friends. They got talking about why there weren’t any board games tied to subjects they found interesting. Ms. Hargrave loves the game Castles of Burgundy, but pretending to be an aristocrat in high medieval France isn’t exactly her thing. She wondered, “Wouldn’t it be great if we had Race for the Galaxy” — another game that often hits her table, about building galactic civilizations — “but with birds?”

Wingspan bills itself as a card-driven, engine-building board game: players start with limited strength and slowly assemble their gameplay mechanism, which becomes more powerful with each turn. A classic example is Monopoly, in which players accrete real-estate empires, although hobby gamers would point to more sophisticated examples, such as Terraforming Mars.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The Federal Emergency Management Agency unnecessarily shared sensitive personal data of more than two million disaster victims with a contractor, subjecting that information to potential identity theft and fraud, a government memo released on Friday said.

The memo, known as a management alert and written by the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security, said the data of survivors of the 2017 California wildfires and Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria were released to an unidentified contractor.

There were no indications that the data had been compromised, the agency said in a statement on Friday night. The agency said it had worked with the contractor to scrub the unnecessary data from its computer networks.

The memo, which was dated March 15 but surfaced on Friday, found that 20 data fields were unnecessarily shared with the contractor, including details about the victims’ financial institutions, electronic funds transfer numbers and bank transit numbers. Investigators estimated 2.3 million people helped by FEMA might have been affected.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>[Sign up for our politics newsletter and join our conversation about the 2020 presidential race.]

The Democratic National Committee has selected Milwaukee as the site of its national convention, placing a spotlight on a key Midwestern battleground state that Democrats lost for the first time in three decades in 2016 and see as central to the party’s efforts to reclaim the White House.

The convention will be held next year on July 13-16 in the newly built Fiserv Forum, a 17,500-seat arena that’s home to the N.B.A.’s Milwaukee Bucks.

Milwaukee was selected over a pair of larger Sunbelt cities, Houston and Miami, to host the event.

Milwaukee organizers raised more than $10 million and reassured officials that they had secured sufficient hotel capacity for the event, ameliorating concerns that the city lacked the finances and infrastructure to support an event that regularly draws tens of thousands of out-of-town activists, officials and media.

Wisconsin holds a searing place in the Democratic Party psyche after Hillary Clinton, the party’s last presidential nominee, opted not to campaign in the traditionally blue state during the general election — a decision that some blamed for her 22,000-vote defeat in the state.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WELLINGTON, New Zealand — They arrived in New Zealand from across the Middle East and Asia, forming a tightly bound community of Muslims whose roots stretch to the mid-19th century. In recent years, migrants came to attend universities, open restaurants or to escape wars in Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq.

It felt as if everyone knew everyone. Mosques were not for Pakistanis or Somalis or Bangladeshis, but for anyone in town.

So when a gunman stormed two mosques in the city of Christchurch during Friday Prayer, killing 49 people, the news moved quickly through New Zealand’s nearly 50,000 Muslims and the wider Islamic world.

Throughout the Middle East, Asia and Oceania, families frantically sought visas so they could race to the bed sides of the injured. And they tried to get someone in New Zealand to answer their calls.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“Roots of Interior,” by Phyllis Chen, was another composition that interacted with Ms. Chase as something other than just a flutist. In the program note the composer cited as an inspiration the act of listening to two heartbeats “beating in counterpoint,” during pregnancy. The most involving part of the piece for Ms. Chase involved the flutist soaring over some shifting yet complementary heartbeat patterns. A finale that involved the player partnering with herself — made possible by a digital stethoscope attached to her — was a theatrical and touching idea, though for me it was not as sonically arresting as the rest of the composition.

By contrast, Sarah Hennies’s “Reservoir 2: Intrusion” initially seemed to sideline Ms. Chase, the better to focus on the composer’s instructions for eight vocalists from the Constellation Chor. In the early minutes, it seemed as if all the flutist would be asked to do was drone a solitary note — softly — as the singers drifted across the stage (and across a wider variety of hummed tones).

The flute’s stasis was not permanent. And while it was hard to pinpoint the exact moment at which Ms. Chase’s part began to move, by the end, the effect of a slow but steady descent was keenly felt — as was the gradual deepening of a connection between Ms. Chase and the other performers, thanks to some mirroring of pulses and exhalation effects. The composition also worked as something of a breather, on this program, in advance of a comparatively stormy piece by Tyshawn Sorey, who joined Ms. Chase as a percussionist for a performance of “Bertha’s Lair.” (The work was originally heard in an earlier edition of “Density 2036,” and was revised ahead of this performance.)

Performing well alongside Mr. Sorey — one of the most masterful player-composers of this era, in any idiom — requires a deep repository of strategies. Ms. Chase brought a substantial warehouse of tools to this meeting, venturing some whispery timbres while the percussionist was gently manipulating a small gong. At other points, Ms. Chase projected a rounded warmth during longer, tricky lines that collided with passages of greater percussive tumult. Toward the end of the performance, I had the feeling that I would happily listen to this duo configuration for a full set.

The evening concluded with a performance of Edgard Varèse’s “Density 21.5,” the 20th-century classic that has motivated Ms. Chase’s 21st-century pursuit of new repertoire. That brief work’s stark cries of heraldry served as a moving, climactic end to a show that was paced to entertain.</TEXT>

      <TITLE>Opinion | The Best Restaurant if You’re Over 50 - The New York Times</TITLE>

      <TEXT>Ina Garten, the wildly popular author of the “Barefoot Contessa” cookbooks, told me that she and her husband, Jeffrey, “go to the same restaurant over and over again until we just can’t do it anymore, then we go to another restaurant over and over again until we just can’t do it anymore. And that can last two years.” She’s 71, he’s 72 and they weren’t quite this set in their ways decades ago, she said.

Because the couple lives near New York City, acquaintances are always asking her about the latest, greatest place to eat there. “Haven’t a clue!” she told me. “Once in a while we’ll try a hot new restaurant, and then we’ll go there for two years.”

I surveyed several restaurateurs: They didn’t find her habits unusual. Older diners, they said, are more likely to be regulars — and the most frequent regulars at that.

That’s not just because we tend to have more money. It’s also because we’re tired of being invisible.

If you’re under 50 and definitely if you’re under 40, you have yet to experience how you disappear over the years, especially if you’re not a looker and all the more so if you’re a woman. Sustained gazes, casual glances and solicitous words go disproportionately to the young. To age is to feel as if pieces of you are falling or fading away, so that you somehow take up less space in the world. So that you’re harder to see.

But not by restaurants that know and value you. To them you’re luminous.

Danny Meyer, the restaurateur and hospitality guru behind Union Square Cafe, Gramercy Tavern, Shake Shack and so much more, brought up something that one of the past century’s most prominent tastemakers would say. “James Beard famously told people that when he was stopped in airports and asked what his favorite restaurant was, he answered: ‘It’s the same as yours,’” Meyer recalled. “‘It’s the one that loves me the most.’”

If that’s true to some extent for all epicures, Meyer said, it’s all the truer as they age.

He has noticed something else, too, a quirk that I think goes hand in hand with older diners’ disinclination to wait 90 minutes for a table at a thronged establishment, to jostle for the host’s attention, to submit to cooking that’s about a self-conscious chef’s strenuous inventiveness as much as our simple pleasure. “The newfangled cocktail lists, which we all have, are less exciting to people in their 50s, who by that time know what their favorite cocktail is,” Meyer said. “They don’t mind all the imaginative craft cocktails. But they also want to know that you’ll do a great job of making their go-to cocktail.” We’re not looking to trade up. We’re all about commitment.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Representative Lloyd Doggett, the Texas Democrat who questioned Mr. Mnuchin on the tax issue, found the response to be unpersuasive.

“What he said today was little more than mumble jumble double talk,” Mr. Doggett said after the hearing.

The Ways and Means chairman, Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, says his staff is working closely with the House general counsel, Doug Letter, to prepare documentation to make a request in the coming weeks. But as Democrats anticipate a legal challenge from the Treasury Department, he has been exceedingly tight-lipped about even his most basic plans.

Democrats argue that the law’s intent does, in fact, support requesting the president’s tax information, and held a hearing last month in part to bolster that interpretation. The provision in question, they point out, was born out of the Teapot Dome scandal of Warren G. Harding’s administration and aided another congressional committee in an investigation of President Richard M. Nixon’s tax positions in the 1970s.

Though the law does not require the chairman produce a rationale for a given request, Democrats believe it will help bolster their case in an eventual legal fight. In addition to the public hearing, Mr. Neal has asked other House committees to give him their own reasoning for why the documents are relevant to Congress’s work.

But the deliberative approach taken by Mr. Neal, a veteran Democrat who prefers striking legislative deals to the flash of oversight battles, has drawn the ire of liberal activists and some members of his own caucus who do not understand why he has not yet filed a request. They have tried to push Mr. Neal toward making a longer list of demands and to do so quickly — though their effect is uncertain.

Mr. Neal has repeatedly declined to answer key questions about what he will seek, including how many years worth of Trump returns he will request and whether he will try to obtain tax information on Mr. Trump’s myriad businesses.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>It’s Monday, and the news over the weekend was dominated by the horrifying violence in New Zealand.

The massacre at two mosques — in which at least 50 people were killed, apparently by a white nationalist who posted a racist manifesto online — was the latest somber reminder that violence against specific religious or ethnic communities has been persistent throughout history, though it takes different forms.

Recently, my colleague Simon Romero wrote about new efforts to remember the lynchings of people of Mexican descent throughout the American West. In doing so, advocates say, we may be able to better avoid repeating them. He wrote about such killings that took place in California:

An Anglo mob in Bakersfield went on a killing spree in 1877. Their victims: five men of Mexican descent.

About 100 men, some wielding axes, broke into the county courthouse and overpowered the jailer. In their rampage they snatched the men from the jail, held an impromptu trial with mob members as jurors, declared them guilty of horse theft and hanged them on the courthouse lawn.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>MILAN — “Our only chance at survival is to design our own beautiful extinction.”

That’s the powerful conclusion of the catalog essay for “Broken Nature: Design Takes on Human Survival,” the 22nd edition of the Milan Triennial. Running through Sept. 1, the Triennial’s main exhibition, curated by Paola Antonelli, showcases more than 100 projects from the last 30 years that address humanity’s troubled relationship with nature.

The terms “extinction” and “survival” seem contradictory. But while Ms. Antonelli, the author of the words above, believes that humankind will go the way of the dinosaur, she also hopes that our species can leave behind an intelligent legacy — a survival of sorts.

“What’s broken cannot go back, but forward into something new. So it’s not at all final,” Ms. Antonelli said in an interview. “The only thing that I consider final is our own extinction. We have, however, the power to postpone it a bit, and make it better.”

This Triennial — the second edition since the event was relaunched in 2016 after a 20-year hiatus — is a dense collection of objects, images, videos and immersive installations. Since 2018, “Broken Nature” — which contains works by designers, architects and artists representing 40 countries — has had a long run-up with salons and symposia in New York and Milan, introducing and discussing the progress and back stories of projects now on view. The meetings addressed ideas including how to accessibly present complex data, and grappled with many aspects of life in the Anthropocene age — today’s geological era, marked by human domination of the environment.</TEXT>

Public officials and health experts had given several warnings: Do not allow a student in school if they had not been vaccinated against measles.



Still, during New York City’s largest measles outbreak in a decade, a school in Brooklyn ignored that advice, resulting in one student infecting at least 21 other people with the virus.

The outbreak, at Yeshiva Kehilath Yakov in Williamsburg, is reigniting concerns that too many people in New York’s ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities are unvaccinated, as well as worries that measles would continue to spread after travelers arrived last fall from parts of Israel and Europe, where the virus was spreading.

City officials said they have struggled to increase vaccination rates in certain communities because of popularity of the widely debunked anti-vaccination movement, with parents declining vaccines for their children in fear that they increase the risk of autism.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>As ocean heat waves proliferate, problems will mount for people who depend on fishing and fish farming, or aquaculture, said Gretchen Hofmann , chairwoman of the department of ecology, evolution and marine biology at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

“If you look at geography, lots of the world’s population lives on the coast,” said Dr. Hofmann, who was not involved in the study. “Commercial fisheries, but also aquaculture facilities on the coast, will face challenges as ocean water changes. Heat waves are not great for aquaculture production.”

The study’s authors found many parts of the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans where aquatic life was especially vulnerable. These areas were home to a lot of biological diversity and had plants and animals that were already living in the warmer parts of their ranges. They were also affected by other human impacts like pollution and overfishing.

Even seabirds did not emerge from marine heat waves unscathed, most likely because their food sources either died off or moved in response to the warming.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>CARACAS, Venezuela — Thousands of opposition supporters marched to central Caracas on Saturday, defying a government ban on rallies in the Venezuelan capital’s core and testing a heavy police presence as the country struggled to emerge from its worst blackout in recent memory.

Clashes between the police and protesters were reported early in the day, but a cordon of officers stepped aside to allow the demonstrators to rally and hear from the opposition leader Juan Guaidó.

“We have to conquer public spaces in a peaceful manner,” Mr. Guaidó, standing atop a car, declared through a megaphone. “We have to prepare ourselves for very tough times.”

Power was intermittent in Caracas on Saturday, two days after the country went dark, and it remained off in large portions of the country’s west. Much of the country’s telecommunications network was offline after another power failure on Saturday, according to NetBlocks, an internet monitoring group. State utility workers say it will take days to fully restore the national grid.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>DUBLIN — A tip led the police in Dublin to a mummified head believed to belong to an 800-year-old Crusader knight, a week after it was stolen from a medieval church crypt in the city.

The body, known as the Crusader, was the oldest and most famous of several naturally mummified by the dry air and methane-rich soil in the crypt of St. Michan’s, an Anglican church on the north side of the city center. The church, parts of which date to 1095, receives around 28,000 paying visitors a year, many of whom come to see its mummies.

During a break-in over the weekend of Feb. 23 and 24, however, the Crusader was decapitated and the head was stolen. Other sections of the crypt were also desecrated and vandalized, with a nun’s mummified body badly damaged.

The archdeacon of St. Michan’s, the Rev. David Pierpoint, told Irish state radio that he had been shown the head, and another skull that was also recovered, in the local police station. They were both saturated with rainwater, he said, which could cause them to disintegrate after centuries in the unusually dry air of St. Michan’s limestone crypt.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand — One week after a terrorist attack that killed 50 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, mourners who came from around the world honored the dead Friday by sharing the Muslim call to prayer and two minutes of silence.

In a park across from Al Noor Mosque, where 42 worshipers were killed, traditional Friday Prayer became a communal event, drawing together Muslims from afar, relatives of the dead and New Zealanders in headscarves experiencing an Islamic service for the first time.

“This terrorist sought to tear our nation apart with an evil ideology that has torn the world apart — but instead we have shown that New Zealand is unbreakable,” Imam Gamal Fouda of Al Noor Mosque said, drawing applause from those gathered.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Phil Mickelson was back at Bay Hill for the first time in six years and was entertaining as ever.

More than just his seven birdies, the last one with an approach to the 18th that came up a foot from the hole, Mickelson, known as Lefty, tried to play a right-handed shot from under a mesh fence on the 10th hole. The shot got caught up in the fence and went out of bounds.

Under the old Rules of Golf, he would have had to hit his next shot from the same spot under the fence. The new rule for a stroke-and-distance penalty allowed him to move it one club-length away. Mickelson was able to get that one to the front of the green, and he two-putted from 30 feet to salvage a double bogey.

“I’ve made a lot of doubles in my day,” Mickelson said. “It’s one more; it doesn’t even hurt.”

He rallied to finish at 68, joining a group that included Graeme McDowell, Bubba Watson, Billy Horschel and Patrick Rodgers.

The British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, made one of two holes in one on the day and was among those at 69. Rory McIlroy, the defending champion, opened with a 72.

Jason Day, the last player to win at Bay Hill before Palmer died in 2016, withdrew after six holes because of a back injury. Day was coming off a three-week break. Justin Rose, who has a chance to return to No. 1 in the world this week, opened with a 71.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>If you didn’t know that the esteemed conductor Herbert Blomstedt was 91, you never would have guessed it from observing him in action with the New York Philharmonic on Thursday at David Geffen Hall. Still trim and agile, with thick white hair and plenty of stamina, he led vibrant accounts of works by Grieg and Dvorak, moving steadily and cuing the players with elegant, unfussy gestures.

Naturalness in music-making is a hard quality to define. But there is no better way to describe the glowing, unforced performances Mr. Blomstedt drew from the Philharmonic.

In a way, it was risky to begin with Grieg’s “Peer Gynt” Suite No. 1. How do you rescue this beloved staple from predictability? Actually, conductors may be avoiding it for that very reason: This was the first Philharmonic performance of the suite in almost 16 years. Mr. Blomstedt’s rendering abounded in freshness and character.

In “Morning,” the first piece, he shaped the lapping melody in the strings, which gently dips and rises, with lovely flow and directness. By acutely voicing the sonorities in the subdued yet tragic “Ase’s Death,” Mr. Blomstedt made a case for Grieg as an inspired harmonist. “Anitra’s Dance” sparkled and teased. “In the Hall of the Mountain King” — music known to anyone who watched cartoons on television as a child — was all the more ominous for the hulking, eerily restrained and heavy-footed way it began here, building inexorably to brassy terror.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Maya Turovskaya, a Russian film and theater critic, once called “the Susan Sontag of Soviet aesthetic thought,” who also co-wrote a popular documentary in the 1960s that drew parallels between Stalin-era totalitarianism and Nazism, died on March 4 at her home in Munich. She was 94.

Her son, Vladimir Turovsky, confirmed the death. She had lived in Germany for more than 15 years.

Ms. Turovskaya established a reputation for writing cultural criticism that was erudite and cleareyed — and that managed not to outrage the Soviet authorities.

In making the documentary “Ordinary Fascism” (also known as “Triumph Over Violence”), which was directed by Mikhail Romm, she avoided running afoul of censors because it is substantially an anti-Nazi film.

She and the co-writer, Yuri Khanyutin, dug deeply into archives, including the Soviet Union’s, for Nazi propaganda footage; film from Hitler and Joseph Goebbels’s private collections; soldiers’ amateur film; children’s drawings from the Theresienstadt concentration camp; and photographs of Nazi victims at Auschwitz.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear an appeal from an unidentified foreign corporation fighting a sealed grand jury subpoena issued by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel who investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election.

The court’s action means that the corporation must provide information to the special counsel or pay mounting financial penalties. It was not immediately clear whether the recently announced conclusion of Mr. Mueller’s investigation will affect the corporation’s obligations and liability. As is their custom, the justices gave no reason for turning away the appeal.

The case, In re Grand Jury Subpoena, No. 18-948, has been cloaked in secrecy. But redacted court rulings and Supreme Court briefs have provided a few hints, including that an unnamed foreign government, referred to in court papers as Country A, owns the corporation.

The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected the corporation’s argument that it could not be forced to comply with the subpoena. The corporation had argued that federal courts have no jurisdiction over criminal cases involving foreign governments.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The strikes have underscored a significant generation gap in concern about climate change, particularly in a handful of countries. The 20 warmest years on record have all come in the past 22 years , essentially the lifetime of today’s children and young adults.

In a recent Pew survey, carried out in 26 countries, a significantly larger share of young people said they worried about the threat of climate change, compared to people over the age of 50, in the United States, France, Australia and the Philippines.

In the Pew survey, the generation gap was significant even after statisticians controlled for political affiliations. And in the five years since the global survey began, concern about climate change has swelled overall among Americans, but at a far higher rate among young people. Other surveys have found that younger Republicans to be significantly more concerned about climate change than older members of the party.

Mark Margolin, whose daughter organized a youth climate march in Washington last summer, said he understood the urgency of climate change intellectually but didn’t feel the panic the younger generation feels emotionally. Partly, he said, it’s because he has seen the world overcome other global challenges — the fear of a Cold War nuclear confrontation, for instance.

But also, it’s because parents like him are focused on short term. “I don’t have the fear and panic they do,” he said. “Adults are so focused on, ‘Can I pay the bills, am I going to be able to pay my daughter’s college tuition?’”

Nadia Nazar, 16, from Baltimore, one of the organizers of the Friday rally in Washington, said young people didn’t see the crisis in the same way.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Pope Francis on Saturday replaced Cardinal Ricardo Ezzati, the embattled archbishop of Santiago, Chile, after he became embroiled in the country’s spiraling sex abuse and cover-up scandal.

Francis accepted Cardinal Ezzati’s resignation and named a temporary replacement to govern Chile’s most important archdiocese: the Spanish-born Capuchin friar and current bishop of Copiapo, Chile, Monsignor Celestino Aos Braco.

The 77-year-old Cardinal Ezzati had submitted his resignation to Francis two years ago when he reached the mandatory retirement age of 75. But Francis kept him on, and Cardinal Ezzati became the flash point of survivors’ ire for mishandling several cases of abuse.

Francis himself became embroiled in the scandal after initially discrediting victims during his 2018 trip to Chile, sparking a crisis in confidence in the Chilean hierarchy and his own leadership.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>North Carolina’s Ninth Congressional District will remain without representation in the House until at least September.

The state elections board, which concluded last month that fraud had tainted November’s voting for the seat, ruled on Monday that a new open primary would be held in the district on May 14 and a new general election on Sept. 10. If a second primary is required — a second-place candidate may request another round of voting if no one receives at least 30 percent of the vote — the general election would be pushed to November.

The off-year race, likely to be competitive, expensive and closely scrutinized for signs of new misconduct, drew a handful of candidates even before the board set the schedule. The filing period for candidates begins next week.

There is scarce precedent for a start-to-finish redo of a congressional election, and officials in both parties are bracing for a season of sharp-edged advertisements and high-profile campaign stops, after a scandal that left North Carolina voters shaken.</TEXT>

Hard work and discipline help girls outperform boys in class, but that advantage disappears in the work force. Is school the problem?

A New Model to Stop the Next School Shooting

“I’m a psychiatrist, but I’m also a parent. Where do my loyalties lie?,” asks this Opinion essay writer.

The Parkland students became a force for gun control legislation and boosted the youth vote. Here’s how they changed America’s response to mass shootings.

      <TEXT>In announcing his decision to open the archives of the papacy of Pius XII, which includes his response to the Holocaust, Pope Francis declared, “The church is not afraid of history.” The Catholic Church’s actions regarding this period of papal history contradict Fran cis’ assertion.

I was co-chairman of the International Catholic-Jewish Historical Commission, cited in your ar ticle. It was established by the Vatican and comprised three Catholic and three Jewish international scholars. Our mandate was to review the 11 volumes of archival material concerning the Holocaust period, published by the Holy See’s Secretariat of State; to raise relevant questions that in our opinion were not satisfactorily resolved by the available documentation; and to issue a report.

In October 2000 we released our preliminary report and posed 47 questions. The commission was disbanded shortly thereafter. To this day these questions have not been fully addressed by the Vatican.

I applaud Pope Francis’ decision to open these archives to scholars so that we will finally know what Pius XII did or did not do while the Nazis murdered millions.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Pius XII “has been too superficially judged and criticized for some aspects of his pontificate,” Bishop Pagano wrote. The opening of the archives will allow historians to investigate his papacy, “without prejudice, through access to the new documents, in all its realistic scope and richness.”

Criticism of Pope Pius’ perceived inaction during World War II gained traction in 1963 with the publication of Rolf Hochhuth’s play, “The Deputy, A Christian Tragedy,” which accused the pope of indifference to the Holocaust. It was so contentious that Pope Paul VI ordered the release of some official Vatican records relating to the wartime period. Between 1965 and 1981, church historians published 11 volumes of documents that critics called selective and insufficient.

Pope John Paul II gave researchers access to some archival collections pertaining to some aspects of Pius XII’s pontificate in 2004. When Pope Benedict XVI opened the archives relating to Pius XI, in 2006, “work was already underway for the progressive preparation of the documentary material of Pius XII, which many scholars demanded with ever greater insistence,” wrote Bishop Pagano in L’Osservatore Romano.

But independent scholars clamored for direct access to the papers.

Sara J. Bloomfield, director of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington said in a statement on Monday that it was “long overdue for speculation to be replaced by rigorous scholarship, which is only possible once scholars have full access to all of these records. This is important for the sake of historical truth, but there is moral urgency too: we owe this to the survivor generation, which is rapidly diminishing.”

Rabbi David Rosen, the international director of interreligious affairs with the American Jewish Committee, said Francis’ decision to make the materials fully available would be “enormously important to Catholic-Jewish relations.” The committee has pressed the Vatican for more than three decades to make the wartime papers public.

In a statement, Rabbi Rosen said scholars would now be able to evaluate the “historical record of that most terrible of times — to acknowledge both the failures as well as the valiant efforts made during the period of the systematic murder of six million Jews.”</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The War of the Five Kings has lost one king but remains in full swing, with three of the seven kingdoms in open rebellion. Plots are in place to remove another king from the board by the end of the season, but there are so many plots, counterplots, and untrustworthy types lurking about, it’s hard to keep track. Focusing on these might help:

An awful lot of children in Westeros and Essos get mistreated — molested, murdered, sold or sacrificed (as we learn the daughter-raping Craster has done with his 99 sons, and would have done with his 100th, Gilly’s baby). Some 8,000 newborns were killed in Astapor because slave masters wanted to prove their eunuch soldiers had no sense of empathy. Other children are orphaned when their parents are killed in one or another war.

Few kids can fend for themselves — the Stark children survive primarily because they have guardians who step in and take care of them. (The Hound isn’t a bad babysitter!) We don’t know yet what kind of parental substitutes the White Walkers are, but you’d figure they have to be better than Craster. (They at least show an interest.) No wonder Dany develops a savior complex — there are so many children in this brutal world who desperately need saving.

Spies are everywhere. Jon Snow goes undercover with the Free Folk as a defector (and doesn’t fully fool them). Varys convinces Ros to spy on Littlefinger (or perhaps she lured him in, looking to spill some valuable info about her boss’s travel plans). Varys then tries to thwart Littlefinger by plotting with the Tyrells, but Littlefinger’s prostitute Olyvar easily seduces Loras Tyrell and reports back. Key bit of intel: Loras is set to marry … someone. Littlefinger concludes that the someone is Sansa and alerts the Lannisters, leading to Tywin’s strategic matchmaking of Cersei with Loras and Tyrion with Sansa, which none of them are happy about. (Littlefinger gives Ros to Joffrey, which doesn’t end well.)

Even though Jorah Mormont is no longer a spy, he’s clearly worried that new Team Dany member Barristan Selmy knows he was, and could use that fact against him. And the ultimate spymaster in all of Westeros, of course, is the Three-Eyed Raven, who recruits Jojen Reed and Bran Stark for his mysterious purposes. At least Jon, Ros, Olyvar and Jorah know the risks of their espionage: Bran has no idea what’s in store for him. (“The raven is you” does not count.)

When did the plans for the Red Wedding coalesce? The Frey alliance with the Starks was in tatters by the end of Season 2, but they didn’t plan it alone.

When did Tywin Lannister get in on the action? Clues come early in Season 3, when he embarks on a correspondence spree. (Notice that when both Tyrion and Cersei come to visit him, he is preoccupied with writing letters). Tywin’s first missives would most likely be to the Freys, who want revenge on the Starks and an end to the war in the Riverlands.</TEXT>

Most entries come with recipes, and some with dissenting opinions. There’s Eric Ripert on gefilte fish, Gail Simmons on pickles, Ruth Westheimer on pomegranates (and a tip on removing the seeds) and the spice expert Lior Lev Sercarz on kosher salt. The book is the work of Alana Newhouse, the founder of Tablet, an online magazine of Jewish news and culture. She said the selections reflect the foods that relate most closely to the American Jewish experience.

      <TEXT>This season shapes up as an embarrassment of riches like few before. Game Winner and Improbable, ranked first and third in the latest National Thoroughbred Racing Association poll for the age group, will be entered in the Rebel Stakes on Saturday at Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs, Ark., which Baffert has won a half-dozen times. The two horses had been ticketed for the San Felipe Stakes last weekend at Santa Anita until the track was temporarily closed to address an inordinate number of equine fatalities.

The Rebel Stakes could have resembled a Baffert private party had he enlisted the fifth-ranked horse, Mucho Gusto; instead, he will be dispatched elsewhere later this month as the trainer plays traffic cop — scattering his charges, lest they deny one another Derby qualifying points from the most prominent prep races.

“Bob seems to have it down to a science,” said the jockey Mike Smith, who was Justify’s pilot and has since landed aboard the Peter Fluor-owned Roadster, a recent winner at Santa Anita. “The program is just like clockwork. It’s not one thing but all the little things. He is not only there to be in it, but to win it.”

That Baffert would become master of the 3-year-old universe was the longest of long shots after he made an unusual transition from training quarter-horses in his late 30s. His hair was snow-like even then, and hidden under a cowboy hat, when he appeared unannounced at the venerable Claiborne Farm in Lexington., Ky., and declared, “I’d like to see Secretariat,” the retired legend whose record time in the Derby has stood for four and a half decades.

The proprietor, Seth Hancock, leaned from out his desk in a back office, sized up Baffert and directed him outside, to a spot where visitors waited to board a tour bus.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>To these groups, liberation rarely means more than the replacement of some form of foreign occupation with local despotism. They avow democracy but never hold a truly fair election. They create secret police, parallel security services, politburos, inner- and outer-party structures. They make war on their neighbors to distract from their inevitable failure to create prosperity at home. Their leaders preach struggle and martyrdom while living lavishly.

Nor should you be surprised by the scantiness of Western coverage: It would complicate a convenient narrative of the Israel-Palestinian conflict that holds that the former isn’t just the principal oppressor, but the only one. That feeds into the larger progressive fiction that the great crimes of the post-World War II world are the ones the West perpetrated on the rest of the world. In fact, far worse were the crimes of non-Westerners — Mao Zedong, Pol Pot, Saddam Hussein, Fidel Castro, Idi Amin, Nicolás Maduro — perpetrated against their own people.

The same goes for the Palestinians. More have died in Syria in the last decade, mainly on account of the depredations of the ostensibly pro-Palestinian regime of Bashar al-Assad, than have been killed by Israel. And Palestinians continue to be the victims of leaders who see no reason to subject themselves to regular elections, or financial audits, or criminal investigations, or any other mechanism of political or moral accountability.

That lack of accountability is chiefly a Palestinian failure. But it’s abetted by Western journalism that, with some honorable exceptions, for too long has been depressingly incurious about any form of Palestinian suffering for which Israel cannot be held responsible. That is sometimes a function of ideological bias, but it is also a failure of basic reporting.

Israelis and their friends abroad often complain about slanted coverage that seems to find fault in everything they do, while finding excuses in everything their adversaries do. If the protests in Gaza demonstrate anything, it’s that Palestinians hardly benefit from the coverage, either.

Palestinian lives and livelihoods should matter despite who harms them. A world that shrugs at Hamas’s abuse of its own people merely licenses the abuse to continue, unchecked.

      <TEXT>“Julietta,” a 1930s opera by the Czech composer Bohuslav Martinu, has long been a rarity outside the composer’s homeland. One problem may be the surreal story.

The residents of an isolated coastal town have no memories of anything before the present moment. Whenever strangers show up, which isn’t often, they are forced to tell the townspeople their stories; appropriating someone else’s memories is at least better than having none. But, of course, those stories are soon forgotten. Then Michel, a bookseller from Paris, arrives in search of a girl he’d heard singing three years earlier. Her voice has haunted him since.

The work was an auspicious success at its 1938 premiere in Prague. But, beyond its convoluted plot, the score, for all its harmonic lushness and myriad colorings, has been deemed frustratingly episodic and stylistically eclectic.

Leon Botstein, the conductor and tireless champion of overlooked works, considers “Julietta” an operatic masterpiece that at least deserves a place in the repertory. On Friday at Carnegie Hall, he made his case by leading a winning cast and the American Symphony Orchestra in a vibrant concert performance.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Powell freed himself for a shot — a potential go-ahead 3-pointer that would have given Seton Hall the lead, and perhaps even the title — but sent it a fraction long. The ball hit the back of the rim, the Wildcats ran out the clock, and Willard and Powell didn’t regret a thing.

“I thought it was going to drop,” Powell said.

Said Willard, “I’ll take him shooting the last second-shot every day.”

And why not?

The 6-foot-2 Powell scored 78 points in three games in three days at the Big East tournament, carrying the Pirates to the title game.

His week began with a 31-point effort in a dominant win over Georgetown in which, at one point, he single-handedly outscored the Hoyas, 29-25. He followed that with a 22-point outing in a semifinal upset of Marquette, and then added 25 points, 5 rebounds, 4 assists and 3 steals in the loss to Villanova in the final.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>In “Roadblock to Reform: Mitch McConnell” (editorial, March 9), you quote the Senate majority leader saying something that should be astounding: “ Because I get to deci de what we vote on.” He speaks the truth, it’s accepted as a routine matter of fact, and that is what should astound any believer in democracy.

How can it be that one man can prevent a vote, for any reason he choo ses, in a body whose function is to vote on things? How can there be no possibility of overruling his decision, no possibility of, say, a petition signed by two-fifths of senators requiring a full airing of a bill — a discussion, a debate — leading to a vote? Or some such provision.

Our system gives the Senate majority leader a veto power greater than the president’s because the decision is absolute and cannot be reversed. How can this be O.K.?</TEXT>

      <TEXT>A Florida jury on Thursday found a former police officer, Nouman K. Raja, guilty of manslaughter in the fatal shooting of a black man who had been waiting for help on a highway after his car broke down, lawyers for the man’s family said.

One of the lawyers, Benjamin L. Crump, announced on Twitter that Mr. Raja had been found guilty of both counts against him: manslaughter by culpable negligence and attempted first-degree murder with a firearm.

The 2015 killing of the man, Corey Jones, a 31-year-old musician and housing inspector, drew national attention as one in a series of killings of black men by the police. The encounter also highlighted Florida’s so-called Stand Your Ground law, which Mr. Raja’s lawyer had cited in his defense.

[Update: Nouman Raja sentenced to 25 years in fatal shooting of Corey Jones.]

“This verdict is a vindication of the good man that was Corey Jones, and an utter repudiation of a criminal who tried to hide behind a badge,” the lawyers for Mr. Jones’s family said in a statement.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Good Wednesday morning. Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today.
• A new fight over the Affordable Care Act broke out on Tuesday, as Democrats denounced the Trump administration for asking a federal appeals court to invalidate it. The surprise decision, which could leave 21 million people without health insurance if the court agrees, gave Democrats a chance to move past impeachment and discuss kitchen-table issues like health care.
• The most enduring legacy of Robert S. Mueller’s investigation may be his decision not to take action on President Trump’s norm-shattering interventions in the law enforcement system. Future presidents may feel entitled to take similar actions.
• As the Trump administration celebrates Mr. Mueller’s finding that the president did not conspire with Russia, a darker theme is emerging: a message that Mr. Trump’s perceived enemies will pay.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Thomas Scott appears to be a loving father, a decent neighbor and an all-around jolly good fellow. But the benevolent smile lurking under the pre-World War I mustache is deceiving: The man is a sanctimonious prig who siphons all the fun out of life. When time comes to choose between his faith and his family’s happiness, he hesitates, but not that long. Sorry, family.

This is a meaty premise, and it’s easy to see what drew the Mint Theater Company, that esteemed excavator of long-forgotten works, to “The Price of Thomas Scott.”

The only problem is that Elizabeth Baker’s drama, from 1913, is not very good, making for an inauspicious introduction to the Mint’s “Meet Miss Baker,” a multiyear project dedicated to the British playwright that will involve two more productions, readings and a book.

Thomas Scott (Donald Corren) is a draper with a struggling store he’s desperately trying to sell. His wife, Ellen (Tracy Sallows), dreams of moving to the London suburb where she met her husband. Their daughter Annie (Emma Geer) is a gifted milliner who’d love to polish her craft in Paris, while their son Leonard (Nick LaMedica) aspires to a school the Scotts can’t afford.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Mr. Alpers said the challenge for New Zealand would mainly be getting the ammunition and guns that already exist out of circulation. Half of Australia’s states had some kind of gun registration plan in place before the 1996 reforms, making it easier for the authorities to know what weapons were out there and what needed to be brought in.

New Zealand only registers 4 percent of its weapons. According to the police, about 250,000 people in the country own an estimated 1.2 million to 1.5 million firearms. It is unclear how many of them would be affected by the ban.

“New Zealand is at a considerable disadvantage to countries that have had registries, because there’s no way of tracing the firearms because they don’t know who’s got them,” Mr. Alpers said. “We’re relying entirely on the honesty of the gun owner to turn it in.”

Ms. Ardern said that fair compensation would be paid to all those who participate.

Noting that there would be some limited exceptions for specific purposes, especially in rural areas, she said she expected the new law to be in place by April 11, the end of Parliament’s next session.

In the interim, as of Thursday afternoon, a change in regulations would alter the licensing rules for the weapons that would eventually be banned. To avoid a rush on purchases, weapons that now require a basic A Class license will fall under an E Class gun license, which is already much harder to obtain, and which the prime minister said would now be impossible to get.

“I can assure people there is no point in applying for such a permit,” she said.

      <TEXT>Israel: President Trump said the U.S. should recognize Israel’s authority over the Golan Heights, which the country seized from Syria in 1967 and has since become one of the world’s most disputed territories. The president’s announcement, in a Twitter post, marks a significant shift in decades-long American policy.

China: An explosion at a chemical plant in the eastern province of Jiangsu killed at least six people and injured 30 others, officials said. The plant had been flagged for over a dozen safety problems after a government inspection last year.

South Korea: Two men were arrested, accused of setting up hidden cameras in hair dryer holders, satellite boxes and electrical sockets at 30 motels across the country and streaming the “intimate private activities” of 1,600 unsuspecting guests, the latest in a wave of voyeuristic spycam crimes known as molka.

Britain: The police and counterterrorism officials are investigating attacks on four mosques in the city of Birmingham, which is home to one of the country’s biggest Muslim communities.

Asylum dispute: The British Home Office cited biblical verses about vengeance to deny asylum to an Iranian who said he had converted from Islam to Christianity because it was a “peaceful” religion.

Netherlands: Prosecutors said they planned to bring terrorism charges against a man accused of killing three people on a tram in the city of Utrecht this week, as well as multiple counts of murder or manslaughter.

Afghanistan: In the city of Mazar-i-Sharif, a power struggle between President Ashraf Ghani and a regional strongman cast a chill on the normally rollicking celebrations of Persian New Year.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>It could be political in an interesting way: the decay of civility and how it’s O.K. to lie?

Mearns In that way, it’s very relevant. It is about telling the truth and about how people don’t tell the truth now or how you have to learn how to mask things.

Bergasse We had two women adapt the script, and they basically went through it with a #MeToo pen. It’s more palatable for an audience in 2019, but it still gets across the same humor, the same relationships. This story is really the battle of the sexes.

You don’t want to get rid of that because that still exists and that’s fun, but you want to get rid of the grossness. [Laughs] The horrible sexism.

Mearns It’s fun. Like that whole harp solo. I do — what is it called?

Mearns There it is. The Lindy Hop.

Bergasse The Angel starts playing the harp at this party to entertain and everybody falls asleep, so she decides to change the rhythm of the harp solo and she swings it. She gives it a swing rhythm. I thought, wouldn’t it be kind of fun if it was based in swing dance? So we took stuff from Lindy Hop.

      <TEXT>“La Clemenza di Tito,” Mozart’s least-loved opera, returned to the Metropolitan Opera on Saturday evening to an auditorium yawning with empty seats.

The cast wasn’t to blame. With the fiercely empathetic mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato as Sesto, a trouser role she has made her own, this revival made a strong case for the work’s rehabilitation on musical grounds.

But by recycling the airless Rococo-dress staging by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle from 1984, the Met perpetuates the prejudice against the work as dramatically irrelevant. His take is so short on ideas that it might be more honest to let the singers wear their own clothes and call it a concert production.

Mozart wrote “Clemenza” on commission in 1791 for the coronation of Leopold II as king of Bohemia. In the opera, a Roman emperor forgives his friend, who had been compelled by love to conspire against him. The 1734 libretto, by Pietro Metastasio, already felt sclerotic by Mozart’s theatrical standards; he tweaked it to create ensemble numbers amid the sequence of dry recitatives and pomp-and-firework arias that made up a traditional opera seria.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>More than 250 jails in 33 states now offer Vivitrol to at least some addicted inmates, typically just before their release, according to Andy Klein, a senior scientist for Advocates for Human Potential, a company that provides training to prisons and jails with addiction treatment programs.

“It’s been practically doubling every year,” Mr. Klein said, though he added that only a few dozen jails offer buprenorphine (also known as Suboxone) or methadone.

Ms. DiPierro’s lawsuit alleges that in prohibiting medication for a diagnosed condition, the Bureau of Prisons is violating the Eighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment. It also accuses the prisons bureau of violating the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which protects people with disabilities from discrimination by federal agencies .

“The Bureau of Prisons is denying her a reasonable accommodation for her disability, and also discriminating between different disabilities,” said Jessie Rossman, a staff lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, which is representing Ms. DiPierro and also represented the plaintiff in last year’s county-level case. “Inmates with chronic conditions like diabetes are allowed to continue to take their medically necessary treatment.”

Ms. Rossman said the case appeared to be the first challeng e to the Bureau of Prisons policy on medication-assisted treatment, adding, “What’s now coming across loud and clear is that the standard of care to treat opioid use disorder is medication-assisted treatment, and it’s ineffective and unlawful to prevent individuals from accessing their treatment and medication for that disease.”

The prisons bureau declined to comment on the lawsuit.

Giving Ms. DiPierro naltrexone before her release would do nothing to help her withdrawal symptoms and cravings while in custody, Ms. Rossman said, and staying on methadone was safer for Ms. DiPierro regardless, because it had worked for her.

Other state chapters of the A.C.L.U. — in Maine and Washington State — have filed cases seeking methadone or buprenorphine treatment in jails.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Europe demonstrates, however, that socialism and the free market are compatible. The basic issue before the Democratic Party now is how far left to go. Bernie Sanders calls himself a socialist. Kamala Harris calls herself a progressive. John Hickenlooper, conciliator, says he can “get stuff done.”

The notion that American elections are won in the center was buried by Trump. The energy in the Democratic Party lies in the progressive camp. It stems from anger at a skewed economy and millennial disgust at the elitist turn that cost the Democrats their working-class base and much of small-town America. This opened the way for Trump. My own inclinations are centrist, but not a “centrism” that cares more for Goldman Sachs than the opioid crisis. I don’t see how the Democrats can eschew a new era’s left-leaning energy and win.

A word of caution: The United States was founded in contradistinction to, not as an extension of, Europe. Self-reliance is to America what fraternity is to France: part of its core. American space — so immense, so un-European — conjures in Americans a bristling independence of spirit that wants government out of their lives.

Nations do not cast off their cultural essence. I don’t think soaking the rich — Ocasio-Cortez’s proposed 70 percent wealth tax — is going to get a Democrat to the Oval Office. Nor are the accusations of “worker exploitation” that chased Amazon and 25,000 jobs out of New York — a stupid waste.

The dirty secret of European welfare states is that they tend to be business-friendly. As Monica Prasad, a sociology professor at Northwestern University has pointed out, Sweden has a lower corporate tax rate than the United States. The sweet spot for Democrats is getting business to buy in to progressive reform. America can be nudged in a French direction without losing its self-renewing essence.

France is also home to the yellow-vest protests from the marginalized. So much for social cohesion, you might say. But there’s a lesson. As James McAuley observed in The New York Review of Books, those vests reflect, above all, a “material demand to be seen.” Socialism is no silver bullet. The basic requirement of any Democratic candidate is to make the forgotten, the struggling and the invisible of American society feel visible again.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>“I never thought I was anyone that Max Mara would be interested in,” says Ian Griffiths, the Italian house’s creative director, who has been with the company for 32 years. The thoroughly English, Derbyshire-bred ex-punk rocker won a student competition to work there in 1987 and has remained ever since. Over the course of his tenure as head designer, the 57-year-old has quietly and consistently created subtle, enduring classics: the perfect crisp white shirt, the reliably flattering cigarette trouser and the famously cozy Teddy Bear coat.

Even before he was a fashion student at Manchester Polytechnic in the 1980s, Griffiths was inspired by his hero David Bowie and experimented wildly with his own image, creating avant-garde outfits that he’d wear to the legendary music venue (and New Order haunt) in town, the Haçienda. “That side of me is still part of my psyche, even though I don’t look like that now,” says Griffiths, who has moved on to a uniform of bespoke Savile Row suits. He began his career at Max Mara, based in Reggio Emilia, as a junior designer under the French stylist Anne-Marie Beretta, who helped define the look of working women in the ’80s with her iconic double-breasted 101801 camel coat; she remains one of his greatest influences. Beretta created clothes that “gave women the chance to break into the corridors of power,” says Griffiths, who lives in Milan and London. “I still design for that woman, but as she would be today.”</TEXT>

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has long pressed for the move, thanked Mr. Trump on Twitter.

The president also signed an executive order directing federal agencies to link grants and other funds to how colleges and universities enforce free speech rights, a cause célèbre for conservatives who argue that their voices have been silenced.

      <TEXT>I found these rules absurd and fascinating in the odd world they described, a world that operated according to logic I was certain, as a naïve and liberal-leaning college student, was about to be tossed aside in this world. It all seemed so obviously fake, so contrived. I assumed that the photos and stories were justified, because they were clearly written by someone in on the joke. It was the classic mistake of someone who has read a lot of books but not interacted with a lot of people.

But here’s the thing about reading trash ironically. It still seeps into your worldview. Many of the tropes we’ve become accustomed to — bump watches, “flaunting body after baby,” the endless scrutiny of women’s bodies for the slightest fluctuation in weight — were just becoming established as story lines. I read these too, through a feminist lens, pointing to the pictures and saying, “This is messed up!” But I still bought my magazines every week.

This habit lasted for more than a decade. Sometime in the middle of all of it, in my mid-20s — around 2008 or ’09 when I did a search on OkCupid for all the straight men who listed James Baldwin on their profiles and came up with two accounts in all of New York City — I began to think that maybe these magazines were on to something. Maybe the rules they were describing weren’t so ludicrous after all. I began to read these less as texts of a retrograde country to deconstruct and more, even though I couldn’t even really admit it to myself, as an instruction manual.

Unsurprisingly, it did not yield great results in dating or in life.

Even as I’ve worked to disregard the rules of tabloids, I still believe in the validity of gossip. Gossip lives a weird half-life. People invested in our current definitions of respectability and civil discourse will claim gossip is damaging, worthless, the refuge of the unintelligent. But if you are ever trying to find stories of people left off the official historical record, gossip becomes a place where you can maybe catch a glimpse of them, a distorted version of them trapped in scandal.

What’s the instruction manual in the saga of Meghan Markle? I am not sure. I think there is something to learn about the falseness of narratives. I read gossip most ferociously during the time in my life when I was trying to figure out how to create an adult life, and the silly stories seemed, because of their dumb cruelty, to be sharing some kind of rude truth.

It must be strange to live as Ms. Markle does, to experience a pregnancy — somehow a universal experience and something intensely personal — with millions of people deciding what it must mean for you. I can only imagine that you look straight ahead and keep moving.

      <TEXT>A teenager in Atlanta was fatally shot on Friday after knocking on the door of an apartment he mistakenly thought was the one he shared with his girlfriend, the authorities said.

The teenager, Omarian Banks, approached the apartment at about 12:30 a.m. on Friday and began knocking on the door under the impression that his girlfriend was inside, the police said. After Mr. Banks, 19, walked away, a man inside appeared on his second-floor balcony to confront him and opened fire.

The man suspected of being the gunman, Darryl I. Bynes, 32, has been charged with murder.

Mr. Banks’s girlfriend, Zsakeria Mathis, 23, had been waiting for Mr. Banks because he had called and asked her to open the door. The conversation lasted three seconds.

“I went to open the door and he wasn’t standing right there,” Ms. Mathis said on Sunday. Ms. Mathis could not see Mr. Banks so she started walking out of her apartment and soon heard faint voices.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>Making the plan a part of the budget helped pressure upstate and suburban legislators to support it. But the final version still needs to ensure that a clear majority of revenue goes toward the city’s subways, rather than suburban rail lines. The subways serve by far the most riders, have been underfunded and are in by far the worst shape.

Reaching an agreement on public financing of elections could be harder. Many legislators, especially in the State Assembly, have opposed it. After public pressure, Mr. Heastie backed the measure. The plan is worth the fight. A similar system has worked well in New York City, where it has increased competition in elections, one way to improve the responsiveness of elected officials.

One thing that needs to be included in the final deal is full funding for early voting, without shifting the cost to local election boards. Though the state approved much-needed legislation in January allowing New Yorkers to vote up to 10 days before an election, local election boards need funding to the changes.

But the proposal includes elements that have little to do with budgeting and deserve more careful attention. One such proposal would give police departments expansive discretion to withhold arrest information. Cuomo officials say the proposal is meant to protect individual privacy by addressing a scurrilous practice in which private websites post mug shots, then demand payment to remove them. But the measure is far too broad, and could prevent the public from learning basic information about who is arrested and why. On Friday, efforts were underway to narrow the scope of the measure to limit it to the release of mug shots, according to a spokesman for Mr. Heastie.</TEXT>

      <TEXT>The number of podcast listeners has increased sharply this year, according to a new report.

More than half the people in the United States have listened to one, and nearly one out of three people listen to at least one podcast every month. Last year, it was more like one in four.

“That’s the biggest growth we’ve seen, and we’ve been covering podcasts since 2006,” said Tom Webster, a senior vice president at Edison Research, a company that tracks business trends.

The latest facts and figures on the rise of podcasting come courtesy of the just-published 2019 edition of The Infinite Dial, an annual survey conducted this January and February put together by Edison Research and Triton Digital, an audio technology and advertising company.

In addition to identifying broader trends, the survey’s researchers dug into different age groups and found that listeners over age 55, who were slower to adopt podcasts, are finally catching up. In 2018, 13 percent of people in that age group identified themselves as monthly podcast listeners; this year, 17 percent of those in that demographic have taken up the habit.</TEXT>
